 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

G. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

In consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 **The Merger**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3-105 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " **MGCL** "),
CPA16 shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Following the Merger, Merger Sub
will continue as the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Company** ") and
a direct subsidiary of W. P. Carey Holdco LLC, a direct subsidiary of W. P.
Carey, and the separate corporate existence of CPA16 will cease in accordance
with Section 3-114 of the MGCL, and, from and after the Effective Time (as
hereinafter defined), the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the MGCL. W. P. Carey will maintain its existence as
a real estate investment trust (" **REIT** ") under Section 856 of the Code.

 



 

Section 1.2 **Closing**. The closing (the " **Closing** ") of the Merger will
take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by
the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
DLA Piper LLP (US), 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, or
at such other time and place as is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto
(the date on which the Closing takes place, the " **Closing Date** ").

 



 

Section 1.3 **Effective Time**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, as part of the Closing, CPA16 and Merger Sub shall execute
articles of merger (the " **Articles of Merger** ") in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A and shall file such Articles of Merger in
accordance with the MGCL with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation
of Maryland (the " **SDAT** ") and shall make all other filings and recordings
required under the MGCL with respect to the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as W. P. Carey and CPA16 shall agree should be
specified in the Articles of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes
effective, the " **Effective Time** "); **provided that** such time is not
earlier than the time the Articles of Merger are filed of record and does not
exceed 30 days after the Articles of Merger are accepted for record. Unless
otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 1.4 **Charter and Bylaws**. The articles of incorporation of Merger
Sub (the " **Merger Sub Charter** ") and the bylaws of Merger Sub (the "
**Merger Sub Bylaws** ") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, shall, except for any required

 



      
 

 



 

amendments, be the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Company, until further amended in accordance with the respective terms of such
articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable Maryland Law.

 



 

Section 1.5 **Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company**. Unless
otherwise determined by W. P. Carey and CPA16, from and after the Effective
Time (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Company, in each case until duly removed or replaced in
accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Company and the MGCL.

 



 

Section 1.6 **Per Share Merger Consideration**.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of W. P. Carey, CPA16,
Merger Sub, any other W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any stockholder of CPA16 (the
stockholders of CPA16, the " **CPA16 Stockholders** "), each share of common
stock, $0.001 par value per share, of CPA16 (" **CPA16 Common Stock** ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share (other than the
Dissenting Shares discussed in Section 1.7), the rights attaching to such
share shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, that number (the " **Exchange
Ratio** ") of validly issued fully paid and non-assessable shares of W. P.
Carey Common Stock (the " **Per Share Merger Consideration** ") equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the Stock Value by the Average W. P. Carey
Trading Price, and rounding the result to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share of
W. P. Carey Common Stock, payable in the manner set forth in Section 1.9;
**provided, however** , that (x) if the number determined by dividing the
Stock Value by the Average W. P. Carey Trading Price is less than or equal to
0.1447, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1447 and (y) if the number determined by
dividing the Stock Value by the Average W. P. Carey Trading Price is greater
than or equal to 0.1842, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.1842. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, each share of CPA16 Common Stock that is
owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof
or payment therefor.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 1.7, at the Effective Time, all shares of CPA16 Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of CPA16 Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration or any cash pursuant to Section 1.9(e).

 



 

Section 1.7 **Dissenters Rights**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that the right to demand payment of fair value of the CPA16 Common
Stock in connection with the Merger is available under the MGCL, any
outstanding shares of CPA16 Common Stock held by a Dissenting Stockholder ("
**Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration but shall become the right to receive such

 



      
 

 



 

consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the MGCL; **provided, however** , **that** each share of CPA16
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Dissenting Stockholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws his demand or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right to receive payment of fair
value, pursuant to the MGCL, shall be deemed to be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest. As used in this Agreement, " **Dissenting Stockholder** "
means any record holder or beneficial owner of shares of CPA16 Common Stock
who is entitled to demand and receive payment of the fair value of such
holders shares pursuant to Section 3-202 of the MGCL and who does not vote
for the Merger and complies with all provisions of the MGCL (including all
provisions of Section 3-203 of the MGCL) concerning the right of holders of
shares of CPA16 Common Stock to object to the Merger and obtain fair value for
their shares.

 



 

(b) CPA16 shall give W. P. Carey (i) prompt notice of any demands for payment
of fair value pursuant to the applicable provisions of the MGCL received by
CPA16, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the MGCL and received by CPA16 relating to rights of appraisal and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct the conduct of all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value
under the MGCL. CPA16 shall not, except with the prior written consent of W.
P. Carey, make any payment with respect to any such demands for payment of
fair value, or settle, or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such
demands for payment of fair value.

 



 

Section 1.8 **Adjustments to Exchange Ratio**. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, combination,
subdivision, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible into CPA16 Common
Stock or W. P. Carey Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to CPA16 Common Stock (or
for which a record date is established) and with respect to W. P. Carey Common
Stock (or for which a record date is established), after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time; **provided that** nothing in this Section 1.8
shall be construed to permit W. P. Carey, Merger Sub, any other W. P. Carey
Subsidiary or CPA16 to take any action with respect to their securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.9 **Recordation of Exchange; Payment of Merger Consideration**.

 



 

(a) **Delivery of W. P. Carey Common Stock**. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, W. P. Carey shall cause the transfer agent for
the W. P. Carey Common Stock to record the issuance on the stock records of W.
P. Carey of the amount of W. P. Carey Common Stock issuable as Per Share
Merger Consideration to each holder of CPA16 Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.6(a).

 



 

(b) **No Interest**. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on unpaid
dividends declared in respect of the CPA16 Common Stock and with a record date

(c) **No Further Ownership Rights**. All Per Share Merger Consideration paid
by W. P. Carey in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the CPA16
Common Stock in respect of which such Per Share Merger Consideration was paid.
At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the
share transfer books of CPA16 shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company
of the shares of CPA16 Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) **No Liability**. None of W. P. Carey, Merger Sub, or any employee,
officer, director, partner, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable
to any person for any part of the Per Share Merger Consideration or for
dividends or distributions with respect thereto delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of CPA16 Common Stock
five years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
the property of, any federal, state, local government, or agency or any court,
regulatory or administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a " **Governmental Entity**
"), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
W. P. Carey or its designated Affiliate free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(e) **Fractional Shares**. No certificates for fractional shares of W. P.
Carey Common Stock shall be issued hereunder. To the extent that a holder of
CPA16 Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of W. P. Carey Common Stock, computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of CPA16 Common Stock held by such holder, such holder shall
instead receive a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount
equal to such fraction multiplied by the Average W. P. Carey Trading Price.

 



 

(f) **Paying and Exchange Agent**. Prior to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to CPA16 to act
as agent for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " **Paying
and Exchange Agent** "). W. P. Carey shall take all steps necessary to enable,
and shall cause, the Surviving Company to provide to the Paying and Exchange
Agent immediately following the Effective Time the aggregate cash portion of
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon cancellation of the CPA16
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common Stock. The
funds deposited with the Paying and Exchange Agent in respect of the Per Share
Merger Consideration is hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund**."
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later
than the 10th Business Day thereafter, the Paying and Exchange Agent shall pay
to each holder of CPA16 Common Stock the amount of cash such holder is
entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional share of W. P. Carey Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.9(e).

 



 

(g) **Termination of Exchange Fund**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of CPA16 Common Stock one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to W. P. Carey or its designated Affiliate,
upon demand, and any holder of CPA16 Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article I shall thereafter look

 



      
 

 



 

only to W. P. Carey or its successor in interest for payment of its claim for
the Per Share Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Law).

 



 

(h) **Investment of Exchange Fund**. The Paying and Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by W. P. Carey, on
a daily basis; **provided, however** , **that** such investments shall be in
(i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency
or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the

United States or any state thereof having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $3,000,000,000 or (iv) a money market fund having assets of at least
$1,000,000,000. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of, and paid to, W. P. Carey or its designated
Affiliate.

 



 

(i) **Withholding Rights**. W. P. Carey or the Paying and Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of CPA16 Common
Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the

Merger with, and the acceptance for record of the Articles of Merger by, the
SDAT; (C) such filings and approvals as may be required by any applicable
Environmental Laws; and (D) any such consent, approval, order, authorization,
registration, declaration, filing or permit that the failure to obtain or make
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) **SEC Documents**.

 



 

(i) W. P. Carey has made available to CPA16 (by public filing with the SEC or
otherwise) a true and complete copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and definitive proxy statement filed by W. P. Carey (or its
predecessor W. P. Carey and Co. LLC) with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (the "
**W. P. Carey SEC Documents**"), which are all of the documents required to
have been filed by W. P. Carey (or its predecessor W. P. Carey and Co. LLC) with
the SEC since that date. As of their respective dates, the W. P. Carey SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to
such W. P. Carey SEC Documents and none of the W. P. Carey SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement. W. P. Carey does not have any outstanding
and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to the W. P. Carey SEC
Documents. The consolidated financial statements of W. P. Carey and W. P.
Carey Subsidiaries, included in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents complied as to
form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis

 



      
 

 



 

during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto,
or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of
Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in accordance
with applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring adjustments, none of which are material), the consolidated financial
position of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
of their respective dates and the consolidated statements of income and the
consolidated cash flows of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries for
the periods presented therein, in each case, except to the extent such
financial statements have been modified or superseded by later W. P. Carey SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. No
W. P. Carey Subsidiary is required to make any filing with the SEC.

 



 

(ii) W. P. Carey maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance that (A) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (B) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific

the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences.

 



 

(iii) W. P. Careys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that (A) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by W. P. Carey in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (B) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to W. P. Careys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of W. P. Carey required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 



 

(iv) Since December 31, 2012, W. P. Carey has not received any notification of
a "material weakness" in W. P. Careys internal controls. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "material weakness" shall have the meaning assigned to it
in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) **Absence of Certain Changes or Events**. Except as disclosed or reflected
in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement or as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(e) of the W. P. Carey Disclosure
Letter, since December 31, 2012 there has not been: (i) (A) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in
cash, shares or property) with respect to any of W. P. Careys capital stock
except for regular quarterly dividends on the W. P. Carey Common Stock; (B)
any amendment of any term of any outstanding equity security of W. P. Carey or
any W. P. Carey Subsidiary; (C) any repurchase, redemption or other

adversely affect its assets, liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

or business, except insofar as may have been required by a change in
applicable Law or GAAP; (E) any W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, or (F)
any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey
Subsidiary of any indebtedness for borrowed money other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices.

 



 

(f) **No Undisclosed Material Liabilities**. Except as disclosed in the W. P.
Carey SEC Documents, as set forth in Schedule 2.2(f) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of W. P. Carey
or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary of a nature that would be required under GAAP to
be set forth on the financial statements of W. P. Carey or the notes thereto,
other than: (i) liabilities adequately provided for on the balance sheet of W.
P. Carey dated as of December 31, 2012 (including the notes thereto) as
required by GAAP, (ii) liabilities incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business subsequent to December 31, 2012.

 



 

(g) **No Default**. None of W. P. Carey, Merger Sub or any material W. P.
Carey Subsidiary is in default or violation (and no event has occurred which,
with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the W. P. Carey Charter
or the W. P. Carey Bylaws, or the Merger Sub Charter or the Merger Sub Bylaws,
or any provision of the comparable charter or organizational documents of any
of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) any loan or credit
agreement, note, or any bond, mortgage or indenture, to which W. P. Carey,
Merger Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries is a party or by which W.
P. Carey, Merger Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound, or (iii) any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to W. P. Carey,
Merger Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, except in the case of (ii)
and (iii) for defaults or violations which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(h) **Compliance with Applicable Laws; Regulatory Matters**. Except for
environmental matters, which are addressed in Section 2.2(n), W. P. Carey and
the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " **W. P. Carey
Permits**"), except where the failure so to hold such W. P. Carey Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the W. P. Carey Permits,
except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.
Except as disclosed in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, the businesses of W. P.
Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of
any Law, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to W. P. Carey
or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is pending or, to W. P. Careys Knowledge,
threatened, other than those the outcome of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material
Adverse Effect. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is subject
to any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a W.
P.

 



      
 

 



 

Carey Material Adverse Effect. None of W. P. Carey or Merger Sub is subject to
any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity
that prohibits or would reasonably be expected to prohibit any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by this Agreement. None of W. P. Carey or
Merger Sub has taken any action, nor have any other steps been taken or have
any legal proceedings been commenced, nor to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey,
threatened, against W. P. Carey or Merger Sub, for the winding up, liquidation
or dissolution of W. P. Carey or Merger Sub.

 



 

(i) **Litigation**. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(i) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter or the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, there is no suit, action
or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, threatened against
or affecting W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any such suit, action or proceeding pending against W. P. Carey or any
W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets which
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially
delay any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(j) **Taxes**.

 



 

(i) Each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
valid extension to file). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete
in all material respects. W. P. Carey and each W. P. Carey Subsidiary has paid
(or W. P. Carey has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes required to be
paid. All material Taxes which W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries are
required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been
withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and sales, gross
receipts and use Taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the
extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities
within the time period prescribed by Law. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior
to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with
GAAP for all material Taxes payable by W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. W. P. Carey and each W. P. Carey Subsidiary has
established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to establish and
maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate for the payment
of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since December 31, 2012,
neither W. P. Carey nor any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and
other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of
property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey
Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(j) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is the
subject of any material audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of
federal, state, local or foreign Taxes; to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, no
material audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of federal, state,
local or foreign Taxes involving W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is
being considered by any Tax authority; and no material audit, examination or
proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving W.
P. Carey or any W. P.

 



      
 

 



 

Carey Subsidiary has occurred since December 31, 2009. No deficiencies for any
Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of W. P.
Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary, proposed) against W. P. Carey or any of
the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which
individually or in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in
effect or are pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of W. P.
Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not
yet due or payable and for which appropriate reserves have been established on
their respective financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(ii) W. P. Carey (A) has been subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning
of the Code and has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT
beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C)
has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected
to result in the failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT. Each
Subsidiary of W. P. Carey which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has, during the taxable year of W. P. Carey ended December
31, 2012 and at all times thereafter, (A) been classified for federal income
Tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not owned any
assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause W. P.
Carey to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. During the taxable year of W.
P. Carey ended December 31, 2012 and at all times thereafter, each W. P. Carey
Subsidiary which is a corporation, and each other issuer of securities in
which W. P. Carey holds securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of
the Code but excluding "straight debt" of issuers as described in Section
856(m) of the Code) having a value of more than 10 percent of the total value,
or more than 10 percent of the total voting power, of the outstanding
securities of such issuer has been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l)
of the Code. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary holds any
asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 or (y) that is subject to a consent
filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

 



 

(iii) For each taxable year beginning with its taxable year ended December 31,
2009 through the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, W. P. Carey and Co. LLC
was properly classified and qualified to be taxed as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

 



 

(iv) None of W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries is (A)
subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreement or (B) in
violation of or in default under any Tax Protection Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement or has changed any method of accounting for
Tax purposes.

 



 

(vi) W. P. Carey does not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other
than W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law),
(B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.

 



 

(vii) Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary (x) has requested,
received or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Entity related
to Taxes or has entered into any written and legally binding agreement with a
Governmental Entity relating to Taxes, (y) has engaged in any transaction of
which it has made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Governmental
Entity to avoid the imposition of any penalties related to Taxes, or (z) has
participated in any transaction that could give rise to a disclosure
obligation as a "listed transaction" under Section 6011 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or any similar provision under applicable Law.

 



 

(k) **Pension and Benefit Plans and Employee Relations**. Schedule 2.2(k) of
the W. P. Carey Disclosure Letter lists each written material "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" **ERISA** ") (referred to herein as
" **Pension Plans** ") or "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), other than as set forth in the W. P. Carey SEC
Documents, providing benefits to any current employee, officer or director of
W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries or any entity that is or
required under Section 414 of the Code to be treated with W. P. Carey as a
single employer (an " **ERISA Affiliate** ") or with respect to which W. P.
Carey or any ERISA Affiliate could have any liability that would reasonably be
expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "
**Benefit Plans** "). Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws. Each Pension Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such
Pension Plan is so qualified under all currently applicable provisions of
Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the knowledge of W. P. Carey, no
circumstances exist that would adversely affect the qualification of any such
Pension Plan. No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Each Benefit
Plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms. Schedule
2.2(k) of the W. P. Carey Disclosure Letter lists each material employment,
severance, consulting or other contract or plan with or for the benefit of any
officer, director or employee of W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries containing a "change of control" provision that provides for any
material payment, additional benefits, vesting or acceleration of benefits or
rights or otherwise upon the execution of this Agreement or the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(l) **Information Supplied**. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by W. P. Carey or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or in any materials to be delivered by W. P. Carey or
Merger Sub to potential financing sources in connection with the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement will (i) in the case of the Form S-4, at the
time it becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, (ii) in the case of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, at the time of the mailing thereof or at the time the W.
P. Carey Stockholder Meeting is to be held, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii)
in the case of any materials to be delivered to potential financing sources in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at the date
such information is delivered, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will (with respect to W. P. Carey, Merger
Sub, their respective officers and directors and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries)
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act; **provided that** no representation is
made as to statements made or incorporated by reference by CPA16.

 



 

(m) **Intangible Property**. W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries own,
possess or have adequate rights to use all trademarks, trade names, patents,
service marks, brand marks, brand names, computer programs, databases,
industrial designs and copyrights necessary for the operation of the
businesses of each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " **W. P. Carey Intangible Property**"), except where the
failure to possess or have adequate rights to use such properties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. All of the W. P. Carey Intangible
Property is owned or licensed by W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
free and clear of any and all Liens, except those that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material
Adverse Effect, and neither W. P. Carey nor any such W. P. Carey Subsidiary
has forfeited or otherwise relinquished any W. P. Carey Intangible Property
which forfeiture has resulted in, individually or in the aggregate, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, the use of W. P. Carey Intangible Property by W.
P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries does not, in any material respect,
conflict with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an
appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without
limitation, any intellectual property right, trademark, trade name, patent,
service mark, brand mark, brand name, computer program, database, industrial
design, copyright or any pending application therefor, of any other Person,
and there have been no claims made, and neither W. P. Carey nor any of the W.
P. Carey Subsidiaries has received any notice of any claims or otherwise has
Knowledge of any claims that any of the W. P. Carey Intangible Property is
invalid or conflicts with the asserted rights of any other Person or has not
been used or enforced or has failed to have been used or enforced in a manner
that would result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of any
of the W. P. Carey Intangible Property, except for any such conflict,
infringement, violation, interference, claim, invalidity, abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.

**Environmental Law** " means any Law of any Governmental Entity relating to
human health,

 



      
 

 



 

safety or protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, the
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended (" **CERCLA** "), and (y) " **Hazardous Material** " means

under any applicable Environmental Law. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(n)

treatment, storage, recycling, transportation, disposal or "release" (as
defined in 42 U.S.C. (S) 9601(22) (" **Release** ")) by W. P. Carey or any W.

(iii) None of W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary has received written
notice of a claim, that has not been resolved, to the effect that it is liable
to a third party, including a Governmental Entity, as a result of a Release of

including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order, injunction,
or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the

necessary or desirable to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, the proper
officers and directors of CPA16, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub shall take all
such necessary action. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective
Time, CPA16 shall timely file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC all CPA16

(b) Each of CPA16, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to each
other party if (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) it fails to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
**provided that** the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice; and, **provided** , **further** , **that** failure to
give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes
of Sections 5.2(b) or 5.3(b), as the case may be.

 



 

Section 4.3 **Fees and Distributions Payable to CAM and its Affiliates**.

 



 

(a) As a condition and inducement to the willingness of W. P. Carey and Merger
Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of CPA16, CAM, Foreign Subsidiary and Merger Sub
agree that, concurrently with and conditioned upon the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the amended and restated advisory
agreement dated as of September 28, 2012, between CPA16 and CAM (the " **CPA16
Advisory Agreement** ") and the Asset Management Agreement, dated as of

 



      
 

 



 

May 2, 2011, between CPA16 and Foreign Subsidiary (the " **Asset Management
Agreement** " and together with the CPA16 Advisory Agreement, the " **CPA16
Advisory Agreements** "), shall automatically terminate without any action by
any of the parties thereto and, in connection with such termination and the
Merger, (i) CAM and Foreign Subsidiary each hereby waives its right to receive
a Subordinated Disposition Fee (as such term is defined in the CPA16 Advisory
Agreements) (the " **Subordinated Disposition Fee** ") and (ii) Merger Sub
hereby waives its right to receive a distribution of Capital Proceeds upon a
Change of Control Event, and related allocation of profits and losses, under
the CPA16 LLC Agreement (as such terms are defined in the CPA16 LLC Agreement)
(such distributions, together with the Subordinated Disposition Fees being the
" **Back-End Amounts** "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein or in the CPA16 Advisory Agreements (i) CPA16, CAM, Foreign Subsidiary
and Merger Sub each agrees that CAM, Foreign Subsidiary and Merger Sub shall
continue to be entitled to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued
pursuant to the CPA16 Advisory Agreements and the CPA16 LLC Agreement
(collectively, the " **Accrued Amounts** ") prior to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are not expressly waived
pursuant to the preceding sentence of this Section 4.3, and (ii) for the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated and this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 6.1, subject to the credit described in Section 4.3(b) below,
neither CAM nor Foreign Subsidiary nor Merger Sub hereby waive any Back-End
Amounts, and any and all Back-End Amounts and Accrued Amounts shall continue
to be payable in accordance with the terms of the CPA16 Advisory Agreements
and the CPA16 LLC Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
either Section 6.1(g) or Section 6.1(h), (ii) the CPA16 Termination Fee is
actually paid in accordance with Section 6.2(d), and (iii) the Back-End
Amounts are payable as a result thereof, then the amount of such CPA16
Termination Fee shall be credited against the Back-End Amounts payable
pursuant to the CPA16 Advisory Agreements and the CPA16 LLC Agreement, unless
a portion of such CPA16 Termination Fee has already been credited against the
Special GP Amount pursuant to Section 4.13, in which case any remaining amount
of the CPA16 Termination Fee, if any, shall be credited against the Back-End
Amounts payable pursuant to the CPA16 Advisory Agreements and the CPA16 LLC
Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.4 **Tax Treatment**.

 



 

(a) CPA16 shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
on a timely basis all Tax Returns and amendments thereto required to be filed
by CPA16 or any of the CPA16 Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless an alternative manner is required to avoid imposition of any
penalties, fines or additions to Tax) prior to the Closing Date (after
electing all available automatic extensions of time to file such Tax Returns).
Prior to filing any such Tax Returns, CPA16 shall deliver draft copies
(together with supporting documentation, including Tax Return work papers) to
W. P. Carey for W. P. Careys review and comment, and CPA16 shall accept all
reasonable comments of W. P. Carey with respect to such Tax Returns. CPA16
shall pay all Taxes required to be paid by CPA16 prior to the Effective Time.
W. P. Carey shall have a reasonable period of time (but in no event less than
30 days) to review and comment on such Tax Returns and amendments prior to
filing. If the parties do not agree on the draft Tax Returns or amendments,
the parties shall hire a nationally recognized

 



      
 

 



 

accounting firm reasonably acceptable to CPA16 and W. P. Carey to prepare the
contested Tax Returns or amendments.

 



 

(b) CPA16 and CPA16 Merger Sub will take all necessary actions, including but
not limited to making sufficient distributions prior to Closing if needed, to
assure that CPA16 will qualify as a REIT for its Tax year ending on the
Closing Date. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, CPA16 shall, and shall cause each CPA16 Subsidiary to,
facilitate all reasonable requests of W. P. Carey with respect to the
maintenance of CPA16s REIT qualification.

 



 

(c) Merger Sub, W. P. Carey and CPA16 shall report the Merger for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and all relevant state and local income tax purposes as a
reorganization governed by Section 368(a)(1)(A), unless otherwise required by
Law or administrative action, and shall comply with any applicable Tax
reporting requirements.

**Solicitation Period End Date** "), CPA16, acting directly or indirectly
through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors, agents,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers,
finders, representatives or controlled Affiliates of CPA16 or any CPA16

assets, books, records and personnel of CPA16 and any CPA16 Subsidiary and
furnish non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; **provided, however** , that any such
non-public information shall, to the extent not previously provided to W. P.
Carey, Merger Sub or their respective representatives, be provided to W. P.
Carey or Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently with it being
provided to any Person given such access, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any
CPA16 Competing Transaction, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a CPA16 Competing
Transaction or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations
or the making of any CPA16 Competing Transaction and (iii) grant a waiver
under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by
CPA16 to the extent necessary to allow the other party thereto to submit any
CPA16 Competing Transaction or inquire, propose or make an offer that may lead
to a CPA16 Competing Transaction to the CPA16 Special Committee in compliance
with this Section 4.5. W. P. Carey agrees that neither it nor any Affiliate of
W. P. Carey shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective representatives not to, participate in discussions
with (other than at the request of the CPA16 Special Committee), any person
that it knows has made, or is considering or participating in discussions or
negotiations with CPA16 or its representatives regarding, a CPA16 Competing
Transaction: **provided** , **however** , that nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit or restrict W. P. Carey from making or conducting public
communications or solicitations regarding a CPA16 Competing Transaction or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except (i) as expressly permitted by this Section 4.5, or (ii) with
respect to any Exempted Person until receipt of the CPA16 Stockholder
Approval, from the Solicitation Period End Date until the Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1,
CPA16, acting directly or indirectly through any of its officers, directors,
investment advisors, agents, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders, representatives or controlled
Affiliates of CPA16 or any CPA16 Subsidiary, shall cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Persons with
respect to any CPA16 Competing Transaction and request the immediate return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished. Except as
specifically provided in this Section 4.5, from the Solicitation Period End
Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1, CPA16, acting directly or indirectly
through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors, agents,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers,
finders, representatives or controlled Affiliates of CPA16 or any CPA16
Subsidiary, shall not (i) initiate, solicit, propose, cause (including by
providing information) or take any action designed to, or which would
reasonably be expected to, facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a CPA16 Competing Transaction, other than with respect to any Exempted
Person (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data concerning, CPA16
or any CPA16 Subsidiary, including their properties, books and records, to any

otherwise cooperate with, any CPA16 Competing Transaction or any proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a CPA16 Competing
Transaction, (iii) approve, publicly endorse, publicly recommend or enter into
any CPA16 Competing Transaction or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
similar agreement with respect to any CPA16 Competing Transaction (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
Section 4.5) (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "), (iv) publicly
propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to take any of the foregoing
actions, (v) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Statute

4.5(a)(iii) above and with respect to any Exempted Person until receipt of the
CPA16 Stockholder Approval, terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by CPA16 in
respect of or in contemplation of a CPA16 Competing Transaction. The foregoing
will not prevent CPA16 from, after the end of the Solicitation Period End
Date, providing non-public information about CPA16 or any CPA 16 Subsidiary
(subject to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) to, and engaging in
discussions and negotiations regarding a possible CPA16 Competing Transaction
with, a prospective acquirer in response to a proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a CPA16 Competing Transaction which CPA16
received prior to the Solicitation Period End Date, or which CPA16 receives
after the Solicitation Period End Date that did not result in whole or in part
from a breach of this Section 4.5(b), and which the CPA16 Special Committee
determines in good faith after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, would result (if

 



      
 

 



 

consummated in accordance with its terms) in, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a CPA16 Superior Competing Transaction.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly provided by Section 4.5(d), at any time after the date
hereof, the CPA16 Special Committee shall not (i) (A) publicly withhold or
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to W. P. Carey or Merger
Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to W. P. Carey or Merger Sub), its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger or otherwise publicly repudiate the adoption,
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the CPA16 Special
Committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) adopt, approve, publicly declare advisable or recommend or
publicly propose to adopt, approve, declare advisable or recommend any CPA16
Competing Transaction, (C) allow its recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger to be excluded from the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (D) fail to
recommend against any CPA16 Competing Transaction within ten (10) Business
Days after such CPA16 Competing Transaction is publicly announced, or (E) if a
tender or exchange offer relating to equity securities of CPA16 is commenced
by a Person unaffiliated with W. P. Carey, fail to send to the CPA16
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act,
within ten (10) Business Days after such tender or exchange offer is first
published, a statement disclosing that the CPA16 Special Committee recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in clauses
(A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), an " **Adverse Recommendation Change** "), or (ii)
adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or cause or permit CPA16 or any CPA16
Subsidiary to execute or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance
with this Section 4.5).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the CPA16 Stockholder Approval, the CPA16 Special
Committee shall be permitted to either (i) terminate this Agreement in order
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a CPA16
Superior Competing Transaction, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(g) and
Section 6.2, or (ii) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, in each
instance, if and only if (A) the CPA16 Special Committee has received a CPA16
Competing Transaction (whether or not from an Exempted Person) that, in the
good faith determination of the CPA16 Special Committee, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a CPA16
Superior Competing Transaction, after having complied with this Section
4.5(d), and, with respect to any Person who is not an Exempted Person, (B) the
CPA16 Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the CPA16 Special Committees fiduciary duties to the CPA16
Stockholders under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
either terminating this Agreement or effecting an Adverse Recommendation
Change, in each instance in accordance with this Section 4.5(d), (i) the CPA16
Special Committee shall provide a written notice to W. P. Carey and Merger Sub
that it intends to take such action and describing (1) the basis for its
determination, and (2) the material terms and conditions of the CPA16 Superior
Competing Transaction that is the basis of such action (including the identity
of the party making the CPA16 Superior Competing Transaction and any financing
commitments related thereto, which shall include any fee letters, which
letters may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein, as
applicable) (a " **Change of Recommendation Notice** "); (ii) during the three
(3) Business Day period following

 



      
 

 



 

W. P. Careys and Merger Subs receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice,
CPA16 shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, investment advisors,
agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders, representatives or controlled Affiliates of CPA16, or any
CPA16 Subsidiary to, negotiate with W. P. Carey and Merger Sub in good faith
(to the extent that W. P. Carey and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the
need for the proposed termination of this Agreement or the proposed Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable; and (iii) following the close of
business on the last day of the three (3) Business Day period or such greater
period of time as may be permitted by the CPA16 Special Committee in its sole
discretion, the CPA16 Special Committee shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed in writing by W.
P. Carey and Merger Sub in response to the Change of Recommendation Notice,
that such CPA16 Competing Transaction continues to constitute a CPA16 Superior
Competing Transaction (whether or not from an Exempted Person), and with
respect to any Person who is not an Exempted Person, a failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the CPA16 Special
Committees fiduciary duties to the CPA16 Stockholders under applicable Law.
If any amendment to the financial terms or any material term of any CPA16
Superior Competing Transaction is made, the CPA16 Special Committee shall
deliver a new Change of Recommendation Notice to W. P. Carey and Merger Sub,
and CPA16 shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 4.6(d); **provided** , **that** , with respect to any and all such new
Change of Recommendation Notices, the references in this Section 4.6(d) to
"three (3) Business Days" shall be deemed to be references to "one (1)
Business Day".

 



 

(e) Within forty-eight (48) hours after the expiration of the Solicitation
Period End Date, CPA16 shall (i) notify W. P. Carey in writing of the identity
of each person, if any, that, in accordance with this Agreement, the CPA16
Special Committee has determined to be an Exempted Person and (ii) provide W.
P. Carey with the material terms and conditions of any CPA16 Competing
Transaction received from any Exempted Person prior to the Solicitation Period
End Date. CPA16 shall keep W. P. Carey reasonably and promptly informed of any
material changes in the status, terms or conditions of any CPA16 Competing
Transaction received from any Exempted Person. Except as may relate to an
Exempted Person, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date, CPA16 shall
(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours of receipt), advise W. P. Carey of receipt by CPA16 or any of its
Affiliates of (A) any CPA16 Competing Transaction or (B) any request for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to any CPA16 Competing
Transaction, the terms and conditions of any such CPA16 Competing Transaction
or request (including the identity of the party making such CPA16 Competing
Transaction), (ii) keep W. P. Carey fully and promptly informed (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material changes in the status,
terms or conditions of any such CPA16 Competing Transaction (it being
understood that any change or modification to any financial term or condition
of any CPA16 Competing Transaction shall be deemed to be a material change) or
request, and (iii) provide W. P. Carey promptly with (a) an unredacted copy of
any such CPA16 Competing Transactions made in writing (including any financing
commitments relating thereto, which shall include any fee letters (it being
understood that any such fee letter may be redacted to omit the numerical
amounts provided therein)) and (b) a written summary of the material terms of
any CPA16 Competing Transactions not made in writing (including any financing
commitments and any fee

 



      
 

 



 

letters relating thereto (it being understood that any such fee letter may be
redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein)).

 



 

(f) So long as this Agreement has not been terminated, no Adverse
Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the CPA16 Special Committee
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.5 by CPA16, acting directly or
indirectly through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors,
agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders or other agents, representatives or controlled Affiliates of
CPA16 or any CPA16 Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
4.5 by CPA16.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, a " **CPA16 Competing Transaction** "
shall mean any proposal or offer for, whether in one transaction or a series
of transactions, any of the following (other than the transactions expressly
provided for in this Agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving CPA16 (or any
of the material CPA16 Subsidiaries); (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage,
pledge, transfer or other disposition of 50% or more of the assets of CPA16
and the CPA16 Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any bona fide
financing transactions which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have as
a purpose or effect the sale or transfer of control of such assets; (iii) any
issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing fifty percent (50%) or more of
the voting power of CPA16 and the CPA16 Subsidiaries; (iv) any
recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
type of transaction with respect to CPA16 and the CPA16 Subsidiaries in which
a Person shall acquire beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of CPA16 and the
CPA16 Subsidiaries; or (v) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more
of the voting power in the election of directors exercisable by the holders of
outstanding CPA16 Common Stock (or any of the CPA16 Subsidiaries).

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, a " **CPA16 Superior Competing
Transaction** " means a bona fide proposal for a CPA16 Competing Transaction
made by a third party which the CPA16 Special Committee determines (after
taking into account any amendment of the terms of the Merger by W. P. Carey
and/or any proposal by W. P. Carey to amend the terms of the Transaction
Documents or the Merger), in good faith and after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, (i) is on terms which are more favorable from a
financial point of view to the CPA16 Stockholders than the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) would result in such
third party owning, directly or indirectly, at least 90% of the CPA16 Common
Stock then outstanding (or all or substantially all of the equity of the
surviving entity in a merger) or at least 90% of the assets of CPA16 and the
CPA16 Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) is reasonably capable of being
consummated and (iv) was not solicited by CPA16, any CPA16 Subsidiary or any
of their respective officers, directors, investment advisors, investment

representatives or controlled Affiliates in breach of this Section 4.5.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Nothing contained in this Section 4.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit CPA16 or the CPA16 Special Committee, directly or indirectly through
its Representatives, from disclosing to CPA16s stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to its stockholders if the CPA16 Special Committee
has determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with applicable Law; **provided that**
the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such
disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.6 **Public Announcements**. CPA16 and W. P. Carey shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents, except as otherwise required by Law
in a manner which makes consultation impracticable.

 



 

Section 4.7 **Transfer and Gains Taxes**. W. P. Carey or Merger Sub shall,
with CPA16s good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file,
or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax,
" **Transfer and Gains Taxes** "). From and after the Effective Time, W. P.
Carey or the Surviving Company shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and

and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and W. P. Carey shall
indemnify and hold harmless, each director and officer of CPA16 or any of the
CPA16 Subsidiaries (the " **Indemnified Parties** "), as and to the same

Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 4.8, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify CPA16 and,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and W. P. Carey, promptly
thereof; **provided that** the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of CPA16, the Surviving Company and W. P. Carey except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

 



 

(b) W. P. Carey agrees that it shall maintain in full force and effect for a
period of six years from the Effective Time all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations of the personal liability of, the
directors and officers of CPA16 and the CPA16 Subsidiaries provided for in the
CPA16 Charter or CPA16 Bylaws or any provision of the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any of the CPA16 Subsidiaries, as in effect as of
the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, including the Merger; **provided, however** , **that** all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims (each a " **Claim** ") asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Claim.
Prior to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey shall purchase directors and
officers liability insurance

 



      
 

 



 

coverage for CPA16s and CPA16 Subsidiaries directors and officers, in a form
reasonably acceptable to CPA16, which shall provide such directors and
officers with runoff coverage for six years following the Effective Time of
not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially
less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than, the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by CPA16 and the
CPA16 Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) This Section 4.8 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all

Section 6.6 **Payment of Expenses**.

 



 

(a) In the event that CPA16 or W. P. Carey becomes obligated to pay any
expenses under Section 6.2 (the " **Expense Amount** "), CPA16 or W. P. Carey,
as applicable, shall pay to the party entitled to receive such payment (the "
**Receiving Party** ") from the amount deposited into escrow in accordance
with this Section 6.6(a), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense
Amount and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Receiving Party without causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code for the year in
which the Expense Amount would

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise be payable, for this purpose treating such amount as income that
does not qualify for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code, as
determined by the Receiving Partys independent certified public accountants,
plus (B) if the Receiving Party receives either (1) a letter from the
Receiving Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving Party has received a
ruling from the IRS described in Section 6.6(b) or (2) an opinion from the
Receiving Partys counsel as described in Section 6.6(b), an amount equal to
the Expense Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To the
extent the entire Expense Amount is not paid to the Receiving Party in the
year in which such amount would otherwise be payable as a result of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the Expense Amount shall be
carried forward to the succeeding year and shall be payable (as described
above) in such succeeding year by applying the same formula and by deeming
such Expense Amount as payable in such succeeding year. To the extent the full
Expense Amount has not been paid in the initial and succeeding year, the
amount shall similarly be carried forward for each of the next three taxable
years. To the extent that the entire Expense Amount has not been paid in the
initial year, the succeeding year and the three following years, the Expense
Amount shall be forfeited by the Receiving Party. To secure the obligation of
CPA16 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, to pay these amounts, CPA16 or W. P.
Carey, as applicable, shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by CPA16 or W. P. Carey, as
applicable, and on such terms (subject to Section 6.6(b)) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by CPA16 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, the Receiving Party and
the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount
pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) shall be made at the time CPA16 or W. P.
Carey, as applicable, would otherwise be obligated to pay the Receiving Party
pursuant to Section 6.2.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Receiving Party unless the
escrow agent receives any of the following: (i) a letter from the Receiving
Partys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Receiving Party without causing
the payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
that qualifies for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code ("
**Qualifying Income** ") or a subsequent letter from the Receiving Partys
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Receiving Party, or (ii) a letter from the Receiving
Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving Party received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income for purposes of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) (or alternatively, the
Receiving Partys counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount to the Receiving Party.
CPA16 and W. P. Carey each agree to amend this Section 6.6 at the request of
the Receiving Party in order to (A) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount
that may be distributed to the Receiving Party hereunder without causing the
Receiving Party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(c)(3) of the Code, (B) improve the likelihood of the Receiving Party securing
a ruling described in this Section 6.6(b), or (C) assist the Receiving Party
in obtaining a legal opinion from its counsel as described in this Section
6.6(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the
Expense Amount not paid to the Receiving Party in the initial year and the
four succeeding years

 



      
 

 



 

shall be released by the escrow agent to CPA16 or W. P. Carey, as applicable.
Unless such party is the Receiving Party, none of CPA16 or W. P. Carey shall
be a party to such escrow agreement and neither shall bear any cost of or have
liability resulting from the escrow agreement.
