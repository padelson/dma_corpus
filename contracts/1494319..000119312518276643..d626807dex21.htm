last reported sale price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported in
_The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another

4.1(a)(iii)_.

shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), (i)
an aggregate amount of cash, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other
than the Excluded Shares and the Subsidiary-Owned Shares), comprising the
amount of Cash

 Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
required to be delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(i)_ in respect of
Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and the Subsidiary-Owned Shares), (ii)
an aggregate number of uncertificated, book-entry shares of Parent Common
Stock, for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than the Excluded
Shares and the Subsidiary-Owned Shares), comprising the number of shares of
Stock Consideration required to be delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)(i)_ in respect of Shares (other than the Excluded Shares and the

Parent Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ")
and (iii) make available to the Surviving Company, for the benefit of the
holders of the Warrants, cash and shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
make payment of the amounts payable with respect to the Alternative Issuance
(to the extent such amounts are payable). The Paying Agent shall invest the
cash portion of Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ that (A)
such investments shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks and (B) no such investment (or
losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the Cash Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall as
promptly as practicable replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (which confirmation of satisfaction
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the
applicable terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Initial Effective Time (and in
any event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (other than
Excluded Shares and the Subsidiary-Owned Shares) a letter of transmittal (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form with such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify advising such holder of the effectiveness of the
Initial Merger and the conversion of its Shares into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) and for receiving
the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable upon the delivery
of a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section_
__ _ 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the

 



7

    

 Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the number of full shares of Stock Consideration
(which shall be in uncertificated, book-entry form) and the amount of Cash
Consideration (together with any amounts to be paid in respect of any
dividends or other distributions to which holders are entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(i)_), into which the aggregate
number of Shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(i)_ (and in each case, after
giving effect to any required Tax withholding provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_) and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable in connection with the
Mergers, including the Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Initial Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time. From and after the Initial
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights
with respect to Shares formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for one-hundred and
eighty (180) days after the Initial Effective Time shall be delivered, at
Parents option, to Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
who has not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ IV_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any payment of cash
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(f)_) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_), without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Company, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.
To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration shall become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



8

    

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by the Paying Agent or Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration that would have been issuable or payable pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ IV_ (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) had such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts (i) shall, to the extent required by applicable Law, be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. Any applicable Taxes required
to be deducted or withheld shall first reduce the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, and then, only if the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration is insufficient to satisfy such Tax withholdings, the stock
portion of the Merger Consideration.

 

(g) _Uncertificated Shares_. Promptly after the Initial Effective Time (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated Shares (other than
Excluded Shares and Subsidiary-Owned Shares) materials advising such holder of
the effectiveness of the Initial Merger and the conversion of its Shares into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) deliver to each holder
of Uncertificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares and the Subsidiary-Owned
Shares) the number of full shares of Stock Consideration (which shall be
in uncertificated, book-entry form) and the amount of Cash Consideration,
into which the aggregate number of Uncertificated Shares held by each such
holder shall have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(i)_ (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_), without interest thereon.

(h)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged_ _Certificates_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Initial Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled

 



9

    

 to receive upon surrender of such Certificate. Subject to escheat, Tax or
other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(b)_, there shall be paid to such holder
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable as Stock Consideration in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Initial Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Initial
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(i) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip
representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of a Share converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
_multiplied_ _by_ the last reported sale price of Parent Common Stock on the
NYSE (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on
the last complete trading day prior to the date of the Initial Effective
Time. 

(j) _No Further Ownership Rights in_ _the Shares_. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of the Shares (including the
Founder Shares) in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ IV_ shall
be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares (including the Founder Shares).

_4.3_ _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled
to receive cash pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ IV_ unless
and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Initial
Merger under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. If any Person who otherwise would
be deemed a Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to properly perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent under Section
262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall finally
determine that the Dissenting Shareholder is not entitled to relief provided
by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Shares, such Shares shall
thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been converted, as of the
Initial Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without interest and less any required Tax withholding. The Company shall
give Parent (a) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to shareholders
rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to direct all

 



10

    

 negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily offer to make or make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

_4.4 _ _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that either party
changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for any such Shares, in each case issued and outstanding prior to
the Initial Effective Time as a result of a stock distribution,
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar transaction
undertaken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such
event on the Merger Consideration.

_4.5 _ _Treatment of Founder Shares_. At the Initial Effective Time, each
Founder Share and all restrictions in respect thereof, shall, by virtue of the
Initial Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, cease
to exist, and each Founder Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(i)_ in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IV_.

 

 _4.6_ _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The holders of the Warrants issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Initial Effective Time shall, following
the Initial Effective Time, have the right to purchase from the Surviving
Company the Alternative Issuance (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) upon

(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_. At the Initial Effective Time, each

further force or effect, and (ii) if the exercise price of such Company Option

no such Company Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Initial

the right to receive the consideration set forth in this _Section_ __ _
4.7(a)_ in exchange for such Company Options in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.7(a)_. The Cash Consideration payable under

 



11

set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to, and shall be deemed to apply to and
qualify, the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds
in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the
extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure with respect to such other
section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure)
or, as disclosed in any Company Reports filed on or after September 30, 2017
and prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding all disclosures (other than
statements of historical fact) in any "Risk Factors" section and any

assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified

jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to

reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the
date of this Agreement, the Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of the respective certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of the Company and each of its

Merger with the Secretary of the State of Delaware, and no other corporate
action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution,

a meeting is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital
stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers (the "

Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due authorization,

in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity

matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders
of Shares pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Written Consent Parties)
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders and (iii) directed
that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption.
The board of directors of the Company has taken all action so that Parent will
not be an "interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or

_Governmental Entity_ ") in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and/or the consummation by the
Company of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except,

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the

any revised terms proposed by Parent, such Company Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make such Company Change in Recommendation or to so terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) _Company Change in Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(e)_, upon the occurrence of any
Company Intervening Event, the Companys board of directors may, at any time

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ or (y) in the event of a Company
Shareholder Meeting Election following a Support Agreement Failure, the time
the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, make a Company Change
in Recommendation if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Company Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Company Change in Recommendation and (2) state expressly that, subject
to clause (ii) below, the Companys board of directors has determined to
effect a Company Change in Recommendation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (B) prior to making such a Company Change in Recommendation,
engaged in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage)
during such five (5)-Business Day period to negotiate and consider adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that the
failure of the Companys board of directors to make a Company Change in
Recommendation in response to the Company Intervening Event in accordance with
clause (ii) below would no longer reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(ii) the Companys board of directors shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such
Company Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed
by Parent, the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

__ _ 6.2(f)_.

 

 _6.3_ _Parent Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding
any Parent Acquisition Proposal;

to any Parent Acquisition Proposal (a " _Parent Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

Parent shall, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
(A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent
Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (B) promptly (and, in any event, within

release under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or similar agreement;
_provided_ that, prior to the time the Parent Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the foregoing shall not restrict Parent from permitting a Person to
request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from granting
such a waiver, in each case, if the Parents board of directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Parent shall provide written notice to
the Company of any waiver or release of any standstill by Parent, including
the disclosure of the identity of the party thereto and a summary of the
material circumstances related thereto.

 

(b) _Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, prior to, but not
after, the time the Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, Parent may, in
response to an unsolicited, bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal
which Parent Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement
and did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, (i) provide
access to non-public information regarding Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Parent Acquisition Proposal;

Company or is provided to the Company substantially concurrently with the time
such information is made available to such Person and that, prior to
furnishing any such material non-public information, Parent receives from the
Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
Person as the Confidentiality Agreements terms are on the Company, and (ii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal (subject to promptly and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours, notifying the Company of the status and
material details thereof, including providing copies of any documentation that
is material to such Parent Acquisition Proposal) if, and only if, prior to
taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, Parents board of
directors determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that (A) based on the information then available and after
consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation that such Parent Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent
Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) _Notice_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent shall promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify the Company if (i) any
written or other bona fide inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a

6.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit Parent from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Parent

Parties to execute and deliver in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ to the

to cause the Written Consent Parties to duly execute and deliver shareholder
written consents substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "

by each such Written Consent party (which represent more than a majority of
the outstanding Shares) in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL within
twenty-four (24) hours of the Registration Statement becoming effective. As
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of the
Shareholder Written Consent by the Written Consent Parties to the Company, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of such Shareholder Written Consent in

Company Proxy Statement instead of a Consent Solicitation Statement.

of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") to be duly called
and held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)_ during the pendency of any suit by Parent seeking to enforce the

becomes effective, cause a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Parent
Shareholder Meeting_ ") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably
practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval and,
unless a Parent Change in Recommendation shall have occurred, Parent shall use

the definitive Merger Materials to be mailed to their respective shareholders

following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective.
Each party shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates to
the other party and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested by the other party to be included in the Merger Materials and shall
otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other party in the
preparation of the Merger Materials and the resolution of any comments
received from the SEC. If any information relating to the Company or Parent,
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Merger Materials so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such

on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Merger Materials or the Mergers. No response to any comments
from the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the Merger Materials will

review and comment thereon unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by
the SEC.

 

 _6.5_ _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable
Laws and Orders to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
practicable, including (i) preparing and filing all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing
within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement the
notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and as promptly as
practicable in the case of all other filings required under any Foreign
Competition Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby) and to
obtain as expeditiously as practicable, and in any event prior to the

of waiting periods and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the

respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests for
information received from any Governmental Entity, (iii) satisfying the
conditions to consummating the Mergers, (iv) defending any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers, (v) obtaining (and

any exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the
extent necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Mergers and (vi)
executing and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, in the event that the parties receive
a request for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws (a " _Second Request_ "), unless otherwise
agreed to by the Company, the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts to substantially comply with and submit appropriate responses to such
Second Request as promptly as practicable and advisable, and counsel for both
parties will

 



64

    

 closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, as applicable, none of the parties shall knowingly take,
cause, or permit to be taken any action that is reasonably likely to
materially delay or prevent consummation of the contemplated transactions,
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act, as
amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal, state and
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees and other Laws and
Orders that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization, substantial lessening of
competition, or restraint of trade or competition.

(c) Subject to applicable Antitrust Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent shall have the right to devise and direct the strategy for
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the Mergers; _provided_ that such strategy shall be designed to obtain such
clearances as promptly as reasonably practicable and in no event later than
the Termination Date. No party or its counsel shall independently participate
in any meeting or substantive call relating to the Antitrust Laws with
any Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party or its counsel prior notice of such
call or meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) each party shall notify the
other of any filing, communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries
intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are
the subject of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (ii) prior to submitting any such
filing or making any such communication or inquiry, such party shall provide
the other party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any
such proposed filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the
submission of such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide
the other party with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form,
communication or inquiry and (iv) consult with the other party in connection
with any inquiry, hearing, investigation or litigation by, or negotiations
with, any Governmental Entity relating to the Mergers, including the
scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meetings with any Governmental
Entity relating thereto. In exercising the foregoing cooperation rights, the
Company and Parent each shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, materials provided pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ may be reasonably redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Mergers, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (C) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns, or (D) as otherwise required by Law, _provided_
,  _further_ , that any competitively or commercially sensitive material
provided may be designated as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel and
approved outside economic consultants of the recipient and will not be
disclosed to employees, representatives, officers, or directors of the
recipient without written consent of the party providing such materials.

 



65

    

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree,
order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any
suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, "reasonable best efforts" shall include taking any and
all actions necessary to obtain the consents, approvals, permits, waiting
period expirations or authorizations required to consummate the Mergers as
soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the Termination Date, including
but not limited to (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and
agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
divestiture, license, hold separate, sale or other disposition of the
businesses, assets, or products of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) creating, terminating, or amending any
existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent,
the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise taking or
committing to any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any businesses, assets, product
lines or properties of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (each such action in clauses (i)-(iii) a " _Divestiture Action_
"); _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that in no event shall Parent be required to
take or agree or offer to take, and the Company shall not take or agree or
offer to take, any Divestiture Action that meets both of the following
criteria: (A) such Divestiture Action would be of or with respect to
businesses, assets, or products representing, in the aggregate, in excess of
$125,000,000 of annual sales revenues for (x) the fiscal year ended September
30, 2017 in the case of Divestiture Actions with respect to the Company or (y)
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in the case of Divestiture Actions
with respect to Parent and (B) such Divestiture Action would be of or with
respect to more than two (2) existing distribution centers in the aggregate.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be
required to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or
operations in connection with obtaining the approval of any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Mergers unless the effectiveness of such action
or agreement is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

(e) _Information_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_, the Company and Parent
each shall, upon request by the other, promptly furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Merger Materials and any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



66

    

(f) _Status_. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.

 

(g) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in connection with matters set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.5(g)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

_6.6_ _Access; Consultation_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, afford Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Initial Effective Time, to the Companys
and its Subsidiaries employees, properties, assets, books, records and
contracts and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning any of
the foregoing as may reasonably be requested by Parent; _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall require neither the Company
nor Parent to permit any inspection or to disclose any information pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good
faith judgment of such party, any applicable Law requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such party, the
information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or
(iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to
clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, shall (A) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection
or disclosure, (B) use reasonable best efforts develop an alternative to
providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company and (C) in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the
disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the
objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures,
redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to
any information to be so provided, if the parties determine that doing so
would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating
applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege. In no event shall this __

 



67

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ permit either Partys Representatives to conduct
invasive sampling or invasive testing of any environmental media or building
material. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the other party. All requests for information made pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be directed to an executive officer of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, or such Person as may be designated by
any such executive officer.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other
as "Outside Counsel Only Material," "Outside Antitrust Counsel Only Material,"
or with similar restrictions. Such material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient, or
otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement between the parties. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material
subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or
governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a
commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire,
intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not
intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality
of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All such
information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall
remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement,
and under the joint defense doctrine. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or
practices of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could require
remediation under applicable Law and, to the extent identified, shall
cooperate in taking commercially reasonable actions or practices and other
customary actions to reduce the risks related to such actions where the
failure to remediate would reasonably be likely to result in substantial fines
or penalties.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another of
any change, effect, circumstance or development that would reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, Plastics Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect (as applicable), or of any
reasonably likely failure of any condition to Parents or the Companys
obligations to effect the Mergers (as applicable).

 

 _6.7_ _Stock_ _Exchange De-listing and De-registration_. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any other security issued
by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed on the NASDAQ to be de-
listed from the NASDAQ and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
possible following the Initial Effective Time.

 



68

    

_6.8_ _Publicity_. Parent and the Company agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with
each other prior to issuing or making, and provide each other the opportunity
to review and comment on, any press releases or other public announcements
with respect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except (a)
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange, the NASDAQ or the
NYSE, (b) any consultation that would not be reasonably practicable as a
result of requirements of applicable Law, (c) any press release or public
statement that in the good faith judgment of the applicable party is
consistent with prior press releases issued or public statements made in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ (d) with respect to any Company
Change in Recommendation made in accordance with this Agreement or Parents
response thereto, or (e) with respect to any Parent Change in Recommendation
and the Parent Shareholder Meeting and Parent Shareholder Approval following

 _6.9_ _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each Company Employee who continues to remain employed
with the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
shall, during the period commencing at the Initial Effective Time and ending
on the first anniversary of the date on which the Initial Effective Time
occurs (the " _Continuation Period_ "), be provided with (i) a base salary or
base wage that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Initial Effective Time and (ii) target annual cash bonus
opportunities and target long-term incentive compensation opportunities that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus
opportunities and target long-term incentive compensation opportunities
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent agrees that Continuing Employees shall, during the Continuation Period,
be provided with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Additionally, Parent agrees that
each Continuing Employee shall, during the period commencing at the Initial
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Initial Effective
Time, be provided with severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Initial Effective Time. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company
to honor and assume all obligations under the employment agreement and
severance plans listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with the terms of such agreement and plans as in
effect on the date hereof.

 



69

    

(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide that no pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods shall apply to Company
Employees under the benefit plans provided for those employees except to the
extent such condition or exclusion was applicable to an individual Company
Employee prior to the Initial Effective Time. With respect to the plan year
during which the Initial Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide each
Company Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket requirements
paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent plan in which such Company
Employee is eligible to participate following the Closing Date.

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, provide credit (without duplication) to Company Employees for
their service recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Initial
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous service,
determination of service awards, vacation, paid time off, and
severance entitlements to the same extent and for the same purposes as such
service was credited under the Company Plans, _provided_ that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Employee who
is, or becomes, subject to a CBA, all compensation and benefits treatment and
terms and conditions of employment afforded to such Company Employee shall be
provided in accordance with such CBA or other agreement with a labor union or
like organization and the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall not apply.

(e) From and after the Initial Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) shall honor all
Company Plans in accordance with their terms (including any rights to amend,
modify or terminate such Company Plans) as in effect immediately prior to the
Initial Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this
Agreement shall limit the ability of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to provide compensation and
benefits to Continuing Employees in accordance with this Agreement through
plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries after the Initial Effective Time.

(f) Each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is
employed for any portion of the Fiscal Year commencing October 1, 2018 and
who participates in an annual bonus program of the Company (each, a " _Bonus
Eligible Employee_ ") shall be eligible to receive a pro rata portion of
such individuals annual bonus with respect to the "stub" period between
September 30, 2018 and the Closing Date, based on actual results as of the
Closing (the " _Pro Rata Bonus_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
applicable performance criteria may

 



70

    

 be equitably adjusted by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board
of Directors to the extent that the Compensation Committee determines that any
such adjustment is in the best interests of the Company consistent with its
fiduciary duties, taking into account the consummation of the Mergers and the
anticipated Closing, in each case relating to the Merger and only to the
extent not taken into account in establishing the applicable performance
goals; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall consult in
good faith with Parent reasonably in advance of making any such adjustments
and the Company shall consider Parents input in good faith prior to making
such adjustments. Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Pro Rata
Bonus shall be payable at such time as the Company pays annual bonuses to its
employees in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.
Each Bonus Eligible Employee who experiences a termination of employment,
other than for "Cause" (as defined in the Companys Severance Plan for U.S.
Officers and Executives, amended and restated, effective as of June 9, 2016),
prior to the payment of the Pro Rata Bonus shall be entitled to receive the
Pro Rata Bonus, if any, payable as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date on which the employment termination occurs; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that this provision shall not apply to the extent that an employee has the
right to receive a pro-rated bonus for the year in which employment
termination occurs under a Company Plan. The Company shall consult in good
faith with Parent regarding (1) the applicable performance goals for the
Companys 2019 Fiscal Year (including applicable goals for any abbreviated
periods during such time) and (2) the determination of the Pro Rata Bonus
payout levels.

(g) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and neither any union nor any current or
former employee, nor any other individual associated therewith, is or shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement
(except to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.8(d)_). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to,
any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent
to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party any right to
enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, (iv) prevent Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Initial Effective
Time, from terminating the employment of any Company Employee or (v) be
deemed to confer upon any such individual or legal representative any rights
under or with respect to any plan, program or arrangement described in or
contemplated by this Agreement, and each such individual or legal
representative shall be entitled to look only to the express terms of any such
plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights thereunder.

 

(h) If, at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Initial Effective
Time, Parent provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to
terminate its 401(k) plan(s) and/or its excess benefit plan, the Company shall
terminate any and all 401(k) plans and/or the excess benefit plan effective as
of the day immediately preceding the day on which the 

 



71

    

 Initial Effective Time occurs (the " _Plan Termination Date_ "). In the
event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) and the excess benefit
plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that such 401(k) plan(s) and the excess benefit plan
have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Companys Board of
Directors at least two (2) Business Days prior to the day on which the
Initial Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that prior to terminating the
Companys 401(k) plan or the excess benefit plan, the Company shall provide
Parent with the form and substance of any applicable resolutions for review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). If the Company 401(k) plan or the excess benefit plan is
terminated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(h)_, then as soon
as practicable following the Plan Termination Date, Parent shall permit all
Continuing Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k)
plan or the excess benefit plan immediately prior to the Plan Termination Date
to participate in Parents 401(k) plan or Parents excess benefit plan, as
applicable, and shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to
transfer his or her account balance when distributed from the terminated
Company 401(k) plan, including any outstanding participant loans, to Parents
401(k) plan, except to the extent that accepting such transfers would
adversely affect the tax-qualified status of Parents 401(k) plan or as may
be prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

_6.10_ _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in  _Sections_ __ _ 6.5_ and
_8.5_ , whether or not the Mergers are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the
filing fee for the Merger Materials and printing and mailing the Merger
Materials shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.

 

 _6.11_ _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Initial Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company determined as of the Initial
Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Initial Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of the fact that
such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another Person prior to the Initial Effective
Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Initial Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under Delaware Law, any applicable indemnification agreement
to which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this

 



72

    

 Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent and the Surviving Company
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
shall provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent shall
ensure that the organizational documents of the Surviving Company shall, for
a period of six (6) years from and after the Initial Effective Time, contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees
and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws. Any right of
indemnification of an Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.11_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Party as
provided herein.

 

(b) Prior to the Initial Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Initial
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Initial Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at least substantially as
favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Initial Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of three-hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for the
DandO Insurance; and,  _provided_ , _further_ that if the premium for the DandO
Insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
shall assume all of the obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.11_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be in addition to any rights such
individual may have under Delaware Law, any applicable indemnification
agreement to which such Person is a party, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws.

 



73

    

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

 _6.12_ _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and its board of directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise use reasonable best efforts to act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 

 _6.13_ _Control of the Company_ __ _s or Parent_ __ _s Operations_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to
the Initial Effective Time. Prior to the Initial Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its
operations.

_6.14 _ _Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. The board of directors of each of the Company
and Parent (or, in each case, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall,
prior to the Initial Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual, including by deputization, who is a
director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 _6.15_ _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent will use reasonable best efforts to obtain Financing (or in the
event any portion or all of the Committed Financing becomes unavailable
(after giving effect to any other financing that may then be available to
cover such unavailable amount) and such amount is necessary to pay the Merger
Amounts, alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, together with
the remaining Financing, if any, and any other sources available to Parent,
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II, to fund the payment of the Merger Amounts)
from the same or other sources (any such alternative debt financing that
Parent obtains if any portion or all of the Committed Financing becomes
unavailable, a " _Replacement Financing_ ")) required to fund the payment of
the Merger Amounts on the Closing Date. It is understood and agreed that in no
event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require Parent to pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (or the related fee

 



74

    

 letter) (including market flex provisions set forth therein) as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, or agree to any market flex provision less
favorable to Parent than the market flex provisions contained in the fee
letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement (in either case, whether to
secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise). Upon request
by the Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of,
or receiving written notice with respect to, any material breach of or
default under, or any event or circumstance that (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach of or default under, the Commitment Letter by a party thereto
or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of the Commitment Letter.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent,
Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither
the availability nor terms of the Financing are conditions to the obligations
of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II to consummate the Mergers, and each
of Parent, Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement subject only to the express conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_, irrespective and independent of the availability or terms of the
Financing.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement (other than _Section_ __ _ 5.2(k)_), the
term " _Financing_ " shall mean (i) the Committed Financing, (ii) any
Replacement Financing, (iii) any Bond Financing and (iv) any other financing
arrangement arranged by Parent to fund the Merger Amounts.

 

(c) The Company shall furnish Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable
with (A) the financial information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph 2 of Annex C of the Commitment
Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) and (B) all financial and related
information reasonably requested in writing by Parent that relates to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and is necessary to permit Parent to prepare a
pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma financial
statements, in each case as required pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph 2
of Annex C of the Commitment Letter; it being understood and agreed that the
preparation of such pro forma consolidated balance sheet and related pro forma
financial statements is the responsibility of Parent, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have no responsibility for, and make no representations
regarding, the resultant pro forma information. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, use reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Committed Financing and/or any
Replacement Financing, which reasonable best efforts shall include:

(i) furnishing Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable with such
pertinent information relating to the business, financial performance or
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be necessary to
prepare the marketing and rating agency materials described in clause (ii)(B)
below;

 



75

    

(ii) (A) participating in a reasonable number of presentations, meetings
(including with prospective lenders and investors) and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Committed Financing and/or any Replacement
Financing, in each case, at reasonable times and locations to be mutually
agreed, and (B) assisting with the preparation of customary materials for
rating agency presentations, a bank information memorandum (including, to the
extent necessary, a supplement thereto that does not include material non-
public information) and similar documents required in connection with the
Committed Financing and/or any Replacement Financing;

(iii) assisting reasonably in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, one or more definitive financing documents (including one or more
credit agreements, and/or other instruments) in connection with the Committed
Financing and/or any Replacement Financing, as well as any pledge and
security documents, and other collateral filings or other certificates or
documents as may reasonably be requested by Parent and reasonably facilitating
the taking of all corporate actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to entering such definitive financing documents and otherwise

be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein"

All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that

which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,

that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any
such breach or that the Company or Parent otherwise have an adequate remedy at
law.

Financing Parties

implied in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in
