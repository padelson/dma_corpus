discharge to the Buyer of all liability to make payment of entitlements of
the Seller to any amount of the UK Earn Out Figure and (as the case
may require) any amount of the UK Retention.

    | 6.4.2.  |   |

their delivery (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing between the
Buyer and the Seller) (the "Review Period"), the Seller and the Buyer shall
review the draft Completion Accounts and endeavour to agree by negotiation
what adjustments (if any) need to be made to them in order for them to comply
with clause 6.4. If the Seller or the Buyer dispute the preparation of the
Completion Accounts and the computation of the NAV he or it shall within the
Review Period promptly give written notice to the other of the facts
and matters in dispute together with details of the grounds on which such
matter is disputed. If:

the draft Completion Accounts; or

    | 6.5.2.2.  |   |

confirm in writing that they have carried out such work as they consider
necessary under clause 6.4 and that in their opinion the Completion Accounts
have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of clause 6.5 and comply
with those provisions; and

  
      
    | 6.5.2.3.  |   |

confirm in writing the amount of the NAV on the basis of those Completion
Accounts;

  
   

   

and the Completion Accounts and the amount of the NAV as so confirmed
in writing shall be the Completion Accounts and the NAV respectively for
the purpose of calculating the sum (if any) due under clause 6.1, shall in
the absence of manifest error be final and binding on the parties and shall
not be subject to question on any ground and 

   ##### 

  

    

the date of that written confirmation shall for all purposes of
this agreement be the date of determination of the NAV. 

  

       | 6.6.  |   |

If the Seller and the Buyer have not resolved any matter(s) in dispute and
have not provided the written confirmations referred to in clause 6.5.2
within the Review Period, then the relevant matter(s) shall be in dispute
between the Seller and the Buyer and shall immediately be referred to such
firm of independent chartered accountants as the Seller and the Buyer may
agree within 15 business days of a request by either of them to the other
or, failing agreement within that time, as the President for the time being
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (or any person
for the time being performing the functions of that official) may nominate on
the application of the Seller or the Buyer (the "Independent Accountants")
for determination on the following basis:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 6.6.1.  |   |

the Independent Accountants shall be instructed to notify the Seller and
the Buyer of their determination of any such matter within 30 business days
of that referral (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing between
the Buyer and the Seller);

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.6.2.  |   |

the Seller and the Buyer may make written submissions to the
Independent Accountants, but subject to those rights the Independent
Accountants shall have power to determine the procedure to be followed in
relation to their determination;

  
      
    | 6.6.3.  |   |

in making any such submissions the Seller and the Buyer shall state
their respective best estimates of any monetary amounts referred for
determination;

  
      
    | 6.6.4.  |   |

in making their determination the Independent Accountants shall act as
experts and not as arbitrators, their decisions as to any matter referred to
them for determination shall in the absence of manifest error be final and
binding on the parties and shall not be subject to question on any ground;
and

  
      
    | 6.6.5.  |   |

the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne and
paid as the Independent Accountants shall direct (or in the absence of any
such direction, as to half by the Seller and as to half by the Buyer).

  
   

  

       | 6.7.  |   |

Following any agreement between the Seller and the Buyer in accordance with
clause 6.6 or any determination by the Independent Accountants in accordance
with clause 6.7, the parties shall:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 6.7.1.  |   |

jointly incorporate into and reflect in the draft Completion Accounts
the matters agreed between the Seller and the Buyer and/ or determined by
the Independent Accountants; and

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.7.2.  |   |

provide written confirmation of those adjusted accounts in the terms set out
in paragraphs 6.5.2.2 and 6.5.2.3 of clause 6.5;

  
   

   

and the Completion Accounts and the amount of the NAV as so confirmed in
writing shall be the Completion Accounts and the NAV respectively for the
purpose of calculating the sum (if any) due under clause 6.1, shall in the
absence of manifest error be final and binding on the parties and shall not
be subject to question on any ground and the date of that written
confirmation 

   ##### 

  

    

shall for all purposes of this agreement be the date of determination of the
NAV. 

  

       | 6.8.  |   |

Until the NAV shall have been agreed or determined the Seller and the Buyer
shall respectively:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 6.8.1.  |   |

give or procure that the Seller or the Buyer and the Independent
Accountants (as the case may require) are given access at all reasonable
times on prior appointment during normal working hours on business days to
all relevant books and records which are in the possession or under the
control of the Seller, the Company or the Buyer (as the case may be); and

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.8.2.  |   |

generally provide the Seller or the Buyer and the Independent Accountants
(as the case may require) with such other information and assistance as they
may reasonably require (including access to and assistance at reasonable
times on prior appointment during normal working hours on business days from
personnel employed by the Seller, the Company or the Buyer, as the case may
be), in relation to the review, agreement or determination of the Completion
Accounts and the determination of the NAV.

  
   

  

       | 6.9.  |   |

The fees and expenses of the auditors in respect of the preparation of the
Completion Accounts as provided in clause 6.3 shall be borne equally by the
Buyer and the Seller who shall indemnify each other accordingly and the cost
to be borne by the Seller shall be satisfied by being provided in the
Completion Accounts.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.10.  |   |

The Buyer and the Seller shall execute any documents (including any terms
of engagement or limitations on liability), provide any information and take
any steps which, in each case, may reasonably be required by the Auditors or,
as the case may be, the Independent Accountants in order to enable them to
complete the work required of them by this clause 6.

  
      
    | 6.11.  |   |

Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the Buyer or the Seller from
obtaining, at their own expense, professional advice in relation to any
matter arising in connection with the agreement or determination of the
Completion Accounts and the NAV.

  
      
    | 6.12.  |   |

The preparation of the Completion Accounts and the agreement and/or
determination of the NAV shall be without prejudice to any claim which the
Buyer might have against the Seller under or in respect of this agreement
and/or the Tax Covenant but the Seller shall not be liable more than once in
respect of the same loss.

hold the Sale Shares and the dividends and other distributions of profits
or surplus or other assets declared, paid or made in respect of them after

the purpose of receiving notices of and attending and voting at all meetings
of the members of the Company from Completion to the day on which the Buyer

---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 8.2.1.  |   |

the Company to send any notices or other communications in respect of his
holding of Sale Shares to the Buyer; and

  ##### 

  

   

       | 8.6.  |   |

In consideration of the Buyer entering into this agreement the Seller warrants
to the Buyer:

(subject to clause 9.3) in the terms set out in schedule 4;

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.1.2.  |   |

that any statement in schedule 4 which is qualified as being made "so far

enquiries by the Seller (including enquiry of the executive directors and
company secretary, of the Company and the accountants, solicitors, patent

material respects;

  
   

  

       | 9.2  |   |

The Seller shall indemnify the Buyer against any loss, claim, demand or

every breach of Warranty. 

  

       | 9.6  |   |

of fraud, deceit or other dishonesty, or intentional misstatement or
intentional omission.

agents or advisers to the Seller or its agents or advisers of any information
or opinion in connection with the Warranties or the Agreed Documents or

connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Agreed Documents shall
not be deemed a representation, warranty or guarantee to any party of the
accuracy of any such information or opinion;

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.8.2  |   |

to waive any right or claim which he may have against the Company and/ or any
of its directors, employees agents or advisers for any error, omission or
misrepresentation in any such information or opinion; and

  
      
    | 9.8.3  |   |

that any such right or claim shall not constitute a defence to any claim by
the Buyer under or in relation to the Agreed Documents (including the
Warranties).

  
   

  

       | 9.9  |   |

Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, except in the case of
a fraudulent misrepresentation, the Seller shall not in relation to the sale
hereunder of the Sale Shares or this agreement be liable in respect of any
representations or warranties or similar assurances which are not contained
and expressly given or assumed by him in this agreement or the Disclosure
Letter or any other Agreed Document.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.10  |   |

If the effect of a breach of Warranty is that:-

  
   

  

       | 9.10.1  |   |

any asset of the Company is extinguished or is worth less than its
value would have been if the breach of Warranty had not occurred; or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.10.2  |   |

the Company is or will be under a liability or an increased or
substituted liability which would not have existed if the breach of Warranty
had not occurred;

  
   

   

the Buyer may by notice in writing given to the Seller at any time
after Completion require the Seller to make good the resultant loss suffered
or incurred by the Buyer or the Company either (at the Buyers option) by 

  

       | (a)  |   |

the payment in cash to the Buyer of an amount equal to the amount by which in
consequence of the breach of Warranty the value of the Sale Shares falls
short of the value they would have had if the breach of Warranty had not
occurred; or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   |

the payment in cash to the Buyer of the amount provided in clause 9.11.

  
   

  

       | 9.11  |   |

The amount referred to in clause 9.10(b) in relation to the alternative
measure of damages is:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 9.11.1  |   |

if the effect of the breach of Warranty is as stated in clause 9.10.1,
the amount by which the value of the assets of the Company falls short of

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   |

the value they would have had if the breach of Warranty had not occurred; or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.11.2  |   |

if the effect of the breach of Warranty is as stated in clause 9.10.2,
the amount by which the liabilities of the Company exceed what would have
been their amount if the breach of Warranty had not occurred;

  
   

  

       | 9.12  |   |

The amount of the loss suffered by the Buyer in consequence of any breach
of Warranty as measured by any of the payments which the Buyer is entitled to
require to be made under clause 9.11 shall be deemed to have been within the
contemplation of the parties on entering into this agreement.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 9.13  |   |

The rights and remedies of the Buyer in respect of any breach of the
Warranties shall not be affected or limited, and the amount recoverable shall
not be reduced, by any investigation made by it or on its behalf into the
affairs of the Company SAVE THAT if such investigation gives the Buyer (in
the persons only of John Gruber, Paul Henry, Bryan Boettger, Mark Cassens,
Michael Wons, and Guy Wernet) actual knowledge of the relevant facts and
circumstances giving rise to any claim under the Warranties then to that
extent the Buyer shall not be entitled to make recovery. For the avoidance
of doubt such rights remedies and the amounts recoverable shall not be
affected or limited on the grounds that the Buyer may have had constructive
imputed or implied knowledge of the matter giving rise to the claim.

or other securities or the purchase of assets or services or otherwise) for
the payment of, or as an indemnity against the consequence of default in the

can demonstrate was not taken into account in computing the liability of the
Seller in respect of that Warranty Claim and would have reduced that
liability had it been taken into account, then unless payment of that benefit
or refund has already been made by the Buyer to the Seller under paragraph 4
of this schedule 5, the Buyer shall forthwith repay to the Seller a sum
corresponding to that benefit or refund as the case may be.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 4.2.  |   |

Nothing contained in this agreement shall have the effect of relieving the
Buyer or the Company from any common law duty to mitigate any loss or
damage suffered by it.

  
      
    | 4.3.  |   |

The Seller shall not be liable more than once in respect of any loss, damage
or liability, whether by reason of a Warranty Claim, an Indemnity Claim
or also a Covenant Claim being made or otherwise, so that any amount paid
under the Warranties shall reduce the amount otherwise payable under the Tax
Covenant or the covenants to pay in clause 13 of this agreement in respect of
the same matter by that amount and vice versa..

Time Limits

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 5.1.  |   |

No Claim shall be brought by the Buyer or the Company unless notice
in writing of that Claim (specifying in reasonable detail with supporting
evidence the event, matter or default which gave rise to the Claim and an
estimate of the amount claimed) has been given to the Seller:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   ##### 

  

  

       | 5.1.1.  |   |

in the case of a Covenant Claim or a Warranty Claim under any of the Tax
Warranties, within seven years after Completion; or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 5.1.2.  |   |

in the case of an IP Claim or an Indemnity Claim, within six years after
Completion;

  
      
    | 5.1.3.  |   |

in any other case, within 18 months after Completion.

  
   

  

       | 5.2.  |   |

Any such Claim which has been made shall (if it has not been
previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) be deemed to have been waived or
withdrawn 12 months after the date it was made unless court proceedings in
respect of it have then been commenced against the Seller, or the Seller and
the Buyer have agreed in writing to extend that 12 month period, in which
case this paragraph 5.2 shall apply to that Claim with the substitution of
that extended period (and for this purpose court proceedings shall not be
deemed to have been commenced unless they have been both issued and served on
the Seller).

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 5.3.  |   |

Nothing in this schedule 5 shall prevent the Buyer from amending
or amplifying any Claim at any time after its initial notification in
accordance with this paragraph 5 in the light of further information obtained
or received by or on behalf of the Buyer.

Conduct of Claims by and Recovery from Third Parties

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 6.1.  |   |

This paragraph 6 does not apply to regulate the conduct of Claims in relation
to Tax but it applies to regulate the conduct of all other Claims as set out
below. All Claims or potential Claims in relation to Tax (whether under
the Tax Warranties or otherwise) shall be conducted in accordance with
paragraph 11 of the Tax Covenant. For the purposes of this paragraph 6 an
"Opinion" shall mean opinion of a leading counsel agreed upon by the Seller
and the Buyer or (in the absence of such agreement) the opinion of counsel of
not less than 10 years standing nominated on the application of the Seller by
the Chairman of the Bar Council or failing such nomination by the President
of the Law Society has been obtained by the Seller to the effect that (i) in
respect of a Relevant Third Party Claim, such Claim will on the balance of
probabilities be successfully defended by the relevant member of the Buyers
Group (as enlarged by the acquisition of the Company) and that the action
requested by the Seller is appropriate or (ii) where the Seller is requesting
the Buyer to pursue a Third Party Recovery Right that the Third Party
Recovery Right will, on the balance of probabilities be successfully pursued.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.2.  |   |

In relation to Relevant Third Party IP Claims and Third Party IP Recovery
Rights:-

  
   

  

       | 6.2.1.  |   |

the Buyer shall notify the Seller in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of any Relevant Third Party IP Claim and/or
Third Party IP Recovery Right;

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.2.2.  |   |

the Seller and the Buyer shall in good faith co-operate with each other in
relation to the Relevant Third Party IP Claim with a view to any possible
mitigating defence or other commercially acceptable action to minimise the
risk of

  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   |

litigation. For the avoidance of doubt the Buyer shall be entitled (and from
time to time) to seek counsels opinion on any matter the subject of the
Relevant Third Party IP Claim or Third Party IP Recovery Right and the Seller
shall procure that the Buyer has sufficient information to prepare full
detailed and accurate instructions to counsel to advise within the timescale
required by the Buyer (acting reasonably);

  
---|---|---|--- 
     
       | 6.2.3.  |   |

the Seller shall not be entitled to require the Company or the Buyer to
initiate proceedings or himself initiate proceedings before any court,
tribunal or other competent body under any powers of delegation conferred by
this paragraph 6.2;

  
      
    | 6.2.4.  |   |

subject to the Seller indemnifying and securing (and keeping indemnified and
secured including but without limitation by recourse to the Total Retention)
the Buyer and the Company to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer the
Buyer shall take and procure that the Company takes in relation to any
Relevant Third Party IP Claim or Third Party IP Recovery Right such action as
the Seller may reasonably require in relation thereto:-

  
   

  

       | 6.2.4.1.  |   |

to avoid, resist, mitigate, compromise, defend or appeal against any Relevant
Third Party IP Claim; or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.2.4.2.  |   |

to enforce any Relevant Third Party IP Recovery Right;

  
   

   

and the Buyer shall not (and shall procure that the Company shall not)
in relation to any IP Claim accept pay or compromise any Relevant Third
Party IP Claim or Third Party IP Recovery Right without the prior agreement
of the Seller which he shall not unreasonably withhold or delay or
grant subject to unreasonable conditions. 

  

       | 6.2.5.  |   |

on the written request of the Seller the conduct of any legal proceedings
arising out of any Relevant Third Party IP Claim ("Proceedings") shall be
delegated to the Seller and for this purpose the Buyer shall and shall
procure that the Company shall give all such assistance as the Seller may
reasonably require and shall appoint such lawyers and professional advisers
as the Seller (acting reasonably) may nominate to act on behalf of the Buyer
or the Company in accordance with the Sellers instructions.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.2.6.  |   |

the rights given to the Seller under paragraphs 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 above are
subject to and conditional upon the following:-

  
   

  

       | 6.2.6.1.  |   |

unless an Opinion has been obtained the Buyer shall not be bound by
paragraphs 6.2.4 and/or 6.2.5 (as the case may be) above to the extent that
it is of the reasonable opinion (on the basis of facts and matters explained
to the Seller) that the probable consequence of any

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   |

such requirements or actions would adversely affect the conduct of the
business of any member of the Buyers Group to a material extent PROVIDED
ALWAYS that the Buyer shall not be obliged to take any form of action
involving a customer of or a licensor to the Company or any other member of
the Buyers Group;

  
---|---|---|--- 
     
       | 6.2.6.2.  |   |

the Seller must keep the Buyer fully and promptly informed of (a) all
communications and interactions concerning the Relevant Third Party IP Claim
or Third Party IP Recovery Right and/or (b) the Proceedings (as the case may
be), shall provide the Buyer with copies of all material correspondence and
documentation relating to the Relevant Third Party IP Claim and/or Third
Party IP Recovery Right, shall consult the Buyer on any matter which is
likely to be material in relation to any of them and shall take account of
all reasonable requirements of the Buyer in relation to any of them and shall
comply fully with the standard policies and procedures from time to
time applying to members of the Buyers Group to the extent that they are
not inconsistent with the other provisions of this paragraph 6;

  
      
    | 6.2.6.3.  |   |

the Seller must not make any settlement or compromise of the Relevant Third
Party IP Claim or Third Party IP Recovery Right, whether the subject of
Proceedings or not, or agree to any matter in the conduct thereof which
may affect the amount of the liability in connection with such Relevant
Third Party IP Claim or the amount of the Third Party IP Recovery Right
without the prior approval of the Buyer, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld.

  
      
    | 6.2.6.4.  |   |

in the event of the Buyer acting unreasonably in refusing approval of such
settlement or compromise, the Seller shall have no liability in respect of
any Claim arising therefrom in excess of the figure at which they could have
settled or compromised the Relevant Third Party IP Claim or Third Party IP
Recovery Right and the Buyer shall be liable for any costs incurred since the
proposed date of settlement or compromise.

  
   

  

       | 6.3.  |   |

Without prejudice to the foregoing the Seller shall cease to be entitled to
exercise any of the rights under paragraphs 6.2.4 and/or 6.2.5 and to have
the conduct of the Proceedings in circumstances where:-

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | 6.3.1.  |   |

aggregate professional costs (including legal and accountancy fees and the
fees of patent agents and other experts) reach US $750,000 ;or

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.3.2.  |   |

the Seller ceases to be employed by or contracted under a contract for
services to the Company or any other member of the Buyers Group (which the
parties will negotiate in good faith) by reason of termination for misconduct
or otherwise for cause by the Company or such member or by reason of his
voluntary resignation or his voluntary termination.

  
   

  

       | 6.4.  |   |

Without limitation to and subject always to paragraph 6.2 the Buyer:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | 6.4.1.  |   |

shall notify the Seller in writing as soon as reasonably practicable upon
becoming aware of any Relevant Third Party Claim and/or Third Party Recovery
Right. Failure to give such notice or any delay in so doing shall not prevent
the Buyer from making a valid Claim. The Buyer (a) shall in relation to a
Third Party Claim consult with the Seller with respect to any
possible mitigating action or defence to the Relevant Third Party Claim
or any possible Third Party Recovery Right in relation to the Relevant Third
Party Claim and (b) shall in relation to any Third Party Recovery Right
consult with the Seller with respect to exercising or otherwise securing the
benefit of such Third Party Recovery Right and shall in each case take fully
into account the reasonable representations of the Seller in relation to the
appropriate action to take provided that:

  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   |

such representations are provided without unreasonable delay and in any event
sufficiently ahead of any relevant time limits notified to the Seller as to
enable the requested action still to be capable of being taken; and

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   |

such representations do not involve action which would have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Buyer or any member of the Buyers
Group (as enlarged by the acquisition of the Company);

  
   

  

       | 6.4.2.  |   |

has the right to require the Seller to indemnify and secure the Buyer and the
Company to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer in relation to any action
taken by them as a result of the representations of the Seller. The conduct
of the Relevant Third Party Claim or a claim or potential claim relating to
the Third Party Recovery Right (any such Relevant Third Party Claim or
a claim or potential claim relating to the Third Party Recovery Right being
referred to as a "Potential Claim") shall, however, be controlled by the
Buyer;

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.4.3.  |   |

shall be obliged to comply with the representations of the Seller where
provisos (a) and (b) of paragraph 6.4.1 above are satisfied or, in a case
where proviso (b) is not satisfied an Opinion has been obtained , including
to the effect that the action requested by the Seller is appropriate

  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   |

PROVIDED ALWAYS that the Buyer shall not be obliged to take any form of
action involving a customer of or a licensor to the Company or any other
member of the Buyers Group;

  
---|---|---|--- 
     
       | 6.4.4.  |   |

shall ensure that the Seller is kept promptly and properly informed of any
actual or proposed developments in the Potential Claim which are or may
reasonably be considered to be material, including providing the Seller with
copies of all material correspondence and documentation relating to the
Potential Claim and the Seller shall provide to the Buyer such assistance as
the Buyer reasonably requests in relation to the conduct of such Potential
Claim;

  
   

  

       | 6.5.  |   |

If any sum is recovered by the Buyer or the Company from a third party under
a Third Party Recovery Right, any Claim (other than under the Tax
Covenant) in respect of any loss, damage or liability to which that sum
relates shall be reduced (without prejudice to any other limitations on the
liability of the Seller referred to in this schedule 5) by the amount of the
sum recovered from the third party after deducting from it all reasonable
costs, charges and expenses incurred and not recovered by the Buyer, any
member of the Buyers Group or the Company (as the case may be) in recovering
that sum from the third party.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 6.6.  |   |

If the Seller has paid an amount in respect of a relevant Claim (other than
under the Tax Covenant) which exceeds the amount of that Claim as reduced
by paragraph 6.5 above, the Buyer shall forthwith repay to the Seller the
amount of the excess.

  
   

  

     7  |   |

Successful Claims Deemed to Constitute a Reduction in Consideration

  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   |

The satisfaction by the Seller of any Claim shall be deemed to constitute an
equivalent reduction in the Consideration payable by the Buyer for the sale
of the Sale Shares.

  
      
  8  |   |

Tax Warranties

  
      
    |   |

The provisions of paragraph 2 of the Tax Covenant shall apply to limit the
liability of the Seller under the Tax Warranties as if the matter, liability
or thing that would otherwise give rise to that liability were a Tax
Liability as defined in the Tax Covenant.

to enforce that recovery PROVIDED THAT the Buyer shall not be required to
take any action pursuant to this paragraph 5 (other than an action against
a Tax Authority or a person who has given Tax advice to the Company on or

the commercial relationship (potential or actual) of the Buyer or any member
of the Buyers Group or the Company with that or any other person.

payment of the amount £1,680,000 (being the Istenes Sum inclusive of the
related UK Retention) is deductible in computing corporation tax of the
