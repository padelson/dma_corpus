after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Bylaws"),
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the

in accordance with the DGCL, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "VISX, Incorporated."   Section 1.6
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.   (a) The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the

appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.   (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall

Company which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than the delivery of items to be delivered at Closing and other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Closing) or on such other date and such other time and place as Parent
and the Company shall agree. The date on which the Closing shall occur is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."   ARTICLE II   CONVERSION
AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES   Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock.   At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or
any capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Company Common Stock. Subject to this
Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares referred to in Section
2.3), together with each associated "Right" (as defined in the Rights
Agreement, dated as of August 3, 2000, between the Company and Fleet National
Bank, as rights agent, as amended through the date hereof (the "Company
Rights Agreement")), shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.552
(the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Parent Common Stock") of Parent (the "Stock Merger Consideration") and (ii)
$3.50 in cash without interest (the "Cash Merger Consideration" and, together
with the Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). From
and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), any cash
in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled to pursuant
to Section 2.2(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or
other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock occurring (or having a record date) after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time.   3    EXECUTION COPY   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All shares of Company
Common Stock, together with each associated Right, that are (i) held by the
Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned
Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent, in each case immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means,
with respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner, manager or managing member,
(B) such party or any Subsidiary of such party owns in excess of a majority
of the outstanding equity or voting securities or interests or (C) such party
or any Subsidiary of such party has the right to elect at least a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization.   (c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger
Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) Stock Options; Deferred Phantom Stock. Outstanding
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and outstanding deferral
accounts under the 1995 Director Plan (each, a "Phantom Unit Account") shall
be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.10.   Section 2.2 Exchange
of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder
(the "Exchange Agent"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, stock certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and an amount of cash
sufficient to deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than the
Dissenting Shares) the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section
2.2(d) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c) (such certificates for shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or other distributions being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) Exchange Procedures. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares   4    EXECUTION COPY  of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify that are not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive (A) certificates evidencing the
Stock Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) the Cash Merger Consideration
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, (C) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and (D) any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), after giving effect to any tax withholdings required by
applicable Law, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company
as of the Effective Time, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate evidencing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Common Stock will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(d), unless and until the
holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the
effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
in addition to the Merger Consideration deliverable therefore pursuant to
Section 2.1, without interest, (A) the amount of any cash payable with
respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, with   5    EXECUTION
COPY  a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.   (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificate
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the last reported sales price of Parent
Common Stock at the end of regular trading hours on the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on the Closing Date (the "Parent Closing
Price").   (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be
a condition to the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or will
have established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) Termination of
Exchange Fund; No Liability. At any time following the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to

to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) with
respect to the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to
such holders pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be liable to any
holder of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be,
for such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law following the passage of time specified
therein.   (g) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person
who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are   6    EXECUTION COPY  so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent.   (h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after
such time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.   (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock as may be required pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) as well as the other Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c); provided, however, that
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver an agreement of indemnification in form satisfactory to Parent, or a
bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section
2.3 Dissenting Stockholders.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder thereof who properly
exercises and perfects appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will be paid for by the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; provided,
however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL,
the right of such holder to such appraisal of its shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to which any such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and any dividends or other distributions to which
any such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The Company shall
give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal received
by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
related instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received
by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisals under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, (i)
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for   7   
EXECUTION COPY  appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle, or
settle, any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL, or (iv) agree to do any of
the foregoing.   Section 2.4 Alternative Merger Consideration.  
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
the Tax Opinion condition set forth in Section 7.1(g) would not otherwise be
satisfied with respect to the Merger, the amount of the aggregate Cash Merger
Consideration shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary and, subject
to the following sentence, the aggregate Stock Merger Consideration shall be
increased to the minimum extent necessary, to enable the Tax Opinion or Tax
Opinions, as the case may be, to be rendered. For purposes of determining the
number of additional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
to stockholders of the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Exchange Ratio shall be increased by an amount equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the amount of the reduction in the Cash Merger Consideration
by (B) the Parent Closing Price, provided, however, absent a change in law,
solely for purposes of determining whether counsel may render the Tax Opinion
or Tax Opinions, the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
determined by using the average of the high and low trading price of the
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the Closing Date.   Section 2.5 Material

of general market, economic or political conditions (including any changes
arising out of acts of terrorism, or war, weather conditions or other force
majeure events), provided that such changes do not have a substantially
disproportionate impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
any changes resulting from or arising out of general market, economic or
political conditions in the industries in which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries conduct business (including any changes arising out of acts of

provided that such changes do not have a substantially disproportionate
impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) any changes

relating to employee benefits matters, (vi) all personnel, payroll and

with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the regulations
thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the Company, the
Company\'s Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have in all
material respects met their obligations with respect to each Company Employee
Plan and have timely made (or timely will make) all required contributions
thereto. All filings and reports as to each Company Employee Plan required to
have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States
Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Company
Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the Company\'s
Knowledge, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection
with which the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
plan participant could be subject to any material liability (including
penalties or taxes) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law, nor
will the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement give rise to any such material liability.   (d) With respect to
the Company Employee Plans, there are no material benefit obligations for
which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are no
benefit obligations which have not been accounted for by reserves, or
otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the requirements of GAAP, on
the financial statements of the Company. The assets of each Company Employee

records of such Employee Benefit Plan.   (e) No Company Employee Plan (other
than the Company Stock Plans) has assets that include securities issued by
the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA

under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or the Company
has remaining a period of time under applicable U.S. Department of the
Treasury regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to
apply for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Qualified
Plan. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no such determination, opinion or advisory
letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and no such
Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since the date of its most
recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect, and no
act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect its qualification or materially increase its cost. There has been no
termination, partial termination or discontinuance of contributions to any
Qualified Plan   20    EXECUTION COPY  that will result in material
liability to the Company. Each Company Employee Plan which is required to
satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested
for compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects the requirements
of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be,
for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date for which testing is
required to be completed.   (g) Neither the Company, any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever
maintained a Company Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company
Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary
employees\' beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code.   (h) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Company Employee Plan (other than the Company Stock Plans or an employment,
severance, change in control or similar agreement with an individual) is
amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company and any of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at any time without
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result
thereof, other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or
termination and routine administrative costs.   (i) Other than as required
under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the Company Employee Plans
promises or provides health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal
claims for benefits under the Company\'s group life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and policies) or
coverage to any person following retirement or other termination
of employment. Section 3.13(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each Company Employee Plan which provides benefits after termination of
employment (other than medical benefits required to be continued under
Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) and
normal claims for benefits under the Company\'s group life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and
policies) and the present value of benefits accrued under each such Company
Employee Plan are fully funded, fully covered by insurance or reflected on
the Company Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.   (j) There is no
action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or investigation pending
or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Company
Employee Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course. No
Company Employee Plan is or within the last three calendar years has been the
subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject of, examination by
a government agency or a participant in a government sponsored amnesty,
voluntary compliance or similar program.   (k) To the Company\'s Knowledge,
each individual who has received compensation for the performance of services
on behalf of the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has been properly classified as an employee or
independent contractor in accordance with applicable Law.   21   
EXECUTION COPY   (l) Each Company Employee Plan maintained or
covering employees outside the United States, and the books and records
thereof, is in material compliance with all applicable Laws of each
applicable jurisdiction. Section 3.13(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists each country in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates has operations and the number of employees in each such
country.   (m) Section 3.13(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true, complete and correct list of (i) all employment agreements
with employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) all employees
or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have
executed a non-competition agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (iii) all severance agreements, programs and policies of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees,
excluding programs and policies required to be maintained by Law; and (iv)
all plans, programs, agreements and other arrangements of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which payments (or acceleration of benefits
or vesting of options or lapse of repurchase rights) may be required, or may
become payable directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with,
the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the
execution of, this Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of
the foregoing agreements to which any employee of the Company is a party have
been made available to Parent.   (n) All contributions required to be made
with respect to any Company Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective Time
have been or will be timely made or are reflected on the Company Balance
Sheet. There are no pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims by
or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any
such Company Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).   (o) The negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or
officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to severance pay, or
any other payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, a lapse of repurchase rights or
increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer. There
is no Company Employee Plan or other contract, agreement, plan or arrangement
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.  
Section 3.14 Labor Matters.   (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, including, without

which have heretofore been provided to Parent.   (c) There are no actions,
suits, claims, grievances, investigations, or other proceedings pending or,
to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened, between (i) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and/or any of their current or former officers, directors,
employees, or representatives, in their capacities as such) and (ii) any of
their respective current or former employees, consultants or independent
contractors, or any applicant for employment or classes of the foregoing, or
any Governmental Entity, which actions, suits, claims, grievances,
investigations, or other proceedings have or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good
labor relations, and the Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and their
respective employees, agents or representatives have not committed any unfair
labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations Act. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to
(and none of the Company\'s and/or any of its Subsidiaries\' properties or
assets is bound by or subject to) any labor agreement, collective bargaining
agreement, work rules or practices, or any other labor-related agreements or
arrangements with any labor union, labor organization, trade union or works
council. There are no labor agreements, collective bargaining agreements,
work rules or practices, or any other labor-related agreements or
arrangements that pertain to any of the employees of the Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries, and no employees of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries are represented by any labor union, labor organization, trade
union or works council with respect to their employment with the Company

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (f) No employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (i) to the Company\'s Knowledge is in violation of
any term of any patent disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or
any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right  
23    EXECUTION COPY  of any such employee to be employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or

or relating to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others,
or (ii) in the case of any key employee or group of key employees, has given
notice as of the date of this Agreement to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that such employee or any employee in a group of key employees
intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (g) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are and have
been in compliance with all notice and other requirements under the Worker

property or assets subject thereto. Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure

any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or assets, (b)
to Parent\'s Knowledge, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective properties or assets or (c) whether filed or

described in the Parent SEC Reports (or to be filed as exhibits thereto) are
so described or filed and are in full force and effect. "Parent Material

date of this Agreement, (i) there is no breach or violation of or default by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the Parent Material Contracts,
except such breaches, violations and defaults as have been waived, and (ii)
no event has occurred with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach,
violation or default, or give rise to a right of termination, modification,
cancellation, foreclosure, imposition of a Lien, prepayment or acceleration
under any of the Parent Material Contracts, which breach, violation or
default referred to in clauses (i) or (ii), would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.13 Employee Benefit Plans, Options and
Employment Agreements.   (a) Section 4.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Employee Benefit
Plans maintained, or contributed to by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any

contribute, or under which any of them has or may have any liability for
premiums or benefits for the   40    EXECUTION COPY  benefit of
employees located in the United States (collectively, the "Parent Employee
Plans").   (b) With respect to each Parent Employee Plan, Parent has
made available to the Company complete and accurate copies of (i) such
Parent Employee Plan (or a written summary of any unwritten plan) together
with all amendments, (ii) in the case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are
required to be filed, the most recent annual report (Form 5500) with
schedules attached, (iii) in the case of any plan that is intended to be

management or investment advisory agreements, (v) the most recent summary
plan descriptions and employee handbook, or other similar material employee
communications relating to employee benefits matters, (vi) all personnel,
payroll and employment manuals and policies, and (vii) the most recent
financial statements for each Parent Employee Plan that is funded.   (c)
Each Parent Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws and the
regulations thereunder and materially in accordance with its terms and each
of Parent, its Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have in all
material respects met their obligations with respect to each Parent Employee
Plan and have timely made (or timely will make) all required contributions
thereto. All filings and reports as to each Parent Employee Plan required to
have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States
Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Parent
Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and, to Parent\'s Knowledge,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which
Parent, its Subsidiaries or any plan participant could be subject to any
material liability (including penalties or taxes) under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Law, nor will the negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement give rise to any such material
liability.   (d) With respect to the Parent Employee Plans, there are
no material benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made
or properly accrued and there are no benefit obligations which have not
been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance
with the requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of Parent. The
assets of each Parent Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their
fair market value on the books and records of such Parent Employee Plan.  
(e) No Parent Employee Plan has assets that include securities issued by
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates.   (f) All the Parent Employee Plans that are Qualified
Plans have received determination, opinion or advisory letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Parent Employee Plans are
qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or
Parent has remaining a period of time under applicable U.S. Department of the
Treasury regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to
apply for such   41    EXECUTION COPY  a letter and to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the qualified
status of each such Qualified Plan. To Parent\'s Knowledge, no such
determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and revocation has
not been threatened, and no such Parent Employee Plan has been amended or
operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan that
will result in material liability to Parent. Each Parent Employee Plan which
is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has
been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects
the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as
the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date for
which testing is required to be completed.   (g) Neither Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever
maintained a Parent Employee Plan which was ever subject to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is
subject to ERISA. No Parent Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or
related to a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.   (h) To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each Parent Employee Plan (other than the Parent Stock Plans
or an employment, severance, change in control or similar agreement with an
individual) is amendable and terminable unilaterally by Parent or one or more
of its Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at any time without
material liability to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof,
other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or
termination and routine administrative costs.   (i) Other than as required
under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the Parent Employee Plans
promises or provides health or other welfare benefits (excluding normal
claims for benefits under the Parent\'s group life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and policies) or
coverage to any person following retirement or other termination
of employment.   (j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration, audit or investigation pending or, to Parent\'s Knowledge,
threatened, with respect to any Parent Employee Plan, other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course. No Parent Employee Plan is or within the
last two calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice that
it is the subject of, examination by a government agency or a participant in
a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.  
(k) To Parent\'s Knowledge, each individual who has received compensation for
the performance of services on behalf of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective ERISA Affiliates has been properly classified as an employee
or independent contractor in accordance with applicable Law.   42   
EXECUTION COPY   (l) Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that covers employees outside
the United States, and the books and records thereof, (i) such plan is in
compliance with all applicable Laws of each applicable jurisdiction; (ii)
there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or
investigation pending or, to Parent\'s Knowledge, threatened, with respect to
such plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course; (iii) all
liabilities with respect to such plan are set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto in accordance
with GAAP; and (iv) no such plan is or within the last two calendar years has
been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the subject of, an
examination by a government agency or a participant in a government sponsored
amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program that has given rise to or is
reasonably expected to give rise to any liability.   (m) True, complete and
correct copies of each of the following agreements to which any employee of
Parent is a party have been made available to the Company: (i) all employment
agreements with employees of Parent; (ii) all employees or former employees
of Parent who have executed a non-competition agreement with Parent; (iii)
all severance agreements, programs and policies of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees, excluding programs and
policies required to be maintained by Law; and (iv) all plans, programs,
agreements and other arrangements of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which payments (or acceleration of benefits or
vesting of options or lapse of repurchase rights) may be required upon, or
may become payable directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection
with, the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or
the execution of, this Agreement.   (n) All contributions required to be
made with respect to any Parent Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective
Time have been or will be timely made or are reflected on the Parent\'s
Balance Sheet. There are no pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated
claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered
under any such Parent Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).   (o) The negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee or officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, or any other payment from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, cause a lapse of repurchase rights
or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer.
There is no Parent Employee Plan or other contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or 162(m) of
the Code.   Section 4.14 Labor Matters.   43    EXECUTION COPY   (a)
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws respecting employment, employment practices and
occupational safety and health, terms and conditions of employment and wages
and hours, and is not engaged in any unfair labor practices; (b) to Parent\'s
Knowledge, there are no actions, suits, claims or grievances pending
or threatened, between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its
employees, consultants or independent contractors, which actions, suits,
claims or grievances have or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (c) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract
applicable to persons employed by Parent in the United States, nor does
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries know of any current activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees; and (d) to
Parent\'s Knowledge, there are no labor disputes, strikes, slowdowns, work
stoppages, lockouts, or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees
of, or consultants or independent contractors to, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in the United States.   Section 4.15 Properties;
Encumbrances.   Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title
to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the properties and assets which it
purports to own or lease (real, tangible, personal and mixed), including all
the properties and assets reflected in the Parent Balance Sheet (except for
personal property sold since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). All properties
and assets reflected in the Parent Balance Sheet are free and clear of all
Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet and Liens for
current taxes not yet due and other Liens that do not materially detract from
the value or impair the use of the property or assets subject thereto. All
material real property leases, licenses or other occupancy agreements to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the "Parent
Real Property Leases") are either filed as exhibits to the Parent SEC Reports
or complete copies thereof have been delivered to or made available to the
Company. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) all Parent Real Property
Leases are in full force and effect (except as such enforceability may be
subject to laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and
the relief of debtors and rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies); (ii) there is no existing
material breach or violation of or default by Parent under any of the Parent
Real Property Leases; (iii) no event has occurred with respect to Parent
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material
breach, violation or default of any of the Parent Real Property Leases; and
(iv) to Parent\'s Knowledge, there are no material breaches, defaults or
violations of any obligations of the landlord under any Parent Real
Property Lease.   Section 4.16 Taxes.   (a) Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have filed with the appropriate taxing authorities all material
Tax Returns required to be filed by them and all such Tax Returns were true,
complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes   44   
EXECUTION COPY  required to be paid by Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
have been timely paid. There are no Tax Liens on any assets of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries other than Liens relating to Taxes not yet due and
payable. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
outstanding waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any
outstanding extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes (exclusive of any accruals for "deferred
taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between tax and
financial accounting principles) reflected in the Parent Balance Sheet are
adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the date thereof (including
interest and penalties, if any, thereon and Taxes being contested)
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with the Parent
Balance Sheet. All liabilities for Taxes attributable to the period
commencing on the date following the date of the Parent Balance Sheet were
incurred in the ordinary course of business and are consistent in type and
amount with Taxes attributable to similar prior periods.   (b) Parent and

Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of
any audit examination, deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or
matter in controversy with respect to any Tax Return of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or tax allocation agreements with any
entity other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Except for the group
of which Parent and its Subsidiaries are now currently members, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an affiliated
group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for the Taxes of any person
under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.  
(c) To the extent requested by the Company, Parent made available to the
Company complete and correct copies of all income Tax Returns, examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to all taxable years for
which the statutes of limitation have not expired.   (d) Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of
the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code (A) in the two years prior to the date of this
Agreement or (B) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) in connection with the Merger.   (e) Neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a
party to, any tax shelter arrangement as described in Internal Revenue

Parent is not aware of any basis upon which the Internal Revenue Service
could reasonably challenge the tax-free treatment of the spin-off of Parent
by Allergan, Inc.   Section 4.17 Environmental Matters.   Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with federal, state, local and foreign
Laws and regulations relating to Materials of Environmental Concern, or
otherwise relating to Environmental Laws, and including, but not limited to,
compliance with any Parent Permits or other governmental authorizations or
the terms and conditions thereof; (b) neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any communication or notice, whether from
a governmental authority or otherwise, alleging any violation of or
noncompliance with any Environmental Laws by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for which it is responsible, and there is no pending or
threatened claim, action, investigation or notice by any person or entity
alleging potential liability for investigatory, cleanup or governmental
response costs, or natural resources or property damages, or personal
injuries, attorney\'s fees or penalties relating to Environmental Claims,
except where such Environmental Claims would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or otherwise require disclosure in the Parent SEC Reports; and
(c) there are no past or present facts or circumstances that could reasonably
be expected to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or against any person or entity whose liability for
any Environmental Claim Parent has retained or assumed either contractually
or by operation of Law, except where such Environmental Claim, if made, would
not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or otherwise require disclosure in
the Parent SEC Reports. Parent has provided to the Company all third party,
non-privileged assessments, reports, data, results of investigations or
audits in the possession of Parent regarding environmental matters pertaining
to the environmental condition of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, or the compliance (or noncompliance) by Parent or
its Subsidiaries with any Environmental Laws.   Section 4.18 Intellectual

conducted.   (c) The material Intellectual Property that is used in
the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, is
to Parent\'s Knowledge subsisting (except with respect to applications), and
has not expired or been cancelled, or abandoned.   46    EXECUTION
COPY   (d) There is no pending or, to Parent\'s Knowledge, threatened, and
at no time since June 29, 2002 through to the date of this Agreement
has there been pending any, material suit, arbitration or other
adversarial proceeding before any court, government agency or arbitral
tribunal or in any jurisdiction alleging that any activities or conduct of
Parent\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' business infringes or will infringe
upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property
of any third party or challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability or
registerability of any Intellectual Property owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees, stipulations,
judgments, or orders resulting from suits, actions or similar legal
proceedings which (i) materially restrict Parent\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' rights to use any Intellectual Property owned by and material
to the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted,
(ii) materially restrict the conduct of the business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted in order to accommodate any
third party\'s Intellectual Property rights, or (iii) permit third parties to
use any Intellectual Property owned by and material to the business of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.   (e) To Parent\'s
Knowledge, the conduct of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted does not infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property rights owned by any third
party. Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect
the proprietary nature of the Intellectual Property owned by Parent and such
Subsidiary that is material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted. To Parent\'s Knowledge, no third party
is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Intellectual
Property owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and no
material Intellectual Property misappropriation, infringement dilution or
violation suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings have been
brought before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal against any
third party by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which remain unresolved.  
(f) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has delivered (or granted
a conditional release of) any of its source code contained in any material
proprietary product currently being marketed, sold, licensed or developed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each such product, a "Parent Proprietary
Product").   (g) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any material license, sublicense, agreement or instrument to
which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is party or otherwise bound under
which the Parent or its Subsidiaries derive rights to Intellectual Property
that is material to the Parent\'s or its Subsidiaries\' business as currently
conducted.   Section 4.19 FDA Compliance.   47    EXECUTION COPY  
(a) All products currently being manufactured, tested, developed, processed,
labeled, stored or distributed by or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the FDA, are being
manufactured, tested, developed, processed, labeled, stored, distributed, and
marketed in compliance with all applicable Laws, guidances or orders
administered or issued by the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, including
without limitation, the FDA\'s current Good Manufacturing
Practice regulations, except where any failure to so comply would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All applicable operations of Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have achieved and maintained ISO 13485 Quality System
certification, and there is no pending or, to Parent\'s Knowledge threatened,
audit, repeal, failure to renew or challenge to any such certifications. All
products being manufactured by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with applicable registration, licensing and notification
requirements required by applicable Law for each site at which a product of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is manufactured except where any failure to
so comply would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All pre-clinical and clinical
trials being conducted by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
are being conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and guidances of
the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, including without limitation, the
FDA\'s current Good Clinical Practice regulations and federal and state Laws,
regulations and guidances restricting the use and disclosure of individually
identifiable health information except where any failure to so comply would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
not the subject, officially or otherwise, of any pending or threatened
investigation by the FDA pursuant to its "Fraud, Untrue Statements
of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" Final Policy set forth in
56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) and any amendments thereto. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has committed any act, made any statement,
or failed to make any statement that would provide a basis for the FDA to
invoke its policy with respect to "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material
Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities" and any amendments thereto. To
Parent\'s Knowledge, each product distributed, sold or leased, or service
rendered, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries complies in all material
respects with all applicable product safety standards of each applicable
product safety agency, commission, board or other Governmental Entity.  
(b) The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable FDA import and export requirements, including, but not limited to,

merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or Parent or any of

(ii) adopt, approve or recommend to its stockholders  that they accept, or
propose publicly to adopt, approve or recommend, any  Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, each of the Company Board and the Parent Board may effect a Change

time such action is taken, (ii) the Company Stockholders Meeting or the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, has not occurred, and (iii) the

such Superior Proposal has provided the other party hereto five business days
prior written notice that its Board of Directors intends to take such action,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and

has received the foregoing notice shall make a counterproposal to the party
hereto that is proposing to effect a Change of Recommendation or approve or
recommend to its stockholders that they accept, or propose publicly to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Superior Proposal, the party that is proposing to

negotiate on its behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such
counterproposal.   (d) Nothing set forth in this Section 6.3 shall
prohibit either party hereto from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the

Parent Board, as the case may be, determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, however, that any action taken or disclosure
made pursuant to such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect
that any action taken or disclosure made pursuant to such rules has under any
other provision of this Agreement.   (e) Nothing set forth in this Section
6.3 shall (i) permit either party hereto to terminate this Agreement (ii)
affect any other obligation of the parties under this Agreement, (iii) limit

respective Merger Stockholders Meeting, (iv) relieve either party hereto of
its obligation to submit to a vote of its stockholders the Company

Proposal at its respective Merger Stockholders Meeting, or (v) permit either
party hereto to submit for a vote of its respective stockholders at or prior

than the Parent Voting Proposal and the Company Voting Proposal, as
applicable.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
party receiving it determines in good faith (after (i) consultation with
its independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
(ii) taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement, including (A) any counterproposal by the other party to
this Agreement, (B) the likelihood that the transactions contemplated by
such Acquisition Proposal will close in a timely manner, and (C) the extent
to which the financing for the transactions contemplated by such Acquisition
Proposal, to the extent required, is committed or is capable of being
obtained on the terms proposed) is more favorable to such party\'s
stockholders than the Merger or the counter proposal.   Section 6.4 Joint

Agreement, each of the Company or Parent, after consultation with the other,
may adjourn or postpone its respective Merger Stockholders Meeting to the

or, if as of the time for which the applicable Merger Stockholders Meeting is

to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (v)
furnishing the other with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as each of them may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 6.6 as "counsel only" and,
in such event, such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the legal counsel of the recipient and shall not be disclosed
by such counsel to non-legal directors, officers, employees or other advisors
or representatives of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.6 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall
be required to (i) sell or dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or
otherwise) any assets or businesses or interests in any assets or businesses

any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to carry

full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to achieve such intent.   Section 6.7 Rights

this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, the
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, in connection with the execution,

(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time and for so long as
this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to Article VIII,
Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (i) take any action to deem the Company to be an Acquiring Person,
(ii) issue or cause to be issued any Rights to stockholders of Parent as a

under applicable Law.   Section 6.8 Public Announcements.   Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may upon consultation with outside counsel be required by
applicable Law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE if it has used all
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party prior thereto
regarding the timing, scope and content of any such press release or public
statement, and provided, further, no such consultation shall be required to
make any disclosure or otherwise take any action expressly permitted by
Section 6.3.   Section 6.9 Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan.   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving

Effective Time (the "Company Employees") in connection with all employee  
67    EXECUTION COPY  benefit plans, programs or policies (including
vacation) of Parent or its affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible
to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and levels of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or
benefit amounts under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
such recognition would result in duplication of benefits). From and after the
Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide Company
Employees for so long as such Company Employees remain so employed, health
and welfare benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies
or arrangements maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing
coverage and benefits which are no less favorable than those provided to
employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by Company
Employees with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time after the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations
and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting periods
would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company) under
any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with respect
to Company Employees and their eligible dependents. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, give each Company Employee credit for any
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses paid
during the applicable period under any welfare plans maintained or
contributed to by the Company prior to the Closing in satisfying any
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses for the
corresponding period under any welfare plans maintained or contributed to by
Parent or its affiliates.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the

Plan (the "401(k) Plan") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate (after
reasonable consultation with the Company), including terminating the 401(k)
Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and
applicable Law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate
participation of the Company Employees in any successor plan.   Section
6.10 Stock Plans.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the
rights and obligations of the Company with respect to the 2000 Plan as well
as the duties of the Company with respect to the administration of such
plan.   (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (other than
phantom units of Company Common Stock) that has an exercise price equal to or
less than $26.93 (the "Merger Consideration Value"), and is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable (each, an "Assumed Option"), shall be fully vested and
immediately exercisable and assumed by Parent. In accordance with its terms,
each Assumed Option shall be converted into an option to acquire that number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (x) the product of the
number of shares of Company   68    EXECUTION COPY  Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the Exchange Ratio and (y) the quotient of the Cash Merger Consideration
divided by the Parent Closing Price (which sum shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share), at a price per share equal to the aggregate exercise
price of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option divided by the
number of shares determined under (x) and (y) above (which price per
share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The Assumed Option
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the respective Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option
that qualified as an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the
Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the maximum extent permissible,
following the Effective Time.   (c) Prior to the Closing Date, (i) each
Company Stock Option that has an exercise price in excess of the Merger
Consideration Value and is outstanding on the date hereof, whether or not
then vested or exercisable (each, a "Cancelled Option"), shall be fully
vested and immediately exercisable; (ii) the Company shall notify the holders
of each such Cancelled Option that if such options are not exercised within
the period ending fifteen (15) days (thirty (30) days in the case of Company
Stock Options granted under the 1995 Director Plan) from the date of such
notice, such Cancelled Option shall expire as of the last day of such period
and be of no further force or effect.   (d) At the Effective Time, each
Phantom Unit Account that contains phantom units of Company Common Stock
("Phantom Units") immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested (each, an "Assumed Phantom Unit Account"), shall be fully vested
and assumed by Parent. Each Assumed Phantom Unit Account shall be converted
into a deferral account under the 1995 Director Plan with respect to the
phantom units of Parent Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the product of
the number of Phantom Units in such Assumed Phantom Unit Account immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient of
the Cash Merger Consideration divided by the Parent Closing Price (which sum
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share). The Assumed Phantom Unit
Account and phantom units of Parent Common Stock held therein shall otherwise
be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Phantom Unit Account immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (e) If and
to the extent necessary or required by the terms of any Company Stock Plan or
any Company Stock Option, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time,
amend the terms of its equity incentive plans or arrangements, to give effect
to the provisions of Sections 6.10(b) and 6.10(c).   (f) As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in any event within five (5)
business days thereafter (to the extent Parent has received the most recent
copies of the relevant Company Stock Plans), Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to the outstanding Assumed Options and
Assumed Phantom Unit Accounts, Parent shall cause the same to become
effective, and Parent shall take such further   69    EXECUTION
COPY  actions as may be reasonably necessary to cover under such
registration statement shares of Parent Common Stock held by those persons
eligible immediately prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the 1995 Director
Plan.   Section 6.11 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) For six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its current
or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
(the "Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six years following
the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate or articles of incorporation
and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate or
articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six year period, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by
Law.   (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the existing
policy of the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' and fiduciary liability
insurance (the "DandO; Policy") covering claims arising from facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts
or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent that such acts or
omissions are covered by the DandO; Policy) and covering each Indemnified Party
who is covered as of the Effective Time by the DandO; Policy on terms with
respect to coverage and amounts that are no less favorable than those terms
in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
(which annual premium is set forth on Schedule 6.11(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum
Annual Premium"); and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO; Policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous than the DandO; Policy, provided that the
amount paid by the Company for such "tail" policy shall not exceed six times
the Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the   70    EXECUTION
COPY  Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in
full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 6.11(b) for so long as
such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.   (c) The
obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries under this Section 6.11 shall be joint and several.   (d) The
obligations under this Section 6.11 shall not be terminated, amended or
otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO; Policy or the
"tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO; Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO; Policy or the "tail" policy
