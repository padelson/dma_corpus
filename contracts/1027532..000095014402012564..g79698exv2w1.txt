55    ii   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of December 8, 2002 (this "Agreement"), is made and entered
into by and among AMY HOLDING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), AMY
ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition"), and AMERIPATH,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").    RECITALS   WHEREAS, the
Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company (in the
case of the Company acting on the recommendation of a special committee (the
"Special Committee") formed for the purpose of representing the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) has unanimously deemed
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for
Acquisition to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") pursuant
to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;   WHEREAS, the Board
of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company has unanimously
adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and   WHEREAS,
Parent, Acquisition and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.    AGREEMENT   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:   
ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL,
Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time
(as hereinafter defined). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Acquisition shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation under the name "Ameripath, Inc." and shall succeed to
and assume all of the rights and obligations of Acquisition in accordance
with the DGCL. Acquisition and the Company are sometimes hereinafter referred
to as the "Constituent Corporations" and, as the context requires, the
Company is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation."   1.2 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated and the Merger shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1,
the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place as promptly
as practical following the satisfaction and/or waiver (subject to applicable
law) of all of the conditions (other than those conditions which by their
nature are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions) set forth in Article VI (and, in any event, not
less than two business days following the satisfaction and/or waiver of all
such conditions) (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Reboul, MacMurray,
Hewitt and Maynard, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10111, unless
another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.   1.3 Effective Time of the Merger. At Closing, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon such
filing or at such time thereafter as Parent, Acquisition and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective
Time").   1.4 Effects of the Merger.   (a) The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.   (b) The directors of Acquisition and
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws.   (c) Subject to Section 5.5(a), the Certificate of
Incorporation of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and the DGCL.   (d) The Bylaws of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation.    ARTICLE II   EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON
THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES  OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE
PROCEDURES   2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock") or Parent:   (a) Common Stock of Acquisition. Each
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition (the
"Acquisition Common Stock") issued and outstanding   2  immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Company
Common Stock Owned by Parent or Acquisition. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent or Acquisition or any affiliate of Parent or
Acquisition or held in the treasury of the Company, in each case together
with the Rights (as hereinafter defined) associated therewith (collectively,
the "Excluded Shares"), shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.   (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares (as
hereinafter defined), together with the Rights associated therewith, shall be
converted into the right to receive in cash from the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger an amount equal to $21.25 (the "Merger
Consideration").   (d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock (and associated
Rights) that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by a holder who has validly demanded payment of the
fair value for such holder\'s shares as determined in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holder\'s appraisal right under the DGCL (but instead
shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
DGCL). If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holder (and each
associated Right) shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock (and
associated Right) that had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to settle, or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.   (e) Cancellation and
Retirement of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) and
all associated Rights that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock and
associated Rights being converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (the "Certificates") shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or
associated Rights, except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the
Merger Consideration per share multiplied by the number of shares so
represented, to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b).   3   (f) Certain
Adjustments. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, solely as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock distribution which
in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders, there is
a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or
issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common
Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate
the effects of such event.    2.2 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Paying
Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
the Certificates. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
deposit (and Parent shall cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of such Certificates, for use in the payment
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash consideration being hereinafter
referred to as the "Merger Fund"). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation given at the Closing,
make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger Fund. The Merger
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.   (b) Exchange Procedures.
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person (as hereinafter defined) who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock and
whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
otherwise be in a form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify) containing instructions for use
by holders of Company Common Stock to effect the exchange of their shares
of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration as provided herein. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, each holder of an
outstanding Certificate or Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto (together with such other documents as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) and such Certificate or Certificates
(or, if such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon
the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares
of Company Common Stock on a book-entry account statement (it being
understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to
include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock)), be entitled to an amount of cash
(payable by check) equal to the Merger Consideration per share multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
or Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates,
and if such Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration. If cash is to
be remitted to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate   4  surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be
a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), at any time after the
Effective Time, each Certificate shall be deemed to represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration upon such surrender as contemplated by
Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable as
Merger Consideration.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock Exchanged for Cash. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.   (d) Termination of Merger Fund. Any portion of the Merger Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 270 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as
general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to
escheat and abandoned property and similar Laws. As used herein, "Laws" means
any statute, law, ordinance, rule, regulation, Nasdaq or other stock exchange
rule or listing requirement, permit or authorization applicable to a Person
(as hereinafter defined) or such Person\'s Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets.   (e) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined)), any such cash in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   (f) Investment of
Merger Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Merger Fund solely
in Cash Equivalents (as defined below) as directed by the Surviving
Corporation. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. As used herein,
"Cash Equivalents" means, as of any date of determination, (i) marketable
securities (a) issued or directly and unconditionally guaranteed as to
interest and principal by the United States government or (b) issued by any
agency of the   5  United States the obligations of which are backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States, in each case maturing within
six months after such date; (ii) marketable direct obligations issued by any
state of the United States of America or any political subdivision of any
such state or any public instrumentality thereof, in each case maturing
within six months after such date and having, at the time of the acquisition
thereof, the highest rating obtainable from either Standard and Poor\'s Ratings
Group ("SandP;") or Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody\'s"); (iii)
commercial paper maturing no more than six months from the date of creation
thereof and having, at the time of the acquisition thereof, a rating of at
least A-1 from SandP; or at least P-1 from Moody\'s; (iv) certificates of
deposit maturing within six months after such date and issued or accepted by
any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America
or any state thereof or the District of Columbia that (a) is at least
"adequately capitalized" (as defined in the regulations of its primary
Federal banking regulator) and (b) has Tier 1 capital (as defined in such
regulations) of not less than $100,000,000; and (v) shares of any
money market mutual fund that (a) has at least 95% of its assets invested
continuously in the types of investments referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
above, (b) has net assets of not less than $500,000,000, and (c) has the
highest rating obtainable from either SandP; or Moody\'s.   (g) Withholding
Rights. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to such holder such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.   (h) Lost Certificates. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement.   2.3 Effect of the Merger
on Options and Warrants. (a) Each of the Company\'s stock option plans,
programs and arrangements (the "Stock Plans") and outstanding options to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options"),
including information concerning the Stock Plan under which such options were
issued, the holders thereof, the number of shares subject thereto, the
exercise prices thereof, the dates of scheduled vesting thereof and the terms
thereof that require acceleration of such vesting by virtue of the Merger,
are set forth on Schedule 2.3(a).   (b) Subject to Section 2.3(e) below, at
the Effective Time of the Merger (and the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee administering the Stock Plans shall take all actions
necessary so that), all outstanding Company Stock Options heretofore
granted   6  under any Stock Plan become fully vested and exercisable at
the Effective Time and shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time of
an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the per share Merger
Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have
been exercised.   (c) The Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective
Time of the Merger, and the provisions in any other benefit plan providing
for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or
any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted
as of the Effective Time of the Merger, and the Company shall take such
actions to ensure that following the Effective Time of the Merger no holder
of a Company Stock Option or any participant in any Stock Plan or other
benefit plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock or
any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) All outstanding warrants to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Company Warrants"), including information concerning the
holders thereof, the number of shares subject thereto and the exercise prices
thereof, are set forth on Schedule 2.3(d). As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take such actions (which shall include attempting to obtain all required
consents of holders of Company Warrants) as may be necessary to effectuate
the cancellation at the Effective Time of each Company Warrant in exchange
for a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration per share over the exercise price per share of such
Company Warrant and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Warrant.   (e) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Section 2.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options or Company Warrants such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Stock Options or Company Warrants in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

organizations or associations are otherwise owned or controlled by the
Company and/or one or more of its other Subsidiaries; (iv) "Company Managed

of  notice, the passage of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to 
result in a Violation, Order or deficiency with respect to any of the items 
listed on Schedule 3.1(g)(i) or a revocation, withdrawal or suspension of 
any such license, or a termination or modification of the participation of 
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Managed Practice in any

or adjustment other than in the ordinary course, and  no interest or
penalties accruing with respect thereto, except as has been  specifically

Loan Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to

of which would be in the form of term loans used to complete the transactions
contemplated hereby and $75,000,000 of which would be in the form of an

force and effect, all commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have
been paid in full or will be duly paid in full when due, and no event has
occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would

hereunder, to refinance any indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that may become due as a result of the transactions contemplated by this

the Company Common Stock as a result of the valid exercise of dissenters\'

Merger and the Financing. Neither Parent nor Acquisition is in breach or
default of any obligation owed to any creditor for borrowed money or any

beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature. Parent, Acquisition, and as
of the   33  Effective Time, Surviving Corporation, on a consolidated
basis, are not engaged nor currently contemplate being engaged in a business
or transaction for which any property remaining with them would be
insufficient to continue to operate their businesses or to pay their debts

suit, arbitration, inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Acquisition, or any of their Subsidiaries, or any of their
property or assets, or any outstanding Orders in connection with Parent or
Acquisition or their respective property or assets, which would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (i) Management
Arrangements. Parent has provided the Special Committee with true, correct
and complete copies of all contracts and agreements between Parent and/or
Acquisition (or any of their affiliates) and any of the officers and
directors of the Company (or any of its affiliates) that would

to be terminated any existing solicitation, initiation,
encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any parties conducted
heretofore by the Company, any Subsidiary thereof or any Company
Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b), if at
any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Company stockholders,
(i) the Company has otherwise complied with its obligations under this
Section 5.2 and the Company has received a bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party (including any Excluded
Party), (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) after
consultation with its legal advisors, the Board of Directors of the Company
or the Special Committee determines in good faith that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
(x) the Company may take any of the actions otherwise prohibited by Section
5.2(b) with respect to such third party and such Company Acquisition
Proposal; provided, that the Company (A) will provide notice to Parent of the
identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof prior to or promptly after (and in any
event within 24 hours after) commencing any such actions, provided that
Parent will hold all such information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) will not, and will not allow any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Representatives to, disclose any information
to such third party without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (C) will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person
which was not previously provided to Parent. Nothing contained in this
Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position
with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
other disclosure required by applicable Law.   (d) The Company shall keep
Parent generally informed on a prompt basis of the status of and material
developments respecting any solicitations, inquiries, proposals and/or
negotiations (including as to the material terms and price in respect of any
Company Acquisition   39   Proposal) that are made or conducted pursuant
to Section 5.2(a) or 5.2(c) no later than 24 hours after such material
development, and shall provide notice to Parent of any intent to take any of
the actions described in Section 7.1(f) or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g) (it being understood that the Company shall not
take any of the actions described in Section 7.1(f) or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(g) unless and until it provides
Parent not less than 72 hours notice of such action or termination, as the
case may be).   (e) As used in this Agreement, "Company Acquisition
Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of
Persons relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more
of the outstanding Company Common Stock, any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person or group of Persons
beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, or
any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a
Company Acquisition Proposal (but changing the references to the 20% amounts
in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal to 50%) made on terms which
the Board of Directors (or the Special Committee) in good faith determines
(based on such matters as it deems relevant, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside counsel), (a) would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to its
stockholders entitled to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder (in their
capacities as stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) is reasonably likely to be
completed.   (g) As used in this Agreement, an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a confidentiality and standstill
agreement that contains provisions which are no less favorable to the Company
than those contained in either (i) the Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) a
proposed amendment and/or restatement of the Confidentiality Agreement that
is signed by the Company and delivered to WCAS so long as such amendment
and/or restatement does not (x) contain or amend any provisions which are
less favorable to WCAS than the Confidentiality Agreement in effect as of the
date hereof or (y) amend or modify (including by adding any provision that
limits or conflicts with) the provisions of the fourth paragraph or the
eleventh paragraph of the Confidentiality Agreement in effect as of the date
hereof.   5.3 Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 5.3 and except with respect to claims for damages incurred as a
result of a willful and knowing breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquisition as described in Section 7.2, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses. The Company shall pay
all costs and expenses in connection with the printing and mailing of the
Proxy Statement, as well as all SEC filing fees related to the transactions
contemplated hereby.   40    (b) In the event of any termination of this
Agreement (i) by Parent under Section 7.1(f), (ii) by Parent under Section
7.1(d) so long as the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such right
of termination under Section 7.1(d) was a willful and knowing breach or
failure to perform, (iii) by the Company under Section 7.1(g), (iv) by Parent
or the Company under Section 7.1(c) so long as (A) a Company Acquisition
Proposal shall have been communicated to the Board of Directors of the
Company or the Special Committee or publicly announced prior to the
Termination Date (as hereinafter defined) and not withdrawn prior to the 30th
day preceding the Termination Date, (B) if Parent (rather than the Company)
shall have terminated under Section 7.1(c), the Special Meeting shall not
have been held prior to such termination under Section 7.1(c) for any reason
other than the continuance of any SEC review and comment process relating to
the Proxy Statement or the issuance by a court of competent jurisdiction of
an Order prohibiting the Special Meeting (but only so long as the Company\'s
knowing and willful breach of or failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement is not the primary source of such delay) and (C) within
twelve months after such termination pursuant to 7.1(c), the Company (and/or
its Subsidiaries) enter(s) into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummate(s), a transaction that would have constituted a
Company Acquisition Proposal (but changing the references to the 20% amounts
in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal to 50%) (the
"Subsequent Transaction") or (v) by Parent or the Company under Section
7.1(h) so long as (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced prior to the Special Meeting and not withdrawn prior to the second
business day preceding the mailing date of the Proxy Statement and (B) within
twelve months after such termination pursuant to 7.1(h), the Company (and/or
its Subsidiaries) enter(s) into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummate(s), a Subsequent Transaction, then the Company shall pay to Parent
or its designee, a fee in the amount of $12,912,000 (the "Company Termination
Fee"), in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent. The Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent (x) in the case of a termination as provided in Section 5.3(b)(i),
(ii) or (iii) above on the day of termination of this Agreement or (y) in the
case of a termination as provided in Section 5.3(b)(iv) or (v), on the date
of the entering into of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the
consummation of, as the case may be, the Subsequent Transaction. As used
herein, with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, "withdrawn" shall
mean that (i) such offer was withdrawn publicly or, if such Company
Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly announced, that the Board
of Directors or the Special Committee has confirmed in writing to Parent that
is has been withdrawn, (ii) since the withdrawal of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, there shall have been no further negotiations with
respect thereto between the Person making such proposal (or such Person\'s
representatives) and the Company (or any Company Representatives) and no
further delivery of confidential information by the Company (or any Company
Representatives) to such Person (or such Person\'s representatives) and (iii)
the Company shall have requested that the Person making such proposal return
or destroy all confidential information previously delivered to such Person
(or such Person\'s representatives); provided, that no Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be considered to have been "withdrawn" for purposes of this
Section 5.3(b) if, within twelve months after the termination of this
Agreement, the Company (and/or its Subsidiaries) enter(s) into a definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummate(s), a Subsequent Transaction with
the Person or group of Persons who made such Company Acquisition Proposal (or
any affiliate thereof).   41    5.4 Brokers or Finders.   (a) The
Company represents, as to itself, its Subsidiaries and its affiliates, that
no agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or
person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other
commission or similar fee in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for the Financial
Advisor, whose fees and expenses will be paid by the Company in accordance
with the Company\'s agreements with such firm.   (b) Parent and Acquisition
each represent as to itself, its subsidiaries and its affiliates that no
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person
engaged by Parent or Acquisition is or will be entitled to receive any
broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except
as set forth in the Financing Letters or as set forth on Schedule 5.4(b).  
5.5 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.   (a) All rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liability for acts and omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancements of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Indemnitees") as provided in their respective charters and/or bylaws
(or similar organizational documents) or in any indemnification
agreement listed on Schedule 5.5(a) shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such Indemnitees, unless an alteration or
modification of such documents is required by applicable Law or the
Indemnitee affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto. For six
years after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Indemnitees in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.  
(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide and maintain officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time ("DandO; Insurance") covering the persons
described in Section 5.5(a) (whether or not they are entitled to
indemnification thereunder) who are currently covered by the Company\'s
existing officers\' and directors\' or fiduciary liability insurance policies
on terms (particularly as to coverage and amount) no less advantageous in the
aggregate to such indemnified parties than such existing insurance (a copy of
which has been made available to Parent and Acquisition); provided, that the
Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an annual premium therefor
in excess of 200% of the annual premium being paid as of the date hereof,
which the Company represents and warrants to be $495,000 (the "Current
Premium"); and if the provision and maintenance of DandO; Insurance in
accordance with this Section 5.5(b) exceeds 200% of the Current Premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide the greatest amount of substantially
equivalent DandO; Insurance obtainable for 200% of the Current Premium.   (c)
In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or   42   surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, proper provisions shall be made so that
such Person assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5.   (d)
This Section 5.5, which shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the
Effective Time and shall continue for the periods specified herein, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and any Person
referenced in this Section 5.5 or indemnified hereunder, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.5 (whether or not parties to
this Agreement). The rights of this Section 5.5 shall be in addition to any
rights such Persons may have under the Company Certificate of Incorporation
or Company Bylaws or the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of any Company Subsidiary, or under Delaware Law or any other applicable laws
or under any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that is listed on Schedule 5.10.   5.6 Reasonable Best
Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable, under applicable Laws or otherwise, to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consent from third parties necessary to allow the Company and its
Subsidiaries to continue operating their business as presently conducted as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b)
In case at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the parties to
this Agreement shall direct their respective officers and directors to take
all such necessary action.   (c) The Company agrees to provide, and will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers and employees to
provide, all necessary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or
Acquisition in connection with the arrangement of, and the negotiation of
agreements with respect to, the Financing (and any substitutions or
replacements thereof), including by making available to Parent and
Acquisition and such financing sources and their representatives, personnel
(including for participation at organizational meetings, drafting sessions
for offering memoranda and in road shows), documents and information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested by Parent
or Acquisition or such financing sources and, if applicable, by cooperating
with financing sources in achieving a timely offering and/or syndication of
Financing (or such substitutions or replacements) reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and Acquisition and such financing sources.   (d) Neither Parent nor
Acquisition shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, take any
action to amend, terminate or rescind the Financing Letters in any manner
that would reasonably be expected to decrease the likelihood that the
Financing will be obtained at Closing and each shall use their reasonable
best efforts to satisfy the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing
Letters on or before the Termination Date.   43    (e) On or prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall enter into an amendment to the Amended and
Restated AmeriSERP Plan, effective as of January 1, 2002 (the "AmeriSERP
Plan"), pursuant to which Section 5.15 of the AmeriSERP Plan shall be deleted
in its entirety effective as of the Effective Time.   5.7 Publicity. The
parties will consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any press
release or other public announcement pertaining to the Merger or this
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be
required by applicable Law, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any
such press release or making any such public announcement.   5.8 Consents
and Approvals; State Takeover Laws.   (a) Parent, Acquisition and the
Company shall cooperate with one another in (i) determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be
obtained from parties to any contracts, agreements, commitments, leases,
licenses, arrangements, instruments or obligations, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) seeking timely
to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto shall file or
cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division")
any notification required to be filed by it or its "ultimate parent" company
under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such parties will
use their reasonable best efforts to make such filings promptly and to
respond on a timely basis to any requests for additional information made by
either of such agencies. Each of the parties hereto agrees to furnish the
other with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates
and their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity or members or their
respective staffs, on the other hand, with respect to the Merger, other than
personal financial information filed therewith.   (b) Each party hereto
shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and
file all necessary documentation to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any
consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption
or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made
by Parent, Acquisition or the Company or any of their respective affiliates
in connection with the Merger or the taking of any other action contemplated
by this Agreement.   (c) Each party hereto agrees to furnish the other with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party and
its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of
necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entities, including any filings necessary under the provisions
of the HSR Act.   44    (d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and its Board of Directors shall (i) use their commercially reasonable
efforts to take all action necessary or otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent or Acquisition to exempt the Merger from the provisions of any
applicable takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or
similar statute and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.   5.9 Notification of Certain Matters.
Each party shall give prompt written notice to each other party of (a) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) notice or communication from any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event of which it becomes aware that has caused
or would reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing Date, (d)
the commencement or threat of any Company Litigation or any other action,
suit, investigation or proceeding which relates to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the issuance of any Order affecting the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, in either case which, if pending or issued, as the case may be, on
or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 3.1 the failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.9 is for informational purposes and shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party
or parties receiving such notice. Except as otherwise provided in any such
notice, the delivery of any such notice shall not be deemed an admission or
an acknowledgment that (a) the subject matter of such notice is material or
would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, or is outside of the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with
past practices or (b) there has occurred an actual or an anticipatory breach
of, or failure to comply with or satisfy, any representation, warranty,
covenant, condition or agreement.   5.10 Continuation of Employee
Benefits.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will honor in accordance with their terms all
existing employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former
officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or group of such officers, directors, employees or
consultants.   (b) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation will not materially and adversely alter the benefits
(including health benefits, severance policies and general employment
policies and procedures) that are available to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (other than modifications to any employee
benefit plans in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and other than with respect to any equity-based compensation).
Nothing in this Section 5.10(b) shall be deemed to   45   prevent the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from making any change
required by applicable Law.   (c) To the extent permitted under applicable
Law, each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be given credit
for all service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or service credited by
the Company or its Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries in which they participate or in which they become participants
for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual including, for
purposes of determining (i) short-term and long-term disability benefits,
(ii) severance benefits, (iii) vacation benefits and (iv) benefits under any
retirement plan.   (d) This Section 5.10, which shall survive the
consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time and shall continue without
limit except as expressly set forth herein, is intended to benefit and bind
the Company, the Surviving Corporation and any Person referenced in this
Section 5.10, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.10
whether or not parties to this Agreement. Except as provided in clause (a)
above, nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall create any beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof)
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation in
respect of continued employment for any specified period of any nature or
kind whatsoever.   5.11 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Special
Meeting.   (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in any event no later than ten business days after the date hereof), the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The parties
will cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and mailed to its stockholders as promptly
as practicable after such filing. Each party agrees to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading. The Company will as promptly as practicable
notify Parent of (i) the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC
and (ii) any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on its draft of the Proxy Statement
(including each amendment or supplement thereto), and all responses to
requests for additional information by and replies to comments of the SEC,
prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the parties hereto
will provide each other with copies of all such filings made and
correspondence with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information should be discovered by any party which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company.   46   
(b) Subject to the next two sentences of this Section 5.11(b), the Company
shall, acting through its Board of Directors and in accordance
with applicable Law and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the "Special
Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and, in no event
later than 45 days after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of the Company) for the purpose of considering and taking action
upon this Agreement and the Merger and shall solicit proxies in favor of
approval of this Agreement and the Merger. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company\'s stockholders (subject to the following, such recommendation,
together with a copy of the opinion referred to in Section 3.1(n), shall be
included in the Proxy Statement); provided, that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may
determine (i) not to make or may withdraw, modify or change such
recommendation and (ii) not to solicit proxies in favor of this Agreement and
the Merger and/or not to hold the Special Meeting if, in the case of both
clauses (i) and (ii), the Special Committee has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, that
(a) the Company has received a Company Acquisition Proposal that
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (b) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company under applicable Law. The Company may, if
it has complied with the provisions of Section 5.2 and this Section 5.11, and
it receives a written bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that it
reasonably expects could result in a Superior Proposal, delay the mailing of
the Proxy Statement or the holding of the Special Meeting, in each case, for
such time (not to exceed ten business days) as is necessary for the Board of
Directors of the Company to consider such Company Acquisition Proposal and to
determine the effect, if any, on its recommendation in favor of the
Merger.   5.12 Consequences If Rights Are Triggered. If any Distribution
Date (under and as defined in the Rights Agreement) or Stock Acquisition Date
(under and as defined in the Rights Agreement) occurs under the Rights
Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time other than as a result of the actions of Parent,
Acquisition or their respective affiliates, the Company, Parent, and
Acquisition shall make such adjustment to the per share Merger Consideration
(without any increase in the aggregate Merger Consideration) as the Company,
Parent and Acquisition shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic
benefits that the parties each reasonably expected on the date of this
Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Merger.   
ARTICLE VI   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   6.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been made,
obtained or effected, as the case may be, except for those, the failure of
which to be made, obtained or effected has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material

materially restricts the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that prior to invoking this condition, each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such legal

true and correct as of such specified date) except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct would not have a
Parent   49   Material Adverse Effect, and the Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Acquisition by their
respective presidents, and, as to the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.2(g), their respective primary financial officers, to the

respect to any such representation, warranty or obligation cannot be cured

or   (h) by Parent or the Company, if the Special Meeting is held and
the Company fails to obtain Company Stockholder Approval at the Special
Meeting (or any adjournment thereof).  Any party desiring to terminate this
Agreement shall give written notice of such termination to the other
parties.   7.2 Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of any termination of
this Agreement by any party hereto as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or further
obligation hereunder on the part of any party hereto or their  
51   respective affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, except
that the last sentence of Section 5.1(a), Section 5.3, Section 5.4, this
Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall survive such termination.   (b) Except
for the termination rights provided in Section 7.1 and except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.2, the Company acknowledges and agrees that its remedy
for any claim asserted by the Company against Parent or Acquisition,
including, without limitation, any claim that arises out of or relates in any
way to the negotiation, entry into, performance, or the terms of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the breach or
claimed breach thereof shall be limited to the remedy as agreed to in the
Contingency Letter Agreement among WCAS, the Company and Parent dated of even
date herewith and such remedy shall only be available if this Agreement shall
have been terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and such
breaches or claimed breaches by Parent and/or Acquisition giving rise to such
termination were knowing and willful.   (c) Except for the termination
rights provided in Section 7.1 and except as otherwise provided in Section

asserted by Parent or Acquisition against the Company, including, without

negotiation, entry into, performance, or terms of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the breach or claimed breach thereof,
Parent and Acquisition shall be entitled to only a single recovery, and such
recovery shall be as specified in Section 5.3 hereof; (ii) such recovery
shall be Parent and Acquisition\'s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such claim, and all other damages or remedies, at law or in equity
(including provisional remedies) are waived; (iii) it is the intent of Parent
and Acquisition that the limitations imposed hereby on remedies and
the measure of damages shall apply regardless of the theory upon which
recovery hereunder is sought.    ARTICLE VIII   MISCELLANEOUS    8.1
Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time except for covenants and
agreements that contemplate performance after the Effective Time (which
covenants and agreements shall survive in accordance with their terms).  
8.2 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement would give
rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy and accordingly the parties agree that, in addition to any other
remedies, each party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement
by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.   8.3 Notices. Any notice or
communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be delivered personally, delivered by nationally recognized overnight courier
service, sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, or sent by

used herein, the words "hereof", "herein", "herewith" and words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this
Agreement as   53   a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and the words "Article" and "Section" are references to the
articles and sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Unless
otherwise provided herein, each accounting term used in this Agreement has
the meaning given to it in accordance with GAAP. As used in this Agreement,
the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The definitions contained in this
Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such
terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of
such terms. Any agreement or statute referred to herein means such agreement
or statute as from time to time amended, qualified or supplemented,
including, in the case of statutes, by succession of comparable successor
statutes. References to the Securities Act and to the Exchange Act are also
references to the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. References to a Person are also to its successors and permitted
assigns. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. As used in this
Agreement, the phrase "to the knowledge of the Company" shall mean to the
actual knowledge of the individuals listed on Schedule 8.4, after reasonable
inquiry.   8.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile), each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.   8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement, including the schedules hereto, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement).
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party
hereto and to their respective successors and permitted assigns, and, except
as provided in Section 5.5 and Section 5.10, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.   8.7 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented, only by written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the
Company at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the
terms contained herein; provided, that, after Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, no term or condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended
or modified in any manner that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without so obtaining such further stockholder
approval.   8.8 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereby, (b)  
54   waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed by such party. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.   8.9 Governing Law. This Agreement, and
all claims arising hereunder, shall be governed and construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of Law thereof.   8.10 Submission to
Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the state
of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that, subject to rights with respect to
post-trial motions and rights of appeal or other avenues of review, a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any other state court of the
State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.   8.11 Assignment. No party hereto shall assign this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be null
and void.   8.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by
final judgment no longer subject to review, to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as neither the
economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein is
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner.    [THE REMAINDER
OF THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK]   55    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
