ARTICLE 2

THE OFFER 

Section 2.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that nothing shall have occurred that would give rise to a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Article_ __ _ 8_, Buyer shall
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the 1934 Act) the
Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
but in no event later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following the
date of this Agreement. The obligations of Buyer to accept for payment, and
pay for, any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of
the conditions set forth in _Annex_ __ _ I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
date on which Buyer commences the Offer is referred to as the " _Offer
Commencement Date_."

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is not prohibited by
applicable Law) of the Offer Conditions, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause
Buyer to) (i) at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time
(but in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), accept for
payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and
(ii) at or as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act) thereafter), pay (by delivery of
funds to the depositary for the Offer) for, all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as of the Acceptance Time (the "
_Closing_ "). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." The Offer Consideration payable in
respect of each Share pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid, net of
any applicable Tax withholding with respect to the Offer Consideration
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, to the seller in cash, without interest,
on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

 



13 (c) Buyer expressly reserves the right at any time to, in its sole discretion,
waive, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; _provided_ , that without
the prior written consent of the Company, Buyer shall not (and Parent shall
cause Buyer to not):

 

(i) waive or change the Minimum Condition (except to the extent contemplated
under _paragraph_ __ _ (A)_ of  _Annex_ __ _ I_);

(ii) decrease the Offer Consideration;

 

(iii) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

(iv) decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 

(v) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement; or

 

(vi) impose additional Offer Conditions or otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the Offer Conditions or terms of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares.

(d) The Offer shall initially expire at 9:00 a.m. (New York City time), or
at such other time as the Parties may mutually agree, on the date that is the
later of (i) twenty-one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) following the commencement of the
Offer and (ii) such date as is six (6) Business Days after the date of the EGM
(such initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(e)_, the date and time to which the Offer
has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later expiration
date and time to which the Offer has been so extended, the " _Expiration Time_
").

 

(e) Subject to _Article_ __ _ 8_, Buyer may or shall, as applicable, extend
the Offer from time to time as follows:

 

(i) for the minimum period as required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the SEC, the staff thereof, the NASDAQ or the NYSE as
applicable to the Offer;

(ii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer
Conditions has not either been (A) satisfied or (B) waived by Buyer (to the
extent such waiver is not prohibited under this Agreement or applicable Law),
then Buyer shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive
periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such period to end at
5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or
such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent, Buyer and the Company) in
order to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Condition(s); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Buyer determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, the
Offer Condition set forth in  _paragraph_ __ _ (B)_ of _Annex_ __ _ I_ is
not reasonably likely to be satisfied within such ten (10) Business Day
extension period, then Buyer shall be permitted to extend the Offer on such
occasion for up to twenty (20) Business Days; _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that (x) Buyer shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date
later than the End Date (as the End Date may be extended pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_), (y) if the sole then-unsatisfied Offer Condition
is the Minimum Condition and the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling has been obtained
or it becomes apparent to Parent, in its reasonable judgment, that the Pre-
Wired Asset Sale Ruling will not be received, Buyer shall not be required to
extend the Offer on more than two (2) occasions in consecutive periods of
up to ten (10) Business Days each (with each such period to end at 5:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the last Business Day of such period) (or such other
duration as may be agreed to by Parent, Buyer and the Company) and (z) Buyer
shall not be required to extend the Offer at any time that Parent or Buyer is
permitted to terminate this Agreement; or

(iii) to such other date and time as may be agreed in writing by Parent and
the Company.

(f) Following the Acceptance Time, Buyer shall (and the Offer Documents shall
so indicate) provide a subsequent offering period (" _Subsequent Offering
Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated under 

 



14  the 1934 Act of not less than ten (10) Business Days (calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the 1934 Act). In the
event that prior to the expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period, Buyer or
one of its Affiliates has elected to exercise the Call Option or effectuate
the Asset Sale, Buyer shall (and the Offer Documents shall so indicate) extend
the Subsequent Offering Period for at least five (5) Business Days to permit
any remaining Minority Shareholders to tender their Shares in exchange for the
Offer Consideration (such extension, the " _Minority Exit Offering Period_
"). 

(g) The Offer may not be terminated prior to the Initial Expiration Time or
the then-scheduled Expiration Time (as the same may be extended pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(e)_) unless this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to)
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following such valid
termination) terminate the Offer and not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto.
If the Offer is terminated in accordance with this Agreement by Parent prior
to the acceptance for payment and payment for Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer, Buyer shall (and Parent shall cause Buyer to) promptly return, and
shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Buyer to return, in accordance
with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.01(g)_ shall affect any termination rights
under  _Article_ __ _ 8_.

(h) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Buyer
shall (i) cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ TO_"), which
shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal and other appropriate ancillary offer documents required
to be included therein (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ")
and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to
the extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws and
any other applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Buyer all information concerning the Company required by the 1934 Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become (or shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case to the extent required by applicable United States federal securities
Laws and any other applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and
Parent and Buyer shall cause to be included in such document (and any
amendments thereto) all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and its
counsel. Parent and Buyer shall provide the Company and its counsel with (A)
any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Buyer or
its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff or other
Governmental Authorities with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and
(B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and
Buyer to those comments and to provide comments on that response (which
response shall include all comments reasonably proposed by the Company and its
counsel), including by participating with Parent and Buyer or their counsel
in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or other Governmental Authorities
to the extent such participation is not prohibited by the SEC or other
Governmental Authorities.

 

Section 2.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and the other
Signing Transactions. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date) furnish Parent
and Buyer with (i) a list of its shareholders and mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares, (ii) any
available listing and computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories and

 



15  (iii) copies of all lists of shareholders, security position listings and
computer files in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Shares, in each case, true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall provide to Parent and Buyer such additional
information (including updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels and lists
of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent or Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In the event that the Company
is prohibited from providing any such information, (A) it shall request
permission from the applicable shareholders to provide such information to
Parent and Buyer or (B) if the information requested is not received at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
deliver to such shareholders all information that would otherwise be
required to be provided by Parent or Buyer to such shareholders of the
Company in connection with the Offer, and, notwithstanding this _Article_ __ _
2_, neither Parent nor Buyer shall have any obligation to deliver such
information to such shareholders under this Agreement. Except as required by
applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, (i)
Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives shall hold in confidence the
information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Transactions and (ii) if this
Agreement is terminated, Parent and Buyer shall deliver to the Company and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates and
Representatives to deliver to the Company all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession.

 

(b) On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall, concurrently with the
filing of the Schedule TO, file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable United States
federal securities Laws and any other applicable Law, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ 14D_ _-9_ ") that, subject to  __ _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_,
shall reflect the Company Recommendation. Parent and Buyer shall cause to be
promptly furnished to the Company all information concerning Parent, Buyer or
any of their applicable Affiliates required by the 1934 Act to be set forth
in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Buyer, on the other hand, agrees promptly to correct any information provided
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that it shall have become (or shall have become known to be)
false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by applicable United States federal securities Laws and any
other applicable Law. Parent, Buyer and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time
before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall include in such
document (and any amendments thereto) all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent, Buyer and their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Buyer and
their counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written
or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff or other Governmental Authorities with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(which response shall include all comments reasonably proposed by Parent,
Buyer and their counsel), including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC or other Governmental
Authorities to the extent such participation is not prohibited by the SEC or
other Governmental Authorities.

Section 2.03  _Outstanding Equity Awards_.

(a) _Vested Company RSUs_. At the Closing, each Company RSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and either (i) held by a
Person other than a Continuing Employee, whether vested or unvested, (ii)
vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and
award agreement evidencing such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the
Closing and for which Company Shares have not yet been issued, (iii) that, in
the absence of the Transactions, would become vested within two years
following the Closing and are held by a Continuing Employee whose employment
or service with the Company commenced prior to the date of this Agreement or
(iv) is subject to accelerated vesting solely as a result of the

 



16  completion of the Transactions in accordance with the terms thereof (each, a
" _Terminating RSU_ "), will, without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer,
the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be accelerated (if
required) and converted into and will become a right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Offer Consideration by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
RSU. Any such payment with respect to a Terminating RSU shall be subject to
all applicable federal, state and local tax withholding requirements.

 

(b) _Unvested Company RSUs_. At the Closing, each Company RSU that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and not covered by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be converted into
an equity award subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to
such Company RSU (including the same vesting schedule and terms regarding
acceleration and forfeiture upon termination of employment or service)
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to a number of shares of common
stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of Parent equal to (i) the
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Closing
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Equity Award Adjustment Ratio_ " shall mean (x) the Offer
Consideration divided by (y) the average closing price of the common stock of
Parent on the NASDAQ for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately preceding the date of the Closing; _provided_ , that
all references to the "Company" in all applicable Company Equity Plans and any
applicable award agreements governing Company RSUs shall be deemed to be
references to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that the terms and conditions
applicable to certain of such Company RSUs will be modified as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_ of the Company Letter.

 

(c) _Vested Company Options_. At the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and either (i) held by a
Person other than a Continuing Employee, whether vested or unvested, (ii) held
by a Person listed in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)(ii)_ of the Company Letter,
whether vested or unvested, (iii) vested in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Equity Plan and award agreement evidencing such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Closing, (iv) that, in the absence of
the Transactions, would become vested within two years following the Closing
and are held by a Continuing Employee whose employment or service with the
Company commenced prior to the date of this Agreement or (v) is subject to
accelerated vesting solely as a result of the completion of the Transactions
in accordance with the terms thereof (each, a " _Terminating Option_ "), will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Buyer, the Company, the holder
thereof or any other Person, be accelerated (if required) and converted into
and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Consideration over the
applicable per Share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied by (y)
the number of Shares subject to such Company Option. Each Terminating Option
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Closing that has
an exercise price equal to or greater than the Offer Consideration shall be
cancelled as of the Closing without consideration therefor and the holder of
such Terminating Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.
Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents of any holders of any Company Option
described in _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ through _(iv)_ of the preceding sentence
necessary to effectuate the treatment of such Company Options as described in
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_. Any such payment with respect to a
Terminating Option shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local
tax withholding requirements.

 

(d) _Unvested Company Options_. At the Closing, each Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing and that is not covered by
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be converted into
an option to purchase, subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to
such Company Option (including the same vesting schedule and terms regarding
acceleration and forfeiture upon termination of employment or service)
immediately prior to the Closing, a number of shares of common stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of Parent equal to (w) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Closing _multiplied
by_ (x) the Equity Award Adjustment Ratio, with an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the exercise price per
Share for which such Company Option was exercisable

 



17  immediately prior to the Closing _divided by_ (z) the Equity Award
Adjustment Ratio; _provided_ , that all references to the "Company" in the
applicable Company Equity Plan and all applicable award agreements governing
Company Options shall be deemed to be references to Parent; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the terms and conditions applicable to certain of such
Company Options will be modified as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(d)_ of
the Company Letter. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the
extent applicable, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent
common stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and,
in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies,
the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent common stock
purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code.

 

(e) The payments in respect of Company Equity Awards described in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03_ will be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.10_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) with respect to any
Company Equity Award that constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that payment of the
amounts described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ would otherwise cause the
imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment
shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Company Equity Plan and applicable award agreement that will not result in the
imposition of such Tax or penalty and (ii) with respect to Company Equity
Awards held by individuals subject to Taxes imposed by the Laws of a country
other than the United States, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith prior
to the Closing with the goal of minimizing the Tax impact of the provisions
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (but no later than the
Companys second payroll date after the Closing), the applicable holders of
vested Company Equity Awards will receive the payments described in _Section_
__ _ 2.03(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_ from the Company or
its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate (which amounts Buyer shall deposit or
cause to be deposited, to the extent that the Companys (or its applicable
Subsidiarys or Affiliates) cash as of the Closing is insufficient to fund
the payment of such amounts, with the Company or its applicable Subsidiary or
Affiliate, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, at or promptly
following the Closing), through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all
amounts required to be paid to such holders in respect of such vested Company
Equity Awards that are converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment
owed to a holder of such a vested Company Equity Award cannot be made through
the Companys (or its applicable Subsidiarys or Affiliates) payroll system
or payroll provider, then the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary or
Affiliate) will issue a check for such payment to such holder promptly
following the Closing Date.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) any payments to the holders of Section 102
Shares, Section 102 RSUs or Section 102 Options, shall not be paid directly to
the holders of such securities but shall be paid to the Section 102 Trustee
and distributed by the Section 102 Trustee, subject to Tax withholding and in
accordance with the Israel Equity Tax Ruling and the Interim Israel Equity Tax
Ruling, if obtained, and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof, and
(ii) Parent and Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary
to maintain a qualified equity incentive plan under Section 102, and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all equity awards of
Buyer or its Affiliate into which unvested Company Equity Awards subject to
Section 102 are converted pursuant to the above provisions shall also qualify
for capital gains track treatment under Section 102. 

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Closing, the Company, the Company Board and the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_
"), as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and amendments as may be
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_.
Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
provide that the Company will not be required to deliver Shares or other
shares in the share capital of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Equity Awards after the Closing; _provided_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, that (i) the Company shall only be required to
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any applicable consents
or acknowledgements from the holders of any Company

 



18  Equity Awards that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
sentence and (ii) in no event shall the Companys failure to obtain any such
consents or acknowledgements after using such commercially reasonable efforts
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.

(i) At the Closing, Buyer shall (or Parent shall cause one of its Affiliates
to) assume the Company Equity Plan and all obligations of the Company under
the Company Equity Plan. The agreements evidencing any Company Equity Award
that is converted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_). Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
common stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of such assumed awards.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, to the extent necessary,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent common stock
underlying such assumed awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such assumed awards remain outstanding. For
the avoidance of doubt, any Company Equity Award that is subject to the
requirements of Section 102 and assumed by Buyer or its Affiliate pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ shall continue to be governed by the terms and
conditions of Section 102 and shall be deposited with or be subject to the
supervision of the Section 102 Trustee.

Section 2.04 _Extraordinary General Meeting_.

(a) No later than ten (10) weeks following the Offer Commencement Date, the
Company shall hold an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders (the
" _EGM_ ") to:

(i) provide information regarding the Offer;

 

(ii) adopt one or more resolutions effective upon the Acceptance Time to
provide discharge to each member of the Company Board for their acts of
management or supervision, as applicable, up to the date of the EGM;
_provided_ , that such discharge will be limited to the extent provided by
general principles of Dutch law as in effect from time to time, and
the shareholders circular distributed to shareholders of the Company shall
refer to such limitation in general terms, consistent with the discussion of
discharge of directors of the Company that has been included in past
shareholders circulars;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that (x) if
Buyer or Parent, or any of their Affiliates, becomes a shareholder of the
Company, neither they, nor any of their successors or assigns, shall,
regardless of the scope of the discharge granted to directors by any
Discharge Resolution, assert any claim for liability against the directors in
office immediately prior to the EGM (or, if new directors are elected after
the EGM but prior to the Closing, against such directors), based on (A) acts
or omissions of directors described in any information which is disclosed to
Buyer or Parent in this Agreement, in the Company Letter or any information
set forth in any Company SEC Document filed or furnished on or after December
31, 2014 and publicly available at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
date of this Agreement (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set
forth in any "risk factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward-looking
statements" section and any other disclosures included therein to the extent
they are predictive or forward-looking in nature, it being understood that any
factual information contained within such sections shall not be excluded) or
(B) any acts or omissions of directors of the Company prior to the Closing
(or, in the case of Independent Directors, after the Closing) which are
required to be taken under this Agreement; and (y) for the avoidance
of doubt, the adoption of a Discharge Resolution shall be in addition to, and
shall not in any way adversely affect, or limit in any way, the effect of any
discharge of directors, or of members of the Companys former Supervisory
Board, adopted prior to the shareholders meeting at which such Discharge
Resolution is adopted (as used in this Agreement, the term " _Discharge
Resolution_ " shall mean any resolution for the discharge of directors adopted
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)(ii)_ or as provided in _Section_ __
_ 2.05(e)_);

(iii) adopt one or more resolutions effective upon the Closing to appoint the
Buyer Directors, and the Independent Directors (if such Independent Directors
are not already members of the Company

 



19  Board), to replace the members of the Company Board who will resign at
Closing (the " _Governance Resolutions_ ");

 

(iv) adopt one or more resolutions (jointly, the " _Conversion Resolutions_ ")
to amend the articles of association of the Company substantially in
accordance with the drafts of the amended articles of association attached as

Association of the Company after Closing), which includes the conversion of
the Company into a private limited liability company ( _besloten_
___vennootschap_ _met_ _beperkte_ ___aansprakelijkheid_ ) and which shall be
executed and become effective as soon as practicable following Closing if
elected by Buyer; and (B) _Schedule 2.04(a)(iv)(B)_ (Amended Articles of
Association of the Company after Delisting), which shall be executed and
become effective as soon as practicable following the delisting of the
Company and the Shares from NYSE;

(v) adopt a resolution to, subject to (A) the Acceptance Time having
occurred, (B) the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling having been received and (C) the
number of Shares validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer
(including Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period, as it may
be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period) and not properly withdrawn,
together with the Shares owned by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, representing
at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Companys issued capital (
_geplaatst_ ___kapitaal_ ) (the " _Asset Sale Threshold_ "), approve the asset
sale as contemplated by the Asset Sale Documentation (the " _Asset Sale_ ") as
required under Section 2:107a of the DCC;

(vi) adopt a resolution to, subject to (A) the Acceptance Time having
occurred, (B) the Asset Sale Threshold having been achieved and (C) the Asset
Sale having been completed, (1) dissolve ( _ontbinden_ ) the Company in
accordance with Section 2:19 of the DCC and (2) appoint as liquidator (the "
_Liquidator_ ") a foundation ( _stichting_ ) to be incorporated under Dutch
Law and approve reimbursement of the Liquidators reasonable salary and costs
(provided that such reimbursement will be subject to the approval of
the Independent Directors, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and (3) appoint an Affiliate of Buyer as the custodian of the books
and records of the Company in accordance with Section 2:24 of the DCC ( _sub-
clauses_ __ _ (v)_ and _(vi)_ together, the " _Pre-Wired Asset Sale
Resolutions_"); and

 

(vii) conduct such other business as may properly come before the meeting.

 

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare a
notice of meeting and shareholders circular for the EGM (together with any
amendments and supplements thereto and any other documents required, the "
_EGM Materials_ ") relating to the matters set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.04(a)_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_, the Company shall include the
Company Recommendation in the EGM Materials. Parent and Buyer shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent, Buyer and any of
their Affiliates required to be set forth in the EGM Materials. The Company
shall provide Parent, Buyer and their counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the EGM Materials (and any amendments thereto) each time
prior to dissemination to the shareholders of the Company and the Company
shall include in the EGM Materials all comments reasonably proposed by
Parent, Buyer and their counsel. The Company shall provide Parent, Buyer and
their counsel, to the extent not prohibited under applicable Law, with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from Governmental Authorities
with respect to the EGM Materials promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(which response shall include all comments reasonably proposed by Parent,
Buyer and their counsel), including by participating with the Company or its
counsel in any discussions or meetings with Governmental Authorities to the
extent such participation is not prohibited by the applicable Governmental
Authority.

 

(c) The Company shall consult with Parent and Buyer regarding the date of the
EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) and, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, shall not cancel the

 



20  EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) without the prior written consent of Parent and
Buyer; _provided_ , that the Company may, on no more than one (1) occasion,
following reasonable consultation with Parent and Buyer, and, to the extent
requested in writing by Parent and Buyer, the Company shall, cancel and
reconvene the EGM (or any Subsequent EGM) solely to the extent reasonably
necessary (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the relevant EGM
Materials that the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel,
reasonably determines is necessary to comply with applicable Law is made
available to the Companys shareholders in advance of the EGM (and
any Subsequent EGM) or (ii) to solicit additional proxies in favor of
approval of the matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_. In the event
the EGM or any Subsequent EGM is cancelled and reconvened pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall duly give notice of and reconvene the
EGM or such Subsequent EGM on a date scheduled by mutual agreement of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, acting
reasonably, or, in the absence of such agreement, as soon as practicable
following the date of such cancellation but, in any event, no later than the
day that is thirty-five (35) days following the date of such cancellation (or,
in the case of any Subsequent EGM, a date that shall be prior to the date of
the Expiration Time).

(d) The Company shall ensure that the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Law. The approval of the matters set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_ shall be the only matters that the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the EGM (and any
Subsequent EGM), unless otherwise reasonably proposed by the Company and
approved in advance in writing by Parent and Buyer (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the EGM or any Subsequent EGM is combined with the 2017 and 2018 annual
general meetings of shareholders of the Company, the shareholders may also
consider at such meeting such other matters as have typically been included
on the agenda for annual general meetings of shareholders of the Company in
past years, subject to reasonable discussion among the Parties.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that, at the EGM, the Governance Resolutions, the Pre-Wired Asset Sale
Resolutions or the Conversion Resolutions have not been adopted, or if the
Company Board shall determine in its reasonable judgement that any additional
shareholders resolutions should be adopted in order to approve any of the
Signing Transactions, then, in each case, the Company shall, following
consultation with Parent and Buyer, duly call and give notice of another EGM
(a " _Subsequent EGM_ "), which shall take place at a date reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Buyer and not later than a date that shall be prior
to the date of the Expiration Time at which the Governance Resolutions, the
Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions or the Conversion Resolutions, or the
additional resolutions as referred to above, as applicable, shall be
considered or reconsidered, as the case may be.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to the
Companys rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 8.01_, the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM) in accordance with and
subject to the terms hereof and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_, in each case, shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to a vote
of the shareholders of the Company any Alternative Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal) or any matters relating thereto.

(g) At and prior to the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM), the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the approval of the matters set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_.

Section 2.05  _Directors_.

(a) Parent, Buyer and the Company, including the Company Board and each of the
directors on the Company Board, shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts, including through their (vote in favor of any) nomination or
appointment of any person to the Company Board and their (vote in favor of
any) resignation from 

 



21  the Company Board, to ensure that the Company Board will, upon the Closing,
be composed of at least seven (7) directors, (i) at least five (5) of whom may
not be independent of Buyer and the Company (the " _Buyer Directors_ ") and
who will be designated in writing, in Buyers sole discretion, as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event prior to convening the EGM, and (ii)
at least two (2) of whom will initially be current non-executive directors of
the Company (if and to the extent that they shall agree to continue to serve
on the Company Board after the Closing), and who will at all times be
independent from Parent and Buyer; _provided_ that, if and to the extent that
the current non-executive directors of the Company do not agree to serve on
the Company Board after the Closing, Buyer shall designate replacement
directors who shall at all times be independent from Parent and Buyer, as
promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to convening the EGM
(the directors so designated, and any present non-executive directors who
continue to serve on the Company Board after the Closing, are referred to
herein as the " _Independent Directors_ "). If required or desirable in order
to obtain the Israel Tax Rulings (as determined jointly by the Company and
Parent acting reasonably and in good faith), the Buyer Directors (other than
the executive directors of the Company) will not be residents of Israel.

 

(b) Each Independent Director shall resign from, and the Company shall take
such other action necessary to ensure that each such Independent Director
ceases to be a director of, the Company Board upon the earliest to occur of
(i) such time after the Acceptance Time as Buyer and its Affiliates, in the
aggregate, own one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
Shares and (ii) the Second Step Distribution being paid in full and
completion of the subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the Company (the "
_Liquidation_ ").

 

(c) If, at any time, an Independent Director resigns from, or otherwise ceases
to be a member of, the Company Board, or ceases to be independent from Parent
and Buyer, in each case, prior to the date of resignation contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.05(b)_, Parent shall procure that the respective Independent
Director will be replaced after the Closing by a new director who is
independent from Parent and Buyer.

(d) Parent and Buyer shall supply to the Company in writing any information
regarding the Buyer Directors, and (to the extent applicable) those
Independent Directors designated by Buyer, as required by applicable Laws in
connection with the appointment of the Buyer Directors, and (to the extent
applicable) those Independent Directors designated by Buyer, to the Company
Board, and Parent and Buyer shall be solely responsible for any such
information.

(e) In addition to the discharge contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.04(a)(ii)_, Buyer shall (i) at the first annual or extraordinary general
meeting of shareholders of the Company held after the Closing, cause all
members of the Company Board resigning effective upon the Acceptance Time to
be fully and finally discharged for their acts of management or supervision,
as applicable and (ii) at the first annual or extraordinary general meeting of
shareholders of the Company held after the resignation of an Independent
Director, cause such Independent Director to be fully and finally discharged
for his or her acts of supervision; _provided_ , that such discharge will be
limited to the extent provided by general principles of Dutch law as in
effect from time to time, and the shareholders circular distributed to
shareholders of the Company relating to the meeting at which a Discharge
Resolution is proposed to be adopted shall refer to such limitation in general
terms, consistent with the discussion of discharge of directors of the
Company that has been included in shareholders circulars prior to the date of
this Agreement. The proviso to _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a_ _)(_ _ii)_ shall also
be applicable _mutatis mutandis_ , to any discharge granted to directors
pursuant to the preceding sentence.

(f) Notwithstanding any other required vote, the affirmative vote of the
Independent Directors will also be required for approving:

(i) any restructuring that could reasonably be expected to lead to a dilution
of the shareholdings of the Minority Shareholders, other than (A) pursuant to
a rights issue by the Company or any other share issue where the Minority
Shareholders have been offered an opportunity to subscribe pro rata in
accordance with their then existing shareholding in the Company (
_voorkeursrecht_ ), (B) subject to

 



22  receipt of the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling, the Asset Sale, the Second Step
Distribution or the Liquidation, (C) the Compulsory Acquisition or (D) the
Call Option; and

(ii) any other form of unequal treatment that prejudices or could reasonably
be expected to prejudice or negatively affect the value of the Shares or
voting rights attached to the Shares held by the Minority Shareholders, but in
any event not including (A) subject to receipt of the Pre-Wired Asset Sale
Ruling, the Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution or the Liquidation, (B)
the Compulsory Acquisition or (C) the Call Option.

 

Section 2.06 _Further Actions_. If requested by the other party, the Company,
on the one hand, or Parent or Buyer, on the other hand, as applicable, shall
take, as of the date of this Agreement or as soon thereafter as is reasonably
practicable, the following actions to the extent reasonably necessary or
desirable to implement, commence, consummate or otherwise effect the Asset
Sale, the Liquidation and the Second Step Distribution (to the extent any
such actions, transactions or matters are elected to be effectuated by Parent
or Buyer), as the case may be:

 

(a) in the case of the Company, (i) the convening of the necessary meetings of

approval of any applicable resolutions of the Company Board or any committee
thereof as necessary or desirable to convene the EGM (and any Subsequent EGM)

2.07_; and

(a) As promptly as practicable following the closing of the Subsequent
Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period,

Buyers election, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall effectuate, a
corporate reorganization (the " _Post-Offer Reorganization_") of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, which, at Parents or Buyers election ( _provided_ that

(xi) a sale and transfer of assets and Liabilities (A) by the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company to Buyer, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent or (B)

year.

 

Section 2.08 _Call Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Buyer an irrevocable option (the " _Call
Option_ ") to purchase such number of newly issued ordinary shares, par value
0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Ordinary Shares_ "), within the limits of
the Companys authorized but unissued share capital at the time of issuance,
so as to increase Buyers ownership of Ordinary Shares by fifteen percent
(15%) of the total ownership of Ordinary Shares by all Persons, after giving
effect to the exercise in full of the Call Option (in the aggregate, the "
_Option Shares_ "), in exchange for an amount per Ordinary Share equal to the
Offer Consideration.

(b) The Call Option shall be exercisable following the Acceptance Time
once, in whole or in part, no later than the last day of the Subsequent
Offering Period (including any Minority Exit Offering Period, if applicable);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Call Option shall terminate concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the
event that Buyer wishes to exercise the Call Option, Buyer shall so notify the
Company in writing (the " _Option Exercise Notice_ "), and shall set forth in
such Option Exercise Notice (i) the total number of Option Shares and
percentage of total Ordinary Shares to be purchased by Buyer pursuant to the
exercise of the Call Option and (ii) a place and date which shall be a
Business Day not earlier than three (3) Business Days and not later than
thirty (30) Business Days from the date the Company is notified of the
exercise of the Call Option for the closing of the purchase of the Option
Shares (such date, the " _Option Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , that if a
closing of the purchase and sale of any Option Shares pursuant to the exercise
of the Call Option (the " _Option Closing_ ") cannot be consummated, in the
reasonable opinion of Parent, by reason of any applicable Legal Restraint,
the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall
run instead from the date on which such restriction on consummation has
expired or been terminated; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , without limiting
the foregoing, that if, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, prior
notification to or the approval of any Governmental Authority is required in
connection with such purchase, the relevant Party shall promptly,
in consultation with each of the other Parties (but subject in all cases to
Parents final approval, in its sole discretion, of any such notice or
application), file the required notice or application for approval and shall
expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would
run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any
required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such
approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods
shall have passed.

 



25 (c) At the Option Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company
the aggregate purchase price for the number of Option Shares described in the
relevant Option Exercise Notice and purchased pursuant to the exercise of the
Call Option by:

 

(i) wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated
at least three (3) Business Days in advance in writing to Parent and Buyer by
the Company; _provided_ , that failure or refusal of the Company to designate
such a bank account shall not preclude Buyer from exercising the Call Option;

 

(ii) issuance by Buyer to the Company of a promissory note in favor of the
Company containing the terms set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 2.08(c)(ii)_,
guaranteed by Parent or a creditworthy Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Buyer Note_
");

 

(iii) contribution in kind ( _inbreng_ _in_ _natura_ ) in accordance with
Section 2:94b or (if applicable) 2:204b of the DCC by Buyer to the Company by
way of the assignment by Buyer to the Company of a promissory note issued by
Parent or a creditworthy Subsidiary of Parent in favor of Buyer containing the
terms set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 2.08(c_ _)(_ _iii)_ (a " _Parent Note_
"); or

(iv) any combination of the foregoing.

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may exercise any of the foregoing options
described above in _clauses (i)_ through  _(iv)_ at its sole discretion,
provided that the aggregate nominal value of the Option Shares must (except in
the event of the exercise of the payment option described in _clause_ __ _
(iii)_, above) in any event be paid in the manner set forth in _clause_ __ _
(i)_ above, and subject in all cases to compliance with mandatory provisions
of Dutch Law as set forth in _clauses_ __ _ (1)_ and _(2)_ below:

 

(1) To the extent that Buyer elects to pay for the Option Shares by issuance
of a Buyer Note, the Option Shares issued to Buyer will be deemed to
constitute partly paid shares ( _niet volgestorte aandelen_ ), and the Company
shall comply with the relevant provisions of the DCC relating to partly paid
shares, including (A) the making of any relevant informational filings with
the Trade Register and (B) making the notations in the Companys shareholders
register relating to the Option Shares available for inspection by the public
generally; and

 

(2) To the extent that Buyer elects to pay for the Option Shares by
contribution of a Parent Note to the Company, (A) the Company Board will,
prior to the issuance of the Option Shares, prepare a description (
_beschrijving_ ) of the Parent Note, signed by all of the members of the
Company Board, pursuant to Section 2:94b of the DCC or, if
applicable, Section 2:204b of the DCC, containing all of the information
required to be included therein by Dutch law, (B) Parent and Buyer will
procure the issuance, at their own expense, of an accountants statement (
_accountantsverklaring_ ) with respect to the contribution of the Parent Note
to the Company, if and to the extent required by Section 2:94b of the DCC (the
" _Accountants Statement_ ") and (C) the Company will provide reasonable
information and cooperation to Buyer, Parent and the accountants issuing the
Accountants Statement, to enable such accountants to issue the Accountants
Statement. If the provisions of this _paragraph_ __ _ (2)_ are applicable,
then the Company will not be obligated to issue the Option Shares to Buyer
until the Accountants Statement, if required by Dutch law, has been duly
issued by an accounting firm which is authorized to issue the Accountants
Statement pursuant to Section 2:94b of the DCC. 

(d) At the Option Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of payment as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.08(c)_:

 

(i) (A) the Company shall issue the Option Shares purchased by Buyer to Buyer,
and Buyer shall accept such Option Shares, by each of the Company and Buyer
executing a non-notarial (or, if required by Dutch law, notarial) deed of
issuance by and between the Company and Buyer in customary form and (B) the
Company shall record such issuance in the Companys shareholders register;
and

(ii) Buyer shall deliver to the Company a letter agreeing that Buyer will not
offer to sell or otherwise dispose of the Option Shares acquired by it at the
Option Closing in violation of applicable Law or the provisions of this

(other than for ordinary administrative expenses and routine claims for
benefits) under the terms of, or with respect to, such Company Plans; (iii)

material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither the
Company nor any Company Plan nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
trustee, administrator or other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-
interest thereof, has, with respect to any Company Plan, engaged in any breach
of fiduciary responsibility or any "prohibited transaction"

 



42  (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code) to which Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and
which would subject, or impose an indemnification obligation on, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates with respect to
the Tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the

(f) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.18(f)_ of the Company Letter,

under a Company Plan that would, individually or in combination with any other
such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code and the imposition of an excise tax on such Company
Service Provider under Section 4999 of the Code.

 

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, no Action (other than routine claims for
benefits) is pending against or involves or, to the knowledge of the Company,
is threatened against or threatened to involve, any Company Plan before any
Governmental Authority. No Company Plan is presently or has within the three

any obligation under any Company Plan or otherwise to compensate, gross-up or
indemnify any person for excise Taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code or for excise Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. Each
Company Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" (as such
term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is and has been in
compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code and all
applicable regulatory guidance (including proposed regulations, notices,
rulings and final regulations).

current or former Company Service Providers after retirement or other
termination of service (other than for continuation of coverage required under

States, (B) if required to be registered with or approved by a Governmental
Authority, has been registered or approved and has been maintained in good
standing with the applicable regulatory authorities, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval
or application therefor relating to any such Company Plan that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect

 



43  any such approval or good standing, (C) that is intended to qualify for
special Tax treatment meets all requirement for such treatment and (D) that is

during any inspection by Parent, Buyer or their respective Representatives
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_. No notice, access, review or
investigation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent, Buyer or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or otherwise shall
affect any representations or warranties of the Company or conditions or
rights of Parent and Buyer contained in this Agreement. No investigation after
the date of this Agreement shall affect or be deemed to modify or supplement
any representation or warranty made by the Company herein.

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of that certain letter agreement regarding
confidentiality, dated as of February 1, 2017, by and between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms following the Closing.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Buyer,
directly or indirectly, rights to control the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the Closing.

Section __ 5.03 _No Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Change_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors and officers not to, and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective Representatives not to, and shall not publicly announce any
intention to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate, knowingly induce or encourage (including by providing
information, cooperation or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than informing Persons of the
provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (iii) execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract (whether or not binding) with respect to an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and officers to, and
shall direct each of the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date of
this Agreement with respect to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal,
and shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive, release or assign, any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar
agreement) to which the Company or any of its

 



57  Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ ,
that the Company shall be permitted to release or waive any such standstill
obligations solely to the extent necessary to permit the party referenced
therein to submit an Alternative Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board on
a confidential basis conditioned upon such Person agreeing that the Company
shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent and Buyer
regarding any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) request each
Person that has prior to the date of this Agreement executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal to, in accordance with the terms of such agreement, return or destroy
all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this
Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it shall promptly inform
its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section_ __ _
5.03_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.03(a)_, in the event that the Company receives during the Pre-Closing
Period an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the
Company may take the following actions (but only if (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Company directors
fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands and (B) (1) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
and (2) the submission of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal did not
result from or arise in connection with a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.03_):

 

(i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group making such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any such non-public
information, it receives from such Person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality terms at least
as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and
which shall not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would
restrict, in any manner, the Companys ability to consummate the Transactions
or to comply with its disclosure obligations to Parent and Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) prior
to or contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to
such Person or group, it furnishes such non-public information to Parent or
Buyer to the extent Parent or Buyer has not previously been provided with
such information; and

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group with
respect to such Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  _Sections_ __
_ 5.03(a)_, _(b)_ and _(d)_ , as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information or any inquiry that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the
Company shall provide Parent and Buyer with written notice of the material
terms and conditions of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if not previously provided pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_. Commencing upon the provision of any notice
referred to above and continuing until such Alternative Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry is withdrawn, (i) the Company (or its outside legal
counsel) shall keep Parent and Buyer (or their outside legal counsel)
informed on a reasonably current basis regarding the status and terms (other
than immaterial terms) of discussions and negotiations relating to any such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry at the request of Parent
or Buyer and (ii) the Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours following the receipt or delivery
thereof), provide Parent and Buyer (or their outside legal counsel) with
unredacted copies of all written proposals or proposed transaction agreements
(including all schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent and Buyer
with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is
provided to the members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company

 



58  Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any
Alternative Acquisition Proposal. Any material amendment (including the form,
amount and timing of payment of consideration) to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal will be deemed to be a new Alternative Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_.

 

(d) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(e)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly:

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, the Company Recommendation or
fail to make, or include in the applicable Company Disclosure Documents, the
approval, adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board or any committee thereof of this Agreement, of the Offer or any
of the other Transactions, or make any public statement inconsistent with the
Company Recommendation; (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal; or (C)
publicly make any recommendation in connection with an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal other than a recommendation against such proposal (any action
described in this _clause_ __ _ (i)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar Contract (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (A) relating to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or any offer or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (B) requiring it (or that would
require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.03(d)_, solely in response to a Superior Proposal received by the Company
Board after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to the Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, validly
terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(i)_, or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such
action, only if all of the following conditions are met:

 

(i) the Company has not breached any of its obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 5.03_ (where such breach proximately caused such Superior Proposal
being received by the Company);

(ii) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent and Buyer four (4)
Business Days prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it
has received a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related
to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a new four (4) Business Day period)
and (3) that, subject to _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ below, the Company Board has
determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ in order to enter
into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to
making such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_, as applicable, to the extent
requested by Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
and Buyer during such four (4) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute
a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account

 



59  any revised terms proposed by Parent and Buyer, such Superior Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such
Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(i)_ would be inconsistent with the Company
directors fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.03(d)_, upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board
may, at any time prior to the Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, or authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such
action, only if all of the following conditions are met:

 

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent and Buyer four (4) Business
Days prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to _clause_ __ _
(ii)_ below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation
Change, to the extent requested by Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent and Buyer during such four (4) Business Day period
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Company Board
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event
in accordance with _clause_ __ _ (ii)_ below would no longer be inconsistent
with the Company directors fiduciary duties under the Laws of The
Netherlands; and

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent
and Buyer, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Company directors fiduciary duties under the
applicable Laws of The Netherlands.

(g) Unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to  _Article_ __ _
8_, neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall
take any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "business
combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or
similar Law inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
1934 Act (or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ , that
any such disclosure shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

Section 5.04 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
will take all steps that may be required, necessary or advisable to cause
each Company Plan or similar arrangement that has been or, after the date of
this Agreement, will be entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with any of its directors, officers or employees pursuant to which
consideration is payable to any director, officer or employee to be approved
by the Compensation Committee as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
promulgated under the 1934 Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the 1934
Act. At the time of the taking of such steps described in this _Section_ __ _
5.04_, the Compensation Committee will be composed solely of "independent
directors" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) promulgated under the 1934
Act and the instructions thereto.

 

Section 5.05 _Israel Tax Rulings_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company, in consultation with Parent and Buyer, shall prepare and file
with the ITA applications for rulings in form and

 



60  substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and Buyer confirming: (i) that
Parent shall be exempt from withholding Tax in relation to payments made under
this Agreement in connection with Company Equity Awards made under Section
102; (ii) that the payment of any consideration for vested Company Equity
Awards subject to Section 102 will not constitute a violation of Section 102
requirements for capital gains track treatment of such awards as long as such
consideration is deposited with the Section 102 Trustee; (iii) that the
conversion of unvested Company Equity Awards subject to Section 102 into
equity awards of Buyer or its Affiliates will not constitute a violation of
Section 102 requirements for capital gains track treatment of such awards as
long as such awards of Buyer or its Affiliates shall be deposited with, or be
maintained under the supervision of, the Section 102 Trustee, and that
capital gains track treatment shall continue to apply under Section 102 to
such awards of Buyer or its Affiliates; and (iv) that the Israeli taxation
will be deferred until completion of the statutory holding period and release
of such cash consideration or converted Company Equity Awards, as applicable,
provided that such consideration and awards are deposited with the Section 102
Trustee for the duration of the statutory holding period (which ruling may
be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such rulings)
and any other issue which requires determination from the ITA (the " _Israel
Equity Tax Ruling_ ").

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company, in consultation with Parent and Buyer, shall prepare and file
with the ITA an application for a ruling in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Buyer that (i) with respect to holders of Shares who
are non-residents of Israel (as defined in the ITO or as will be determined
by the ITA), (A) exempting Buyer or Parent on Buyers behalf (or a paying
agent designated by Buyer) from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at the
source from any Offer Consideration, or clarifying that no such withholding
obligation exists, or (B) clearly instructing Buyer or Parent on Buyers
behalf (or a paying agent designated by Buyer) how such withholding at the
source is to be effected, and in particular, with respect to the classes or
categories of holders of Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the
rate or rates of withholding to be applied and how to identify any such non-
residents of Israel; and (ii) with respect to holders of Shares who are
residents of Israel (as defined in the ITO or as will be determined by the
ITA), (x) exempting Buyer or Parent on Buyers behalf (or a paying agent
designated by Buyer) from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at the
source from any Offer Consideration, or clarifying that no such withholding
obligation exists, or (y) clearly instructing Buyer or Parent on Buyers
behalf (or a paying agent designated by Buyer) how such withholding at the
source is to be effected, and in particular, with respect to the classes or
categories of holders of the Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any),
the rate or rates of withholding to be applied (the " _Withholding
Tax Ruling_ "), such ruling to be in form and substance to Parents
satisfaction.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company, in consultation with Parent and Buyer, shall prepare and file
with the ITA an application for a ruling or rulings in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Buyer that (i) exempts Parent, Buyer and
the Company from Israeli Tax with respect to the Asset Sale (as contemplated
by the Asset Sale Documentation) the Second Step Distribution and the
Liquidation, taking into account all relevant related steps (including the
conversion of the Company from a _Naamloze Vennootschap_ to a _Besloten
Vennootschap_ _met Beperkte Aansprakelijkheid_ following the Asset Sale) and
(ii) the Asset Sale will not adversely affect the remaining duration or the
extent of the incentives available to the Company and its Subsidiaries
resulting from the status of a Preferred Enterprise and/or Benefitted
Enterprise under Israels Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment,
1959 or require any recapture of any previously claimed incentive, and the
entitlement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such incentive
shall be preserved despite the Asset Sale ( _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ and _(ii)_
together, the " _Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling_" and, together with the
Withholding Tax Ruling, the Israel Equity Tax Ruling and any other Israeli Tax
ruling that may be required in connection with the Post-Offer Reorganization,
the " _Israel Tax Rulings_ "), such ruling to be in form and substance to
Parents satisfaction.

(d) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall cause their respective Israeli counsel to coordinate all
activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation
and filing of such applications and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be

 



61  necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israel Tax Rulings. The Company
shall use all reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken,
all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Law to obtain the Israel Tax Rulings as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company and its
Representatives shall not make any application to, or conduct any negotiation
with, the ITA with respect to any matter relating to any of the Israel Tax
Rulings without prior coordination and consultation with Parent and Buyer or
their respective Representatives, and will enable Parents and
Buyers Representatives to participate in all discussions and meetings
relating thereto (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all
discussions and meetings with the ITA) to the maximum extent permitted by law.
To the extent that Parents and Buyers Representatives elect not to
participate in any meeting or discussion, or shall be prohibited from doing
so, the Companys Representatives shall provide a prompt and full report of
the discussions held. In any event, the final text of each of the Israel Tax
Rulings shall in all circumstances be subject to the prior written consent of
Parent and Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Without derogating from the foregoing, should
any meeting be held with the ITA at which Parents Israeli counsel does not
attend, Companys counsel shall provide Parent and its Israeli counsel with an
update of such meeting or discussion within one (1) Business Day of such
meeting or discussion.

(e) In the event that it becomes apparent that the Israel Equity Tax Ruling
will not be received prior to Closing, the Company shall cause the Israeli
Subsidiary to obtain prior to the Closing an interim Tax ruling confirming
that the Closing shall not adversely affect the Tax status or trigger Israeli
withholding Tax requirements with respect to any payments or exchanges made
with respect to Company Equity Awards subject to Section 102 (which ruling may
be subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling)
(the " _Interim Israel Equity Tax Ruling_ ").

 

Section 5.06 _Delisting_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and Buyer and use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and
the Shares from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Closing and the
deregistration of the Shares under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable
after such delisting.

 

Section 5.07 _Anti-Takeover Measures_. The Company and the Company Board (and
any applicable committees thereof) shall take all actions within their power
and authority necessary so that no Anti-Takeover Measure is or becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions. If any Anti-Takeover Measure becomes
applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company and the Company Board (and
any applicable committees thereof) shall grant such approvals and take such
actions within their power and authority as are necessary so that any such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act within their power and
authority to eliminate such Anti-Takeover Measures in respect of such
Transactions.

Section 5.08  _Asset Sale and Liquidation_. To the extent any such actions,
transactions or matters are validly elected to be effectuated by Parent or
Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ _(_ _a)_ , but subject in the case of
the Asset Sale, Liquidation and Second Step Distribution to the prior receipt
of the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling, the Company shall take all such steps and
do all such things as are reasonably required to procure that the Asset Sale,
Liquidation and Second Step Distribution timely occur.

ARTICLE 6

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND BUYER

 

Parent and Buyer jointly and severally agree that:

 

Section 6.01 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries

 



62  (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing and in connection with (i) the Signing
Transactions, (ii) the Asset Sale, Liquidation and Second Step Distribution
and (iii) the Tender and Support Agreements, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law or to the extent provided under the Company
Organizational Documents. In the event that any Indemnified Person is made
party to any Action arising out of or relating to matters that would be
indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent, Buyer
and the Company shall advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Action, subject to
the execution by such Indemnified Person of appropriate undertakings to
repay such advanced fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, in each case
except to the extent prohibited under applicable Law. For a period of six (6)
years following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in
effect immediately prior to the Closing between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Person (the " _Indemnification Agreements_
"). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Parent
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cause the articles of
association and rules and regulations of the Company Board (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to exculpation of Liability of all
Indemnified Persons, indemnification of all Indemnified Persons and
advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous in the
aggregate to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
currently contained in the Company Organizational Documents. To the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification and exculpation shall
be mandatory rather than permissive.

 

(b) Parent shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, effective as of the Closing,
a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years after the
Closing with respect to directors and officers Liability insurance covering
each Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
Liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the
Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior
to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the total cost for such
prepaid "tail" insurance policy exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy
exceeds the Premium Cap, then Parent may obtain, or cause to be obtained, a
prepaid "tail" policy with the maximum coverage available for a total cost of
the Premium Cap. If Parent for any reason fails to cause to be obtained such
"tail" insurance policy as of the Closing, Parent shall continue, or cause to
be continued, to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Closing, the directors and officers Liability insurance
in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current directors and officers Liability insurance carrier.

(c) If Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties or assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent or Buyer,
as applicable, shall take such action as may be necessary so that such Person
shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 6.01_.

(d) Each of the Indemnified Persons is intended to be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ with full rights of enforcement as
if a party hereto. The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_
__ _ 6.01_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of, any other
rights that such Persons may have under the Company Organizational Documents,
the Indemnification Agreements or applicable Law (whether at Law or in
equity).

 



63 Section 6.02 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, such shorter period of employment, as
the case may be), each Continuing Employee shall receive from Buyer (or its
applicable Affiliate) compensation (including, base salary and annual cash
bonus opportunity) that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to what
such Continuing Employee was entitled to immediately prior to the Closing
Date and benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either
those benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension
or retiree medical benefits) that are generally made available as of the date
of this Agreement by the Company to such employees or by Buyer to similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. This _Section_ __ _ 6.02(a)_
shall not apply to Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are governed by a collective bargaining, works council or similar
agreement. Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor the
terms of any written collective bargaining or similar agreements to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is bound.

(b) Any Continuing Employee who incurs a termination of employment during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date shall be entitled to receive the severance payments and
benefits that such Continuing Employee would have been entitled to receive
from the Company and its Affiliates under its applicable written severance
plans and policies, or individual employment agreements, as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and that have been made available to Buyer
and listed in  _Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)_ of the Company Letter in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.18(b)_.

 

(c) If requested by Buyer in writing within ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing, the Company
shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate each Company Plan
listed in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_ of the Company Letter (each, a "
_Terminated Plan_ "). The Company shall provide Buyer with a copy of the
resolutions and/or plan amendments (subject to reasonable advance review and
comment by Buyer) evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been terminated.

 

(d) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans (including paid time off but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan or for purposes of equity compensation
vesting) of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), to the extent
permitted under the terms of any applicable New Plan, each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Closing Date, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing
Date, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing Date, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent
permitted under the terms of any applicable New Plan, (i) each Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Closing Date (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing welfare benefits
(including medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits) to any
Continuing Employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(e) Notwithstanding the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and

_(C)_ without the prior written consent of Parent.

(h) In the event that any Action is commenced challenging the Transactions as
violating any Antitrust Law, each Party shall cooperate with each other Party

written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver or extension
is to be effective. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the
exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be
a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty

any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right.

 

Section 9.04 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to email (any such
delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version

Delivery

 



73  to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever

remedies; _provided_ , that: (a) the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ are

Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of

remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated, so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any material way. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable

sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other

other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right
of specific performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and

__ _ (D)_, shall continue to be true and correct (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company Material Adverse
Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the Expiration
Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such

whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, in
each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions
shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations
of Buyer to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Buyer at any time to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time. In addition, each of the foregoing conditions is
independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the exclusion of any
event from a particular condition does not mean that such event may not be
included in another condition.

_vennootschap_ ) organized under the Laws of The Netherlands (the " _Company_
") 
---|--- 
 

(together the " _Parties_ " and each also a " _Party_ ").

 

BACKGROUND:



   (A) | The Company, Buyer and Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
entered into that certain purchase agreement, dated March 12, 2017 (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Buyer has made a
recommended public offer (the " _Offer_ ") in cash for all the Shares in
exchange for an amount in cash equal to USD Sixty-Three Dollars and Fifty-Four
Cents ($63.54) per Share, without interest (the " _Offer Consideration_ "). 
---|--- 



   (B) | Pursuant to Section 2.04(a) of the Purchase Agreement and subject
to the terms and conditions set out therein, (i) the Company Board has
convened the EGM or a Subsequent EGM at which the Companys shareholders (the
" _Shareholders_ ") resolved to adopt the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement) in relation to the Transaction (as defined
below) and (ii) the Company Board has adopted a resolution to transfer the
Business to Buyer or one of Buyers Affiliates, if the Asset Sale Threshold is
met. 
---|--- 



   (C) | Buyer has notified the Company that it desires to acquire the
Business. 
---|--- 



   (D) | By and subject to this Agreement, the Company wishes to sell and
assign and/or transfer (as the case may be) and Buyer wishes to purchase and
accept or assume (as the case may be) the Business (the " _Asset Sale_ ") on
the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Agreement (the Asset
Sale together with the Liquidation, Second Step Distribution and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transaction_ "). 
---|--- 



   (E) | The Offer has been commenced, accepted for payment and closed and
paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   (F) | The Subsequent Offering Period has been completed, allowing
Shareholders another cash exit at the Offer Consideration. 
---|--- 



   (G) | Prior to the expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period, Buyer

Second Step Distribution and Liquidation. 
---|--- 
 



   (H) | Buyer has extended the Subsequent Offering Period in accordance
with Section 2.01(f) of the Purchase Agreement to permit any remaining
Minority Shareholders to tender their Shares in exchange for the Offer
Consideration in the Minority Exit Offering Period. 
---|--- 



   (I) | Buyer and the Company have agreed that following completion of
the Asset Sale, the Liquidation will become effective and result in the Second
Step Distribution. 
---|--- 
 



   (J) | Taking into consideration that: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions have been approved by
the EGM or a Subsequent EGM in accordance with Section 2.04 of the Purchase
Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the Closing has occurred and the Subsequent Offering Period
and the Minority Exit Offering Period have been completed;

is at or above the Asset Sale Threshold; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Buyer has requested the Company to execute and implement the
Asset Sale as contemplated in this Agreement and in accordance with Section
2.07(b) of the Purchase Agreement, 
---|---|---

subject to the conditions of this Agreement, effect (i) the Asset Sale and
(ii) the subsequent Liquidation resulting in the Second Step Distribution.



   (K) | The Parties wish to set forth in this Agreement their respective
rights and obligations in respect of the Transaction. 
---|--- 



   (L) | The Parties are entering into this transaction as a "second-step"
transaction following the successful completion of the Offer under the
Purchase Agreement (similar to a statutory merger in other jurisdictions) for
the purpose of business integration while simultaneously providing Minority
Shareholders (as hereinafter defined) the opportunity to exit from the Company
for the same per Share cash consideration that the Buyer has paid to
the other Shareholders in the Offer. 
---|--- 

IT IS AGREED as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

 

INTERPRETATION

 

Section 1.1 In addition to terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the
definitions and other provisions in _Schedule 8_  (Interpretation) apply
throughout this Agreement unless a different intention clearly appears.
Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement or in _Schedule 8_
(Interpretation) shall have the meaning given to such terms in the
Purchase Agreement.

Section 1.2 In this Agreement, unless a different intention clearly appears, a
reference to a Clause, Subclause or Schedule is a reference to a clause,
subclause or schedule of this Agreement. The Schedules are part of this
Agreement.

Section 1.3 The headings used in this Agreement shall not affect its
interpretation.

ARTICLE 2

 

SALE AND PURCHASE

 

Section 2.1 Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company hereby
sells and agrees to assign and/or transfer (as the case may be) to Buyer at
Completion and Buyer hereby purchases and agrees to accept and/or assume (as
the case may be) at Completion, the Business, with a view to Buyer carrying on
the Business from Completion as a going concern in succession to the
Company. 

Section 2.2 At Completion, all Assets, properties, Liabilities and Contracts
directly or indirectly used or required in connection with, or otherwise
related to, the Business will be transferred or assigned (as the case may be)
to Buyer.

 



2 Section 2.3 Subject to the Completion Conditions being satisfied or waived (in
whole or in part) in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, at Completion the economic benefit and risk of
the Business will pass to Buyer, without any carve-outs or exceptions (other
than expressly provided for in this Agreement).

ARTICLE 3

 

PURCHASE PRICE

 

Section 3.1 The Parties agree that the value of the Business is an amount
equal to the product of (i) the Offer Consideration multiplied by (ii) the
total number of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to Completion,
which shall be payable on Completion as follows:

 

(a) Of this value, an amount (the " _Cash Purchase Amount_ ") equal to the
product of (x) the Offer Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of
Shares held beneficially or of record by Shareholders other than Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (the " _Minority Shareholders_ ") shall be paid at
Completion in cash in accordance with  _Section 3.2_; _provided_ that at the
discretion of Buyer, Buyers obligation to pay the Cash Purchase Amount to the
Company may be set off against the Companys obligation to pay and deliver to
Buyer, as part of the transfer of the Business, the unrestricted cash
available to the Company as set out in the Companys balance sheet immediately
prior to Completion to the extent such cash would otherwise be freely
distributable pursuant to the Second Step Distribution by the Company (the "
_Company Net Cash Amount_ "); and

(b) In view of the intragroup (except for the participation of the Minority
Shareholders) nature of the transfer of the Business to the Buyer and in order
to avoid a futile "cash round" payment at Completion from a bank account of
the Buyer to (ultimately) the same bank account following the Liquidation,
the remainder of the value of the Business will remain outstanding by Buyer to
the Company at Completion, and will on that same day be satisfied by setoff (
_verrekening_ ) against the Liquidation entitlement of the Buyer in the same
amount, due by the Company to Buyer at Completion.

Section 3.2 _Payment of Cash Purchase Amount_.

 

(a) Buyer shall pay, at Completion, the Cash Purchase Amount minus that
portion of the Company Net Cash Amount that is set off against the Cash
Purchase Amount (the " _Net Cash Deduction_ ") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account of the Settlement Agent designated in
writing by the Company to Buyer at least four (4) Business Days prior
to Completion (the " _Settlement Agent Account_ "), for distribution to the
Minority Shareholders on behalf of the Company as set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) The Company shall pay, at Completion, the amount of the Net Cash Deduction
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Settlement Agent
Account, for distribution to the Minority Shareholders as set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 3.3 That portion of the Company Net Cash Amount that is not set off
against the Cash Purchase Amount and thus not transferred to the Settlement
Agent Account at Completion as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ (such
portion of the Company Net Cash Amount being referred to herein as the "
_Company Excess Cash at Completion_ " and the Company Excess Cash at
Completion together with any cash held by the Company after Completion, being
referred to herein as the " _Company Excess Cash_ ") shall be transferred to
Buyer as part of the transfer of the Business pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 3.4 The Company shall inform Buyer of the amount of the Cash Purchase
Amount and the amount of the Net Cash Deduction no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the anticipated day of Completion.

 



3 Section 3.5 Buyer shall procure that the Cash Purchase Amount shall be
sufficient to pay to the Minority Shareholders, by way of the Second Step
Distribution, an amount equal to the Offer Consideration for each issued and
outstanding Share held by the Minority Shareholders at Completion, without
interest and after deduction of dividend withholding or other Tax if and to
the extent so required by applicable Law (which Tax shall be paid out of the
Cash Purchase Amount, without increasing the Cash Purchase Amount, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 18.2_.)

 

Section 3.6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
(including any third-party paying agent) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment of the Cash Purchase Amount otherwise payable under
this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to
this Agreement, such amounts as Buyer shall determine that it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under
applicable Law, taking into account any available reductions or eliminations
of withholding that may have been validly claimed under applicable Law. To the
extent that such amounts are so withheld and timely paid to the appropriate
Tax Authority by Buyer or its agent, as the case may be, they shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement

shall not have any liability to Buyer arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such consent that may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of any circumstances
resulting therefrom.

thereof Buyer may be prevented by the relevant third party from receiving the
Asset intended to be transferred hereunder, or if any attempted transfer,
assignment or sublease would adversely affect the rights of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact
receive all such rights or the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
would forfeit or otherwise lose the benefit of rights that the Company or any
of the 

 



6  Company Subsidiaries is entitled to retain, the Company and Buyer shall

subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies
received by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any such Assets
with respect to the period after Completion, and Buyer shall indemnify and

9 (b) it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to procure the convening

per Share equal to the Offer Consideration payable in cash to the Minority

related to the Liquidation, (iii) pay or discharge all outstanding debts,
liabilities and claims that are assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, (iv)

to the Liquidator regarding ( _inter_ _alia_ ) Buyers financial position and

Company and the Liquidator with any other reasonable requests and
requirements. In addition, Buyer shall from time to time provide reasonably
required comfort to the Liquidator on Buyers financial position.

set out in this  _Article_ __ _ 18_ and shall co-sign this Agreement in

whatsoever from the Minority Shareholders.

or, if applicable, the Liquidator, or one or more of the Independent
Directors, may ask Buyer for one or more reasonable advance payments for such
Liquidation Costs and Liabilities, which Buyer shall provide following such
request. The Company Board or, if applicable, the Liquidator, shall account
for the Liquidation Costs and Liabilities applicable to them. The provisions
of this _Article_ __ _ 19_ constitute an irrevocable third party stipulation

the Liquidator, the Indemnified Parties and the Independent Directors.

the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by Electronic Delivery, will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will

original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the
use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a

remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any material way. Upon such
a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

is to be effective (including, in the case of a waiver or extension by the
Company, the Independent Directors if they are still serving on the Company
Board). No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any
right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or

this Agreement, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

Section 23.12 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_. The Parties agree
