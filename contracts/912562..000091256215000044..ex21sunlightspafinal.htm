PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK

Transaction Expenses (which such amounts and payees the Seller shall deliver
to the Buyer prior to the Closing); (ii) to the holders of any Indebtedness
identified in Schedule 2.3(b), the amount required to pay in full and
discharge all such Indebtedness as determined from the Payoff Statements (such
aggregate amount being hereinafter the "Closing Date Debt"); (iii) to the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Amount; and (iv) to the Seller an amount equal to the
Purchase Price, less the amount of the Transaction Expenses, the Closing Date
Debt and the Escrow Amount.



(b) No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall have delivered to the Buyer, a written statement from each Person
identified in Schedule 2.3(b) (which Schedule, Seller represents and warrants,
will contain a true, correct and complete list of each Person to whom any
Target Group Member has, as of the date hereof, any outstanding Indebtedness)
(each such written statement being hereinafter a "Payoff Statement"), which
Payoff Statements shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and, as to each Person identified in Schedule 2.3(b): (i) shall set
forth the full amount (or a methodology for calculating the full amount) which
is to be paid to such Person on the Closing Date in order to pay in full and
discharge all Indebtedness which any Target Group Member has to any such
Person, including interest, fees, prepayment fees or penalties and amounts, if
any, due in connection with the termination of any foreign currency or
interest rate protection agreements; and (ii) shall provide that upon payment
on the Closing Date to the Person which has issued the Payoff Statement of the
amount stated or described in the Payoff Statement, all Liens of such Person
on all tangible and intangible assets of any Target Group Member shall be
released and discharged simultaneously with the Closing.



(c) Payments to be made by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(a) shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one (1) or more accounts,
which account or accounts shall, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties:
(i) in the case of the Transaction Expenses and the amounts to be paid to
Seller, be designated by the Seller in writing to the Buyer not less than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date; (ii) in the case of the Person's
identified in







Schedule 2.3(b), be identified in the applicable Payoff Statement of each such

Payoff Statements to the Persons identified therein, the Seller shall be and
continue to be liable, on and after the Closing Date, for payment of (i) all
Transaction Expenses and (ii) all Indebtedness of all members of the Target
Group existing as of the Closing Date.



2.4 Closing Deliveries. At the Closing, subject to and on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement,



(a) the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller each of the following documents:



(i)the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by the Buyer;



(ii)any other Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Buyer and its Affiliates
who are a party thereto; and



(iii)a good standing certificate with respect to the Buyer certified by the
Secretary of State of the State of Buyer's incorporation as of a date not more
than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date.



(b) the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer each of the following documents:



(i) stock certificates representing the Stock, duly endorsed in blank form for
transfer or accompanied by appropriate stock powers duly executed in blank
together with the minute books of the Companies;



(ii) stock certificates and minute books for each Target Group Member other
than the Companies;



(iii) consents to assignment of Material Contracts and Permits identified in
Schedule 2.4(b)(iii);



(iv)the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by the Seller;



(v)any other Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Seller and his Affiliates
who are a party thereto;



(vi)the resignation effective as of the Closing from each director and officer
of each Target Group Member in writing;



(vii)a good standing certificate with respect to each of the Companies
certified by the Secretary of State of its state of incorporation, as of a
date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date; and











(viii) an affidavit of non-foreign status of the Seller, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, that complies with Section 1445 of the
Code.



2.5 Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment. The Seller shall have delivered to
the Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement, an estimated consolidated
balance sheet of the Target Group as of the Effective Time (the "Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet") and an estimated calculation of Net Non-Cash Working
Capital as of the Effective Time, based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
(the "Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital"). Seller represents and warrants
to Buyer that the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Non-
Cash Working Capital will each be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Company Financial Statements and
the past practices of the Target Group (for the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent GAAP provides for a range of alternatives, such past practices shall
govern), except for the impact of the recognition of revenue on certain
Contracts in progress, as agreed upon prior to Closing by Seller and Buyer, in
the calculation of amounts reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
and in the calculation of the Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital. The
Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital will also be prepared in accordance
with the definition of Net Non-Cash Working Capital. If the Estimated Net Non-
Cash Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Target, then the
difference shall constitute the "Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital
Deficit". If the Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital is greater than the
Working Capital Target, then the difference shall constitute the "Estimated
Net Non-Cash Working Capital Surplus".



2.6 Adjustments to Purchase Price



(a) Closing Balance Sheet. As promptly as practicable following the Closing

Date, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall, acting in good faith and using all reasonable efforts, prepare
and deliver to the Seller a consolidated balance sheet of the Target Group as
of the Effective Time (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a calculation of Net
Non-Cash Working Capital as of the Effective Time based on the Closing Balance
Sheet (the "Net Non-Cash Working Capital Calculation"). The Closing Balance
Sheet and the Net Non-Cash Working Capital Calculation (collectively, the
"Draft Closing Statements") shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a
basis consistent with the preparation of the Company Financial Statements and
the past practices of the Target Group (for the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent GAAP provides for a range of alternatives, such past practices shall
govern), except for the impact of the recognition of revenue on certain
Contracts in progress, as agreed upon prior to Closing by Seller and Buyer, in
the calculation of amounts reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet and in the
calculation of the Net Non-Cash Working Capital. The Net Non-Cash Working
Capital Calculation will also be prepared in accordance with the definition of
Net Non-Cash Working Capital.



(i) During the period from the date the Draft Closing Statements are delivered
by the Buyer to the Seller through the date such statements are finally
determined, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer's and the Companies'
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Seller and his
Representatives and to provide the Seller and his Representatives full access
to the work papers of the Buyer and the Companies and their respective
Representatives in connection with







the review of the Draft Closing Statements, and the Buyer shall make
reasonably

available to the Seller and its Representatives, individuals responsible for
the preparation of the Draft Closing Statements in order to respond to
inquiries of the Seller related thereto.



(ii) If the Seller disputes the correctness of the Draft Closing Statements
provided to the Seller by the Buyer, the Seller shall notify the Buyer in
writing of its objections within thirty (30) Business Days after its receipt
of the Draft Closing Statements and shall describe the reasons for the
Seller's objections (specifying in reasonable detail such disagreement). If
the Seller fails to deliver a written notice of objection to the Buyer within
such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Seller shall be deemed to have
accepted the Draft Closing Statements provided by the Buyer to the Seller,
which shall be final and binding on the Buyer and the Seller and used for the
purposes of this Section 2.6. If, however, the Seller delivers a written
notice of objection (the "Dispute Notice") to the Buyer within such thirty
(30) Business Day period, the Seller and the Buyer shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve any disputed items within thirty (30) Business Days after the
date of the Buyer's receipt of the Dispute Notice.



(iii) If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve any items in dispute
relating to the Draft Closing Statements within thirty (30) Business Days
after the date of the Buyer's receipt of the Dispute Notice (or such other
period as the Parties may agree), the Seller and the Buyer shall submit the
dispute to an accounting firm which shall be selected by mutual agreement of
Buyer and Seller and which: (A) has at least a regional reputation; and (B)
has had no prior relationship with Buyer, Seller or the Target Group (the
"Independent Accountant") to resolve all items remaining in dispute, and such
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties. The Independent Accountant, in undertaking the
tasks to be performed by it as provided herein, shall act as an expert and not
as an arbitrator. The Buyer and the Seller may present to the Independent
Accountant their respective positions regarding the dispute (provided that,
for greater certainty, such presentations are limited to matters described in
the Dispute Notice), and each of the Buyer and the Seller shall have the right
to present additional documents, materials and other information, and make an
oral presentation to the Independent Accountant, regarding such dispute and
the Independent Accountant shall consider such additional documents, materials
and other information and such oral presentation. Any such other documents,
materials or other information shall be copied to each of the Buyer and the
Seller and each of the Seller and the Buyer shall be entitled to attend any
such oral presentation.



(iv) The Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely on such
presentations from the Seller and the Buyer and not by independent review,
only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and
shall deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a balance sheet of the Target Group
as of the Closing Date reflecting its resolution of all issues in dispute and
the Net Non-Cash Working Capital Calculation shown thereon. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accountant: (i) shall be bound to the principles of this Section 2.6
(including Section 2.6(a)(i)), (ii) shall limit its review to matters
specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice, and (iii) shall not assign a
value to any item higher than the highest value for such item claimed by
either Party or lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either
Party. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Independent Accountant to complete its work and render its determination in
writing within thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement.



(v) The Net Non-Cash Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.6 (whether by failure of the Seller to deliver a Dispute Notice to
the Buyer, by the agreement of the Parties or by the final determination of
the Independent Accountant) shall be deemed to be, and shall be referred to
herein, as the "Final Net Non-Cash Working Capital".



(vi) The Companies, prior to Closing, shall be responsible for the costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and Estimated Net Non-Cash Working Capital Calculation. The
Seller and the Buyer shall each bear, and be responsible for, the costs and
expenses incurred by each of them (including any fees and expenses of their
respective accounting firms) in connection with negotiation of disputed items
in the Closing Balance Sheet and Net Non-Cash Working Capital Calculation. If
the Independent Accountant is engaged, the fees, expenses and disbursements of
the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between (and paid by) the Seller

shall be increased on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar that the
Closing Date Cash exceeds $0, and the Buyer shall pay, pursuant to Section
2.6(d) below, to the Seller in immediately available











funds an amount equal to such difference. If Seller disputes the correctness

(e) Adjustment for Chinese Capital Gains Taxes. For purposes of this

COVENANTS

6.1 Tax Matters.



(a) Tax Returns.



(i)Except as set forth in Section 6.1(a)(ii), the Buyer shall control and be
responsible for the filing of all Tax Returns filed with respect to the Target
Group after the Closing Date. The Buyer shall prepare any Straddle Period Tax
Returns of the Target Group in accordance with past practice (including, for
this purpose, any past practice of the Seller) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law; provided, however, that the Buyer shall provide the Seller
with a copy of any such Tax Returns for his review and comment at least thirty
(30) Business Days prior to its filing and the Buyer shall make any changes
reasonably requested by the Seller; provided, further, that a comment by the
Seller shall not be considered reasonable for this purpose to the extent that
it is inconsistent with past practice (including, for this purpose, any past
practice of the Seller).



(ii)The Seller, at Seller's expense, shall control and be responsible for the
preparation and timely filing of all income Tax Returns of the Target Group
filed on or after the Closing Date that relate to a Pre-Closing Period. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practice unless
otherwise required by Law, except to the extent past practice is inconsistent
with the method in which items on the Closing Balance Sheet have been
calculated, in which case the methods used in preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet shall control; provided, however, that the Seller shall provide the
Buyer with a copy of any such Tax Returns for its review and comment at least
thirty (30) Business Days prior to its filing and the Seller shall make any
changes reasonably requested by the Buyer; provided, further, that a comment
by the Buyer shall not be considered reasonable for this purpose to the extent
that it is inconsistent with past practice (including, for this purpose, any
past practice of the Seller).



(iii)The Seller shall pay all Taxes shown to be due on any Pre-Closing Period
Tax Returns and on the Straddle Period Tax Returns (to the extent such Taxes
are allocable to the Pre-Closing Period under Section 6.1(e) and (h)). The
Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes shown to be due on the
Straddle Period Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are allocable to the
Post-Closing Period under Section 6.1(e).



(iv)Except as required by Law, the Buyer shall not amend or extend the statute
of limitations with respect to any Tax Returns of the Target Group relating to
a Pre-Closing Period, without the prior written consent of the Seller.



(v)If Buyer disagrees, in good faith, with the treatment of any item on any
Tax Return for a tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that was





prepared by or at the direction of the Seller pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(ii),
or if Buyer disagrees with Seller's Gross-Up Calculation, Buyer shall notify
the Seller of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt
of the Tax Return or Seller's Gross-Up Calculation. Upon delivery of any such
notice, Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult each other in an effort to
resolve such dispute in good faith. If any such point of disagreement cannot
be resolved within thirty (30) days after the date of Buyer's objection
notice, Buyer and Seller shall submit such disagreement to the Independent
Accountant and shall follow the dispute resolution process described in
Section 2.6(a).



(vi)The Total Tax Gross-Up Amount shall be paid to the Seller in immediately
available funds within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the
Total Tax Gross-Up Amount has been finally determined hereunder. Payment will
be made to one (1) or more accounts, which accounts shall be designated by the
Seller in writing to the Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the date payment is to be made (or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties).



(b) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall: (i)
provide assistance to the other Party as reasonably requested in preparing and
filing Tax Returns; (ii) make available to the other Party as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes concerning
the Target Group; and (iii) retain any books and records that could reasonably
be expected to be necessary or useful in connection with the preparation by
the other Party of any Tax Return. Each of the Buyer and the Seller shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include, upon any
Party's reasonable request, providing records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any Tax Contest, making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information, and explaining
any materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.1(b). The Parties agree that
payments made to employees of the Target Group Members on or about the Closing
Date, with respect to the Target Group Members' 2015 profit sharing plan,
including the employer portion of any applicable payroll Taxes arising in
connection with such payments, shall be treated as pre-Closing expenses of the
Target Group Members, for all purposes.



(c) Transfer Taxes. Any transfer, sales, use value added, excise, stock
transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes ("Transfer
Taxes") that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement shall be borne one half (1/2) by the Buyer and one half
(1/2) by the Seller. The Parties shall cooperate in filing such forms and
documents as may be necessary in connection with the payment of any such
Transfer Tax, and to obtain any exemption or refund of any such Transfer Tax.



(d) Tax Contests. If any Party receives notice of any Tax Contest with respect
to Taxes of any Target Group Member, such Party will notify, within thirty
(30) days, the other Party in writing of such Tax Contest, but the failure to
so notify will not relieve the other Party of any liability it may have,
except to the extent the Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby.







(i) With respect to any Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return, the Seller may assume and control all proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Contest; provided, that to the extent that such Tax Contest
relates to an issue that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Taxes of the Target Group, or the Buyer (or any direct or indirect owner
thereof) in a Post-Closing Period, the Seller and the Buyer will jointly
control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Contest. No
Party will settle or compromise any such Tax Contest without the other
Parties' written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(ii) With respect to all other Tax Contests, the Buyer shall assume and
control all proceedings; provided that, to the extent that such Tax Contest
relates to an issue that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Taxes of the Seller in a Pre-Closing Period, the Seller and the Buyer will
jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Contest.



(e) Allocation of Taxes. In the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle Period,
the allocation of such Taxes to the Pre-Closing Period shall:



(i) in the case of any property Taxes or similar Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period; and

(ii) in the case of any Taxes (other than property or similar Taxes), be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable
period ended as of the end of the Closing Date.



(f) Allocation of Purchase Price. Within 120 days of the determination of the
Final Net Non-Cash Working Capital and Closing Date Cash, the Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price.
If the Seller fails to deliver a written notice of objection to the Buyer
within the twenty (20) Business Day period following delivery of the proposed
Purchase Price allocation, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Purchase Price allocation proposed by the Buyer to the Seller, which shall be
final and binding on the Buyer and the Seller for purposes of their Tax
Returns. If, however, the Seller delivers a written notice of objection to the
Buyer within such twenty (20) Business Day period, the Seller and the Buyer
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed items within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date of the Buyer's receipt of the Seller's written
notice of objection. If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve the
disputed items, the Seller and the Buyer shall submit the dispute to the
Independent Accountant to resolve all items remaining in dispute and the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between the
Buyer and the Seller in the manner provided for by Section 2.6(a)(vii). The
Buyer and the Seller shall provide to the Independent Accountant, on a timely
basis, all back-up materials relating to the unresolved disputes requested by
the Independent Accountant to the extent available to the Buyer or its
representatives or the Seller and his representatives. The Independent
Accountant, in undertaking the tasks to be performed by it as provided herein,
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The Buyer and the Seller may
present



to the Independent Accountant any material related to the unresolved disputes
(provided that copies of such material shall be provided to the other party)
and discuss the issues in question with the Independent Accountant (provided
that both parties participate in such discussions, so that no "ex-parte"
communications take place with the Independent Accountant). In conjunction
with resolving any items in dispute between the Buyer and the Seller, within
thirty (30) days of engagement of the Independent Accountant, the Independent
Accountant shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a Purchase
Price allocation reflecting its resolution of all issues in dispute. The
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties. The Parties shall use the final Purchase Price
allocation to prepare and file IRS Form 8883 "Asset Allocation Statement Under
Section 338" and any other state, local or foreign tax returns, if such an
election is made under Section 6.7(h). No Party shall take any inconsistent
position with the final Purchase Price allocation. The Parties shall cooperate
in preparing, executing and filing with the IRS and any other state, local or
foreign tax authorities all necessary information returns required under
Section 338 of the Code and the Regulations promulgated thereunder.



(g) Within thirty (30) days of the determination of the Allocation of Purchase
Price, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a calculation of the Total
Tax Gross-Up Amount (the "Seller's Gross-Up Calculation").



(h) Section 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer shall have the right, exercisable by
delivery of written notice to the Seller at any time within thirty (30) days
of the Buyer's receipt of the Seller's Gross-Up Calculation, to make an
election under Code Section 338(h)(10) or Code Section 338(g) with respect to
the Transaction. In the event that the Buyer makes an election under Code
Section 338(h)(10) or Code Section 338(g) with respect to the Transaction,
Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer in the preparation of and Seller shall
make a timely election (the "Election" or "Elections" as applicable) referred
to in Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or Code Section 338(g), as applicable,
and under any comparable provision of state or local law, with respect to the
purchase contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
promptly executing and filing any forms or other documentation necessary to
effect or otherwise in connection with the Election. Seller shall include any
income, gain, loss, deduction, or other tax item resulting from the Election
on his Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Seller shall also
pay any Tax imposed on any Target Group Member attributable to the making of
the Election, including (i) any Tax imposed under Section 1374 of the Code,
(ii) any tax imposed under Code Section 338 and the Regulations thereunder, or
(iii) any state, local or foreign Tax imposed on the Target Group's gains,
and, in addition to any other indemnification obligations, Seller shall
indemnify Buyer and the Companies against any adverse consequences arising out
of any failure to pay any such Taxes.



(i) Chinese Capital Gains Taxes. As soon as practicable following the Closing,
the Buyer intends to cause Rough Brothers Asia, LLC to transfer all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Rough Brothers Greenhouse
Manufacturing (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to an affiliated foreign holding
corporation and to cause RBI International, LLC to transfer all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of RBI Solar (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. to an affiliated
foreign holding corporation. These transfers will result in the imposition of
a liability for payment by Rough Brothers Asia, LLC of Chinese capital gains
Taxes relating to the transfer of all the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Rough Brothers Greenhouse Manufacturing (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and creation
of a liability for payment by RBI International, LLC of Chinese capital gains
Taxes relating to the transfer of all the issued and outstanding capital stock
of RBI Solar (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Promptly





following the transfer by Rough Brothers Asia, LLC of all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Rough Brothers Greenhouse Manufacturing
(Shanghai) Co., Ltd., (or, in the event that payment of such capital gains
Taxes is required to effect such transfer) Buyer shall provide Seller written
notice of the amount of the Chinese capital gains taxes due in connection with
such transfer. In addition, promptly following the transfer by RBI
International, LLC of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of RBI
Solar (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., (or, in the event that payment of such capital
gains Taxes is required to effect such transfer) Buyer shall provide Seller
written notice of the amount of the Chinese capital gains taxes due in
connection with such transfer. In connection with the determination by the
Buyer of the amount of the capital gains Taxes due in connection with the
transfers described above in this Section 6.1(i), the Buyer shall not have any
obligation to challenge any assessment of capital gains Taxes imposed on any
such transfers by the Chinese Governmental Authorities. Seller shall have a
period of fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt by Seller of the
written notices referred to in the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1(i)
to pay the amount of the capital gains Taxes due in connection with the
applicable transfer, as identified in the written notice provided by Buyer, to
Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified
in writing by Buyer or to provide a written notice to Buyer objecting to the
Buyer's calculation of the amount of the capital gains Taxes due in connection
with any such transfer. In the event that the Seller objects to the Buyer's
calculation of the amount of the capital gains taxes due in connection with
any such transfers, during the fifteen (15) day period following the date that
the Seller's written objection to the Buyer's calculations is received by the
Buyer, the Seller and the Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to resolve their
dispute as to the amount of the capital gains Taxes which are due in
connection with the transfers described in this Section 6.1(i). In the event
that the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve their dispute with respect
to the amount of the capital gains Taxes within such fifteen (15) day period,
the dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution,
and the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated
between Buyer and Seller in the same manner as provided for in Section
2.6(a)(vi). Seller's obligations to Buyer under this Section 6.1(i), exclusive
of any costs incurred in connection with the resolution of any dispute by the
Independent Accountant, shall not exceed $200,000.

Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to apply notwithstanding the
execution or announcement of this Agreement by the Parties, and agrees to
fulfill its obligations thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof.

manner, either directly, indirectly, individually, in partnership, jointly or
in conjunction with any Person, (i) engage in the business of providing,
distributing or selling within the Territory products or services functionally
equivalent to the Target Group's products or services, or (ii) have an equity
or profit interest in (other than the ownership of less than one percent (1%)
of the shares of an entity, the shares or ownership interests of which are
publicly traded on a national exchange), advise or render services (of an
executive, marketing, manufacturing, research and development, administrative,

Group to terminate or modify such customer's or supplier's relationship with
the Target Group.



(c) Severability. In the event a judicial or arbitral determination is made
that any provision of this Section 6.3 constitutes an unreasonable or
otherwise unenforceable restriction against the Seller, the provisions of this
Section 6.3 shall be rendered void only to the extent that such judicial or
arbitral determination finds such provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable. In this regard, any judicial authority construing this
Agreement shall be empowered to sever any portion of the Territory, any
prohibited business activity or any time period from the coverage of this
Section 6.3 and to apply the provisions of this Section 6.3 to the remaining
portion of the Territory, the remaining business activities and the remaining
time period not so severed by such judicial or arbitral authority. Moreover,
notwithstanding the fact that any provision of this Section 6.3 is determined
not to be specifically enforceable, the Buyer shall nevertheless be entitled
to recover monetary damages as a result of the breach of such provision by the
Seller, or any of them. The time period during which the prohibitions set
forth in this Section 6.3 shall apply shall be tolled and suspended for a
period equal to the aggregate time during which the Seller violates such
prohibitions in any respect.



(d) Injunctive Relief. Any remedy at law for any breach of the provisions
contained in this Section 6.3 shall be inadequate and the Buyer shall be
entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy the Buyer might
have hereunder. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.11, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Seller of any of the covenants
contained in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b), Buyer shall have the right to
commence proceedings against the Seller in any court of competent jurisdiction
to seek the injunctive relief provided for by this Section 6.3(d).

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the applicable
Target Group Members (or any successor(s)) to, until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date (or, in the case of clause (ii), for so long
thereafter as any claim for indemnification asserted on or prior to such date
has not been finally adjudicated) (i) keep and not amend, modify or repeal any
provision of the current indemnity agreements in place for the current
directors and officers of the Target Group, (ii) indemnify (except as provided
in the immediately following proviso) the current and



former directors and officers of the Target Group to the fullest extent to
which the Target Group is permitted to indemnify such officers and directors
with respect to any claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
prior to the Closing (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or under the Ancillary Agreements); provided
that, the foregoing obligation of the applicable Target Group Member to
indemnify current or former officers or directors of the Target Group members
shall not apply to claims for indemnification made by any current or former
officers or directors of any Target Group Member which are attributable to
claims made by the Buyer for indemnification which under the provisions of
Section 7.2(a)(vi); and (iii) except to the extent required by Law, not take
any action so as to amend, modify or repeal the provisions for indemnification
of directors, officers or employees contained in the organizational documents
of the Target Group in such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of
any individual who shall have served as a director or officer of the Target
Group prior to the Closing to be indemnified by the Target Group in respect of
their serving in such capacities at or prior to the Closing.



(b) The provisions of this Section 6.4 shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
individual referred to in this Section 6.4, his or her heirs and successors
and his or her legal representatives.



(c) If any of the Buyer or the Target Group Members or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) amalgamate, consolidate with or merge or wind
up into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity,
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its prospective assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Buyer and the Target Group Member(s) shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

supplemented by excess insurance coverage through Copper Mountain Assurance,
Inc., provides certain occurrence based insurance coverages to the Target
Group Members pursuant to the insurance policies identified on Exhibit 6.5
(the "Captive Insurance Policies"). Prior to the Closing, Seller has taken the
necessary actions to terminate the Captive Insurance Policies effective on or
prior to the Closing. In connection with such termination, certain of the
Target Group Members shall be entitled to a refund of a yet to be determined
portion of the premiums paid for the Captive Insurance Policies (the "Premium
Refunds"). The Premium Refunds will be received by the Target Group Members
after the Closing. Buyer hereby agrees to cause the Target Group Members to
remit to the Seller any and all Premium Refunds received by any of the Target
Group Members subsequent to the Closing. Any income to be recognized as the

7.4 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims.



(a) In the event that, subsequent to the Closing, an Indemnified Party
receives notice of the assertion of a Third Party Claim against such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof,
together with a statement of any available information regarding such claim to
the Indemnifying Party within five (5) Business Days after learning of such
claim (or within such shorter time as may be necessary to give the
Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to respond to and defend such
claim). Such written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the
potential Losses, in each case to the extent known. The failure of the
Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Indemnifying Party's
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party can demonstrate that such failure has materially and irreparably
prejudiced the defense of any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within ten
(10) days after receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, to
conduct at its expense the defense against such claim in its own name, or if
required in the name of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume control, the Indemnified Party shall retain control of
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof. The
Party not controlling such Third Party Claim shall cooperate with and make
available to the controlling Party such assistance and materials as may be
reasonably requested by it (including copies of any summons, complaint or
other pleading which may have been served on such Party and any written claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same),
and shall have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted
by counsel of its own choosing. The Party controlling such Third Party Claim
shall keep the non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party
Claim and fees incurred with respect thereto, on at least a monthly basis, and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the non-controlling Party
with respect thereto.







(b) If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance herewith: (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co‑counsel
at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation,
defense and settlement thereof; (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any
papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party unless the judgment or settlement provides (a) solely for
the payment of money by the Indemnifying Party that will be paid or reimbursed
concurrent with the execution and delivery of such judgment, settlement or
compromise, (b) that the Indemnified Party receives an unconditional release
from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim and (c) no
obligation of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates to perform
obligations or admit liability. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does
not agree in writing to accept the defense of a Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with the Third Party Claim in such manner as the Indemnified
party deems appropriate, in its sole discretion and the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification therefor to the extent provided for by
this Article VII.



(c) If: (i) a Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with an
Action, the object of which is to obtain an injunction, restraining order,
declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief (including criminal penalties)
against the Indemnified Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes
that, in light of actual or potential conflict of interest, it would be
inappropriate for legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party to
represent the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably
concludes that an adverse determination of the Third Party Claim would
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect, then (iv) the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to retain its own counsel and control the defense or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim and its reasonable legal fees and
costs and expenses of defending such Third Party Claim shall be included as
Losses to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified; provided
that, under the circumstances described in this Section 7.4(c), the
Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7.5 Claims for Indemnification.



(a) An Indemnified Party shall make any claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 by delivering a notice setting forth such claim in
reasonable detail (a "Claim Notice").



(b) The Indemnifying Party may make a written objection ("Objection") to any
claim for indemnification. The Objection shall be delivered to the Indemnified
Party within ten (10) days after delivery of a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party.



(c) For a period of ten (10) Business Days, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any claim for
indemnification to which an





Objection is made. If such Parties are able to resolve any such claim for
indemnification, they shall prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such
agreement.



7.6 Treatment of Indemnification Claims. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by all Parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by applicable Law.



7.7 Calculation of Losses.



(a) The amount of any Losses payable under this ARTICLE VII by the
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i) amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) the Tax Benefits actually
recognized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Losses in the taxable year of such Loss or the succeeding taxable
year. For the avoidance of doubt, Tax Benefits actually recognized does not
include any increase in any net operating loss of any Indemnified Party or any
increase in the tax basis of any asset held by, or other Tax attribute of, any
Indemnified Party until such Tax attribute actually results in a refund,
credit for overpayment or reduction in Tax payments. If the Indemnified Party
receives a Tax Benefit or any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to
an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified
Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment in the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net
of any expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting
such amount (including any deductible amounts, attorney's fees and any
increased insurance premiums). If the Indemnified Party receives any payment
from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses and the Indemnified Party
could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party based on
the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against such third party as
are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such third
party the amount of such indemnification payment.



(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this ARTICLE VII for
Losses that are for special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or
multiples of earnings except to the extent that the Indemnified Party is
obligated to pay any third party any amounts for special, consequential,
exemplary or punitive damages or multiples of earnings as a result of a Third
Party Claim.



(c) No claim shall be made for any Losses which are accounted for in
calculating the Final Net Non-Cash Working Capital.



7.8 Exclusion of Other Remedies. From and after the Closing, the rights of the
Buyer, the Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified
Parties to indemnification relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to those contained in this
ARTICLE VII, and such indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedies of the Buyer, the Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
the Seller Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to
any matter in any way relating to this





Agreement or arising in connection herewith. To the maximum extent permitted
by Law, the Buyer, the Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties hereby waive all other monetary rights and remedies with
respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in
connection herewith, whether under any Laws, at common law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the existence of this ARTICLE
VII and of the rights and restrictions set forth herein do not limit any
remedy against the Parties hereto to claims based on fraud. For purposes of
determining the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a claim
for indemnification under this Agreement, each representation and warranty of
the Seller contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard and
without giving effect to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard
or similar qualification contained in such representation or warranty (i.e.,
as if such standard or qualification were deleted from such representation or
warranty).



7.9 Escrow. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, on behalf of the Seller, pay
to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount to be held pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. Except for payment required to be made by Seller of the
amount, if any, of any post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by Section 2.6(b) hereof and any amount that the Seller is
required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to
Transaction Expenses (as contemplated by Section 8.2(a)(vii)), which amounts
shall be paid directly by Seller to Buyer, any payment the Seller is obligated
to make to any Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be paid: (i) first, to the extent there are
sufficient funds in the Escrow, by release of funds to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from the Escrow by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Amount and; (ii)
second, to the extent the Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay any remaining
sums due, then the Seller shall be required to pay all such additional sums
due and owing to the Buyer Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately
available funds promptly after the date such claim is finally determined to be
owing.

of which shall be deemed incorporated in this Agreement and made a part
hereof), sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to
the Transaction, supersedes all prior discussions, understandings, agreements
and representations and shall not be modified or affected by any offer,
proposal, statement or representation, oral or written, made by or for any
Party in connection with the negotiation of the terms hereof.



8.9 Third Parties. Except for the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the Parties to
this Agreement, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.





8.10 Disclosure Generally. The schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement form an integral part of this Agreement for all purposes of it. All
references herein to this Agreement shall include the schedules and exhibits
attached to this Agreement. Any exception or qualification set forth in the
schedules with respect to a particular representation, warranty or covenant
contained herein shall be deemed to be an exception or qualification with
respect to all other applicable representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement only to the extent the applicability of such
exception or qualification to any other applicable representation, warranty or
covenant would be reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure to a
Person reviewing the schedules, regardless of whether an explicit reference to
such other representation, warranty or covenant is made; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, information required to be disclosed in
connection with any of the representations and warranties contained
constituting the Fundamental Representations and information required to be
disclosed in connection with any representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.19 shall
not be deemed to be disclosed unless disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule
applicable to such Fundamental Representation or any such Section. Nothing in
the schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement except to the extent of the information
provided in the applicable schedule. Inclusion of any item in a schedule or
exhibit does not constitute a determination by the representing Party that
such item is material and shall not be deemed to establish a standard of
materiality. No disclosure in a schedule or exhibit relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or any potential adverse contingency
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred or that such adverse contingency
will actually occur.



8.11 Arbitration. The Parties agree to submit to resolution by binding
arbitration any unresolved claim, controversy, issue or dispute arising among
or between the Parties out of or with respect to this Agreement or the
Parties' respective rights, duties and obligations hereunder (each, a
"Dispute"), upon written notice by any Party to the other Parties. Such
arbitration shall be conducted as follows:



(a) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with and governed by the
Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"), except as expressly provided otherwise in this section,
and administered by the AAA. The Parties shall provide a copy of this
arbitration clause to the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) shall apply the
appropriate substantive law, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure with
respect to procedural, discovery or evidentiary matters. The arbitration shall
be conducted in the location mutually agreed upon by the Parties; provided
that, if the Parties do not so agree within ten (10) days after written notice
of arbitration is given by a Party, the arbitration shall be conducted in
Cincinnati, Ohio at a location selected by the arbitrator(s).



(b) The arbitrator(s), as applicable, for such arbitration shall be selected
as follows:



(i) In the event of arbitration with an amount in controversy equal to or less
than $1,000,000, arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) neutral arbitrator
mutually agreed upon by the Parties. If no arbitrator is agreed upon within
ten (10) days following commencement of arbitration, or if the arbitrator
selected by the



Parties is unable or unwilling to arbitrate the Dispute, the arbitrator shall
be such neutral arbitrator as is selected by the AAA; or



(ii) In the event of arbitration with an amount in controversy greater than
$1,000,000, arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) neutral
arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days following commencement of arbitration,
each Party shall select one (1) neutral arbitrator in whatever area(s) of
expertise such Party believes is relevant to the dispute. Within ten (10) days
following such appointment, the two (2) neutral arbitrators so selected shall
select the third neutral arbitrator from a list provided by the AAA who shall
be a practicing attorney having experience in the area of commercial
contracts, and who shall act as chair of the arbitration panel. If the
arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third
arbitrator within such ten (10) day period, the third arbitrator shall be
selected by the AAA.



(c) The sole arbitrator or chair of the arbitration panel, as applicable,
shall establish a limited time period for discovery and procedures designed to
reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the Parties an
opportunity, in the discretion of the sole arbitrator or chair of the
arbitration panel, as applicable, to discover relevant information from the
opposing Party about the subject matter of the Dispute. Any dispute regarding
discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the sole
arbitrator or the chair of the arbitration panel, as the case may be, and
shall be governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.



(d) The award by the arbitrator(s) shall be in writing, shall be signed by the
sole arbitrator or a majority of the panel of arbitrators, as the case may be,
and shall include a statement of findings of fact and conclusions regarding
the reasons for the disposition of any Dispute. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) shall have the
authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
could order or grant, including without limitation, specific performance of
any obligation created under any agreement between or among the Parties, the
issuance of an injunction, or the imposition of sanctions for abuse or
frustration of the arbitration process; provided, however, that the
arbitrator(s) shall not have the authority to award punitive damages, except
as may be required by statute or to the extent punitive damages are awarded to
a third party in connection with the claim giving rise to such applicable
dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to determine the
comparative responsibility of the Parties hereto for any loss or damages and
assign liability and award relief based upon such comparison. Arbitration of
such issues, including the determination of the amount of any damages suffered
by any Party, shall be to the exclusion of any court of law and the decision
of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon the Parties and their
respective personal representatives, heirs, devisees, successors and
assignees. Judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered
in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.



(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
Party shall bear its own expenses and its attorney's fees and expenses, and
shall equally share the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees and travel
expenses.







 (f) Statements made by any Party or any Party's representative during the
arbitration shall be deemed confidential and no Party or Party's
representative will attempt to use any such statement as evidence in any court
or other legal proceeding. The Parties also agree and acknowledge that the
arbitrator(s) shall not be subject to subpoena to trial or deposition by any
Party for the purpose of divulging statements made or information disclosed by
any Party or witness in the arbitration proceedings. The Parties further agree
and acknowledge that the arbitrator(s) shall not disclose any matter learned
in the arbitration proceedings unless given permission by all of the Parties
or unless required by law.



(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in
any court located in Hamilton County, Ohio, the Parties agreeing that such
courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising out of or
related to this Agreement, without having to post bond therefor or prove
actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled, without submitting such action to arbitration.



8.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.12.



8.13 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall not issue
or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement
with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction, except that the Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, may issue a joint press
release if mutually agreed; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prohibit any Party from issuing or causing publication of any such press
release or public announcement to the extent that such Party determines such
action to be required by Law, applicable regulation or stock market rule, in
which case the Party making such determination shall, if practicable in the
circumstances, use Reasonable Efforts to allow the other Parties reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance. To
the extent feasible, all press releases or other announcements or notices
regarding the Transaction shall be made jointly by the Parties.



8.14 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules and exhibits hereto) may not be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified, and no provision hereof may be waived, except by an
instrument in writing signed by the Seller, the Companies and the Buyer.







8.15 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Buyer, the Companies and the
Seller hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer and/or the Companies, on the one hand, and the Seller or his
Affiliates, on the other hand, Katz Teller may represent the Seller and/or
such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller and/or
such Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Companies or any of
their Affiliates, and even though Katz Teller may have represented the
Companies or any of their Affiliates in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Companies, or any
of their Affiliates. Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications among
Katz Teller, the Companies, the Seller, and/or any of their respective
Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Seller and may be controlled by the Seller and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, the Companies or any of their Affiliates and a third party (other than
a party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the
Closing, the Companies and their Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Katz Teller
to such third party; provided, however, that neither the Companies nor any of
their Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Seller.
