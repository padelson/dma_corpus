**SALE  AND PURCHASE** ****

 

 

Section  2.01 _Sale  and Purchase_.

 

 

(a) _Sale  and Purchase_.  Subject  to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Partnership  hereby agrees to issue and sell
to each Purchaser, and each Purchaser hereby  agrees, severally and not
jointly, to purchase from the Partnership, the number  of Purchased Units
determined pursuant to paragraph (b) below of this  _Section  2.01_ , 
and  each Purchaser agrees to pay the Partnership the Purchase Price for

this  _Section  2.01_.  The  obligation of each Purchaser under this
Agreement is independent of the  obligation of each other Purchaser, and the
failure or waiver of performance  with respect to any Purchaser does not
excuse performance by any other  Purchaser.

 

 

(b) _Common  Units_.  The  number of Purchased Units to be issued and sold
to each Purchaser shall be  equal  to the quotient determined by dividing
(i) the Allocated Purchase Amount for  such Purchaser by (ii) the Purchase

Rights_.  The  respective obligations of each Purchaser under this Agreement
and the  Registration Rights Agreement are several and not joint with the
obligations  of  any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible
in any way for the  performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser
under this Agreement.  The  failure or waiver of performance under this
Agreement or the Registration Rights  Agreement by any Purchaser, or on its
behalf, does not excuse performance by  any  other Purchaser. Nothing
contained herein or in the Registration Rights  Agreement, and no action
taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be  deemed to constitute the
Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint  venture or any other
kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers  are in any way
acting in concert or as a group for purposes of Section 13(d)  of  the
Exchange Act with respect to such obligations or the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement. Each 
Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, 
including the rights arising out of this Agreement or the Registration
Rights  Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to
be joined  as  an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

 

 

**ARTICLE  III**

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF** **THE  PARTNERSHIP**

 



 

The  Partnership represents and warrants to the Purchasers as follows:

 

 

Section  3.01 Existence  of  Partnership and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(a) The  Partnership: (i) is a limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing  and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware; (ii)
has the  requisite limited partnership power and authority, and has all
governmental  licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to
own, lease,  use  and operate its Properties and carry on its business as
its business is now  being conducted as described in the SEC Documents and
will have, at the Closing,  the requisite limited partnership power and
authority, and all governmental  licenses, authorizations, consents and
approvals, necessary to own, lease,  use  and operate its Properties and
carry on its business as its business will be  conducted following the Drop
Down, except where the failure to obtain such  licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals would not reasonably be  expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect; and (iii) is  qualified to do business
in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the  business conducted by it
makes such qualifications necessary, except where  failure so to qualify
would not reasonably be expected to have a Partnership  Material Adverse
Effect. The Partnership is not in  material violation of its certificate of
limited partnership or the Partnership  Agreement.

 

 

(b) Each  of  the Partnership's Subsidiaries has been duly formed and is
validly existing and  in good standing under the laws of the State or other
jurisdiction of its  organization and has the requisite power and authority,
and has all governmental  licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
necessary, to own, lease,  use  or operate its respective Properties and
carry on its business as now being  conducted and will have, at the Closing,
the requisite power and authority,  and  all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals necessary,  to  own, lease, use or
operate its respective Properties and carry on its business  as its business
will be conducted following the Drop Down, except where the  failure to
obtain such licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals would  not be
reasonably likely to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. Each  of 
the Partnership's Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good 
standing as a foreign limited partnership or limited liability company, as 
applicable, and is authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which 
the  ownership or leasing of its respective Properties or the character of
its  respective operations makes such qualification necessary, except where
the  failure to obtain such qualification, license, authorization or good
standing  would not be reasonably likely to have a Partnership Material
Adverse Effect.  None of such Subsidiaries is  in  material violation of
its certificate or agreement of limited partnership,  certificate of
formation or limited liability company agreement or other  organizational
documents.

such limited partner interests or other equity interests,  (ii)  obligations

other than such Subsidiaries.

 

 

(e) The  offer  and sale of the Purchased Units and the limited partner
interests represented  thereby have been duly authorized by the Partnership

Purchasers against payment  therefor in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be validly issued,  fully paid (to the extent required by
applicable Law and the Partnership  Agreement) and nonassessable (except as
such nonassessability may be affected  by  Sections 17-303, 17-607 and
17-804 of the Delaware LP Act) and will be free  of  any and all Liens and
restrictions on transfer, other than restrictions on  transfer under the
Partnership Agreement and under applicable state and federal  securities Laws
and other than such Liens as are created by the Purchasers.

NYSE, and the  Partnership has not received any notice of delisting.

 

 

(g) Except  (i) as set forth in the Partnership Agreement, (ii) as provided
in the Basic  Documents or (iii) for existing awards under the LTIP, there
are no preemptive  rights or other rights to subscribe for or to purchase,
nor any restriction  upon  the voting or transfer of, any partnership or
membership interests of the  Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, pursuant to any agreement  or instrument to which any of such entities
is a party or by which any one  of  them may be bound. None of the execution
of this Agreement, the offering or  sale  of the Purchased Units or the
registration of the Purchased Units pursuant  to  the Registration Rights
Agreement gives rise to any rights for or relating  to  the registration of
any Common Units or other securities of the Partnership  other than pursuant

such violation, default, breach, termination, cancellation, failure to

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a  Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

Section  3.06 _Authority_.  The  Partnership has all necessary limited
partnership power and authority to  execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under the Basic Documents to which  it is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; the  execution, delivery
and performance by the Partnership of the Basic Documents  to  which it is a

and similar Laws  affecting creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity,  including principles of commercial reasonableness,
fair dealing and good faith.

or (ii) where  the failure to receive such authorization, consent, approval,

insurers as may be necessary to continue its  business.

Company Act of 1940, as amended.

warranties of the Purchasers  contained in this Agreement and in any
Assignment and Assumption Agreement  delivered pursuant to Section 8.04(c),

Partnership's knowledge,  any Person acting on its or their behalf has,
directly or indirectly, made  any  offers or sales of any security of the

circumstances that would adversely affect reliance  by  the Partnership on
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the exemption from  the  registration
requirements imposed under Section 5 of the Securities Act for  the 
transactions contemplated hereby or that would require such registration
under  the Securities Act.

 

 

Section  3.14 _Certain  Fees_.  No fees  or commissions are or will be
payable by the Partnership to brokers, finders  or  investment bankers with
respect to the sale of any of the Purchased Units or  the  consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchasers  shall not be
liable for any such fees or commissions.

agreements described in _Section  8.06_   and the  Basic Documents, there

have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.  The Partnership and its
Subsidiaries possess all certificates, authorizations  and permits issued by
the appropriate regulatory authorities necessary to  conduct their respective
businesses, except where the failure to possess such  certificates,
authorizations or permits would not have, individually or in  the 
aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect, and neither the
Partnership  nor any such Subsidiary has received any notice of proceedings
relating to  the  revocation or modification of any such certificate,
authorization or permit,  except where such potential revocation or
modification would not have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership
Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

**ARTICLE  IV**

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF EACH PURCHASER**

 

 

Each  Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants to the
Partnership  with respect to itself as follows:

 

 

Section  4.01 _Valid  Existence_.  Such  Purchaser (i) is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing  under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and (ii) has  the requisite power, and has all
material governmental licenses, authorizations,  consents and approvals
necessary to own its Properties and carry on its business  as its business is
now being conducted, except where the failure to obtain  such  licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals would not reasonably be  expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.02 _No  Conflicts_.  The  execution, delivery and performance
by such Purchaser of this Agreement and  the  Registration Rights Agreement
and all other agreements and instruments to be  executed and delivered by
such Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto or in  connection herewith or
therewith, compliance by such Purchaser with the terms  and provisions hereof
and thereof, and the purchase of the Purchased Units  by  such Purchaser do
not and will not (a) violate any provision of any Law,  governmental permit,
determination or award having applicability to such  Purchaser or any of its
Properties, (b) conflict with or result in a  violation of any provision of
the organizational documents of such Purchaser,  or  (c) require any consent
(other than standard internal consents), approval  or notice under or result
in a violation or breach of or constitute (with or  without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any  right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under any note, bond,  mortgage, license, loan
or credit agreement or other instrument or agreement  to  which such
Purchaser is a party or by which such Purchaser or any of its  Properties may
be bound, except in the case of clauses (a) and (c), where such  violation,
default, breach, termination, cancellation, failure to receive  consent or
approval, or acceleration with respect to the foregoing provisions  of  this
_Section 4.02_  would  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a  Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  4.03 _Investment_.  The  Purchased Units are being acquired for
such Purchaser's own account, or the  accounts of clients for whom such
Purchaser exercises discretionary investment  authority, not as a nominee or
agent, and with no present intention of  distributing the Purchased Units or
any part thereof, and such Purchaser has  no  present intention of selling
or granting any participation in or otherwise  distributing the same in any
transaction in violation of the securities Laws  of  the United States of
America or any state. If such Purchaser should in the  future decide to
dispose of any of the Purchased Units, such Purchaser  understands and agrees
(a) that it may do so only (i) in compliance  with the Securities Act and
applicable state securities law, as then in effect,  or (ii) in the manner
contemplated by any registration statement pursuant  to which such securities
are being offered, and (b) that stop-transfer  instructions to that effect
will be in effect with respect to such securities. 

 

 

Section  4.04 _Nature  of Purchaser_.  Such  Purchaser represents and
warrants to, and covenants and agrees with, the  Partnership that, (a) it is
an "accredited investor" (within the meaning of  Rule 501(a) under the
Securities Act), (b) by reason of its business  and financial experience it
has such knowledge, sophistication and experience  in  business and
financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits  and  risks
of the prospective investment in the Purchased Units, is able to bear  the 
economic risk of such investment and, at the present time, would be able to 
afford a complete loss of such investment and (c) it is acquiring the 
Purchased Units purchased by it only for its own account and not for the
account  of others, for investment purposes and not on behalf of any other
account or  Person or with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
with, any  distribution thereof. Purchaser is not an entity formed for the
specific purpose  of acquiring the Purchased Units.

 

 

Section  4.05 _Receipt  of Information_.  Such  Purchaser acknowledges
that it (a) has access to the SEC Documents and (b)  has  been provided a
reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers  from
Representatives of the Partnership regarding such matters, including with 
respect to the Drop Down.

 

 

Section  4.06 _Restricted  Securities_.  Such  Purchaser understands that
the Purchased Units it is purchasing are  characterized as "restricted
securities" under the federal securities Laws  inasmuch as they are being
acquired from the Partnership in a transaction not  involving a public
offering and that under such Laws and applicable regulations  such securities
may be resold without registration under the Securities Act  only  in
certain limited circumstances. In this connection, such Purchaser represents 
that it is knowledgeable with respect to Rule 144 of the Commission 
promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

 

Section  4.07 _Certain  Fees_.  No fees  or commissions will be payable by
such Purchaser to brokers, finders, or  investment bankers with respect to
the sale of any of the Purchased Units or  the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  4.08 _Legend_.  It is  understood that the certificates evidencing
the Purchased Units will bear the  following legend:

 

 

**" These  securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended  (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state
or other  jurisdiction. These securities may not be sold, offered for sale,
pledged or  hypothecated except pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the  Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from
registration thereunder, in  each  case in accordance with all applicable
securities laws of the states or other  jurisdictions, and in the case of a
transaction exempt from registration, such  securities may only be
transferred if the transfer agent for such securities  has  received
documentation satisfactory to it that such transaction does not require 
registration under the Securities Act** **. "**

 

 

Section  4.09 _Reliance  on Exemptions_.  Purchaser understands that the
Purchased Units are being offered and sold to  Purchaser in reliance upon
specific exemptions from the registration  requirements of United States
federal and state securities laws and that the  Partnership is relying upon
the truth and accuracy of, and Purchaser's  compliance with, the
representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments  and understandings
of Purchaser set forth herein in order to determine the  availability of such
exemptions and the eligibility of Purchaser to acquire  the  Purchased
Units.

 

 

Section  4.10 Reliance  on Purchaser Statements. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Partnership and others  will rely on the acknowledgments, understandings,
agreements, representations  and warranties contained in this Agreement.

 

 

**ARTICLE  V**

 

**COVENANTS**

 

 

Section  5.01 _Purchaser  Lock-Up_ _s_. 

 

 

(a) Without  the prior written consent of the Partnership, each Purchaser
agrees that from  and after the date of this Agreement until Closing, neither
such Purchaser  nor  any of its Affiliates will offer, sell, pledge or
otherwise transfer or dispose  of any Common Units or enter into any
transaction or device designed to do  the  same.

 

 

(b) Without  the prior written consent of the Partnership, each Purchaser
agrees that from  and after the Closing it will not sell any of its Purchased
Units prior to  the  Lock-Up  Date.

 

 

Section  5.02 _Subsequent  Private Offerings_.  From  the date of this
Agreement and until the Closing Date, the Partnership shall  not  grant,
issue or sell any Common Units or other equity or voting securities  of  the
Partnership or any securities convertible into or exchangeable therefor 
(the " _Partnership  Securities_ "),  or  take any other action that may
result in the issuance of any of the foregoing,  in a private offering at a
price less than $41.00 per unit without the written  consent of the holders
of a majority of the Purchased Units; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no 
such consent shall be required in respect of (i) the issuance of awards
pursuant  to the LTIP, the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of
options to  purchase Common Units granted pursuant to the LTIP or the
issuance of Common  Units upon the vesting of "phantom units" granted
pursuant to the LTIP, (ii) the  issuance of Common Units as purchase price
consideration to DCP Midstream LLC  in  connection with future acquisitions
that are accretive to cash flow per Common  Unit, (iii) the issuance of
Partnership Securities to the General Partner in  order for the General
Partner to maintain its 2% general partner interest in  the  Partnership or
(iv) private offerings pursuant to which Lehman Brothers MLP  Opportunity
Fund L.P. and Banc of America Capital Investors V, L.P. (the " _Potential 
Investors_ ")  are  offered the opportunity to participate in such private
offering on the same  terms as all other participants in such private
offering and in an amount (the  " _Investor  Purchase Amount_ ")  that 
is, in the aggregate, no less than the largest amount that will be invested 
by a  purchaser (that is not also a Purchaser under this Agreement)
participating  in  such private offering. For the purposes of the preceding
sentence, the Investor  Purchase Amount shall be allocated to each of the
Potential Investors on a  pro  rata basis. The pro rata allocation for each
such Potential Investor shall  be  the number of Purchased Units that such
Potential Investor shall have purchased  or is entitled to purchase under
this Agreement divided by the total number  of  Purchased Units that the
Potential Investors, as a whole, have purchased or  are  entitled to
purchase under this Agreement. Each of the Potential Investors  participating
in a particular offering shall have the opportunity to share  pro  rata that
portion of the Investor Purchase Amount allocable to any Potential  Investor
not so participating. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership  shall
not, and shall cause its directors, officers and Affiliates not to, sell, 
offer for sale or solicit offers to buy any security (as defined in the 
Securities Act) that would be integrated with the sale of the Purchased
Units  in  a manner that would require the registration under the Securities
Act of the  sale of the Purchased Units to the Purchasers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5.03 _Taking  of Necessary Action_.  Each of  the Parties hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to  take or cause to
be taken all action and promptly to do or cause to be done  all  things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and regulations  to 
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  Without  limiting the foregoing, the Partnership and each
Purchaser shall use its  commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings
and obtain all consents  of  Governmental Authorities that may be necessary
or, in the reasonable opinion  of  the Purchasers or the Partnership, as the
case may be, advisable for the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Basic  Documents.

 

 

Section  5.04 _Disclosure;  Public Filings_.  The  Partnership may,
without prior written consent or notice, (i) file the Basic  Documents as
exhibits to Exchange Act reports and (ii) disclose such information  with
respect to any Purchaser as required by applicable Law or the rules or 
regulations of the NYSE or other exchange on which securities of the
Partnership  are listed or traded.

 



 

Section  5.05 _Other  Actions_.  The  Partnership shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof,  and  not later than
immediately prior to the Closing, file a supplemental listing  application
with the NYSE to list the Purchased Units.

 

 

Section  5.06 Certain  Special Allocations of Book and Taxable Income.  To
the  extent that the Purchase Price is less than the trading price of the
Common  Units on the New York Stock Exchange as of the Closing Date, the
General Partner  intends to specially allocate items of book and taxable
income to the Purchasers  so that their capital accounts in their Common
Units are consistent, on a  per-unit basis, with the capital accounts of the
other holders of Common Units  (and thus to assure fungibility of all Common
Units). Such special allocation  will occur upon the earlier to occur of any
taxable period of the Partnership  ending upon, or after, (i) a book-up event
or book-down event in accordance  with  Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) or a sale of all or  substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership occurring after the date  of  the issuance of the Purchased
Units or (ii) a transfer by a Purchaser of Common  Units to a Person that is
not an Affiliate of the holder. A Purchaser holding  a  Common Unit shall be
required to provide notice to the General Partner of the  transfer of a
Common Unit to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the Purchaser  no later
than the last Business Day of the calendar year during which such  transfer
occurred, unless by virtue of the application of clause (i) above,  the 
General Partner has determined that the Common Units transferred are
consistent,  on a per-unit basis, with the capital accounts of the other
holders of Common  Units.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5.07 _NYSE  Rule Change_.  In the  event that 20 Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date, the NYSE and  the  SEC have not yet
adopted and approved an amendment to Section 312.03 of the  NYSE  Listed
Company Manual that would exempt limited partnerships from the provisions  of
Subsections 312.03(b), (c) and (d) thereof (the " _NYSE  Amendment_ "), 
the  Partnership and the Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to amend
the terms  of this Agreement so as to cause (A) the Purchased Units to
consist of the  maximum number of Common Units that may be issued pursuant to
this Agreement  without requiring the approval of the unitholders of the
Partnership under  the  rules of the NYSE and (B) the remainder of the
Purchased Units to consist of  an  alternative class of limited partner
interests in the Partnership that do not  constitute "common stock" or
"voting securities" under Section 312.03 of the  NYSE Listed Company Manual
and having customary terms and conditions for  offerings of this nature (the
" _Alternative  Class_ ").

incurred by them  or  asserted against or involve any of them as a result
of, arising out of, or  in  any way related to the breach of any of the
representations, warranties or  covenants of the Partnership contained
herein; _provided_ ,  that  such claim for indemnification relating to a

Purchaser Related Party shall be entitled to recover special, consequential 
(including lost profits) or punitive damages. Notwithstanding anything to

covenants of such Purchaser contained herein;  _provided_ ,  that  such

warranty is made prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty;

Section  7.03 _Indemnification  Procedure_.  Promptly  after any
Partnership Related Party or Purchaser Related Party (hereinafter,  the "
_Indemnified  Party_ ")  has  received notice of any indemnifiable claim
hereunder, or the commencement of  any  action or proceeding by a third
party, which the Indemnified Party believes  in  good faith is an
indemnifiable claim under this Agreement, the Indemnified  Party  shall give
the indemnitor hereunder (the " _Indemnifying  Party_ ")  written notice of
such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding,  but failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the  Indemnifying Party
from any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party  hereunder except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially  prejudiced by such
failure. Such notice shall state the nature and the basis  of  such claim to
the extent then known. The Indemnifying Party shall have the  right  to
defend and settle, at its own expense and by its own counsel who shall be 
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, any such matter as long as 
the  Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in good faith. If
the  Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend or settle, it shall promptly
notify  the  Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the
Indemnified Party shall  cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in all commercially  reasonable respects in the defense thereof and
the settlement thereof. Such  cooperation shall include furnishing the
Indemnifying Party with any books,  records and other information reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party  and  in the Indemnified Party's
possession or control. Such cooperation of the  Indemnified Party shall be at
the cost of the Indemnifying Party. After the  Indemnifying Party has
notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to  undertake to defend or
settle any such asserted liability, and for so long  as  the Indemnifying
Party diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party  shall not be
liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the  Indemnified Party
in connection with any defense or settlement of such asserted  liability;
_provided,  however_ ,  that  the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (i)
at its expense, to participate  in  the defense of such asserted liability
and the negotiations of the settlement  thereof and (ii) if (A) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense  or employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party or (B) if  the  defendants in
any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the  Indemnifying
Party and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded  that there
may be reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that  are
different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party 
or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to 
conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified 
Party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such 
legal  defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action,
with the  expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses
related to such  participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as
incurred.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party  shall not settle any indemnified claim without the
consent of the Indemnified  Party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no
liability or obligation on,  involves no admission of wrongdoing or
malfeasance by, and includes a complete  release from liability of, the
Indemnified Party.

**MISCELLANEOUS** ****

 

 

Section  8.01 _Interpretation_.Article,  Section, Schedule, and Exhibit
references are to this Agreement, unless  otherwise specified. All references
to instruments, documents, contracts, and  agreements are references to such
instruments, documents, contracts, and  agreements as the same may be
amended, supplemented, and otherwise modified  from  time to time, unless
otherwise specified. The word "including" shall mean "including but not
limited to." Whenever the Partnership has an obligation under  the Basic
Documents, the expense of complying with such obligation shall be  an 
expense of the Partnership unless otherwise specified therein. Whenever any 
determination, consent or approval is to be made or given by a Purchaser
under  the Basic Documents, such action shall be in such Purchaser's sole
discretion  unless otherwise specified therein. If any provision in the Basic
Documents  is  held to be illegal, invalid, not binding, or unenforceable,
such provision  shall  be fully severable and the Basic Documents shall be
construed and enforced  as if  such illegal, invalid, not binding or
unenforceable provision had never  comprised a part of the Basic Documents,
and the remaining provisions shall  remain in full force and effect. The
Basic Documents have been reviewed and  negotiated by sophisticated parties
with access to legal counsel and shall  not  be construed against the
drafter.

warranties set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.06, 3.09,  3.10, 3.11, 3.12,

shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement  indefinitely, and
the other representations and warranties set forth in this  Agreement shall
survive for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing  Date
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Partnership  or 
any Purchaser. The covenants made in this Agreement or any other Basic
Document  shall survive the closing of the transactions described herein and
remain  operative and in full force and effect regardless of acceptance of
any of the  Purchased Units and payment therefor and repayment, conversion or
repurchase  thereof. All indemnification obligations of the Partnership and
the Purchasers  pursuant to this Agreement shall remain operative and in full
force and effect  unless such obligations are expressly terminated in a
writing by the Parties,  regardless of any purported general termination of
this Agreement.

 

 

Section  8.03 _No  Waiver; Modifications in Writing_.

 

 

(a) _Delay_.  No  failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising
any right, power, or  remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or  partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy
preclude any other or  further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right,
power, or remedy. The  remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any  remedies that may be available to a Party at Law or in
equity or otherwise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Specific  Waiver; Amendment_.  Except  as otherwise provided herein,
no amendment, waiver, consent, modification or  termination of any provision
of this Agreement or any other Basic Document  shall  be effective unless
signed by each of Parties or each of the original  signatories thereto
affected by such amendment, waiver, consent, modification  or  termination.
Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to any provision  of  any
Basic Document, any waiver of any provision of any Basic Document and any 
consent to any departure by the Partnership from the terms of any provision 
of  any Basic Document shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for  the  specific purpose for which made or given. Except where notice is
specifically  required by this Agreement, no notice to or demand on the
Partnership in any  case shall entitle the Partnership to any other or
further notice or demand  in  similar or other circumstances.

 

 

Section  8.04 _Binding  Effect; Assignment_.

 

 

(a) _Binding  Effect_.  This  Agreement shall be binding upon the
Partnership, each Purchaser and their  respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as expressly provided in  this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not be construed so as to confer any right  or benefit upon any Person
other than the Parties to this Agreement and as  provided in Article VII, and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

 

 

(b) _Assignment  of Purchased Units_.  All or  any portion of a Purchaser's
Purchased Units purchased pursuant to this  Agreement may be sold, assigned
or pledged by such Purchaser, subject to  compliance with applicable federal

Rights Agreement.

 

 

(c) _Assignment  of Rights_.  Each  Purchaser may assign all or any portion
of its rights and, with respect to  clause (iii) below, obligations under
this Agreement without the consent of  the  Partnership (i) to any Affiliate
of such Purchaser, (ii) in connection with  a  total return swap or similar
transaction with respect to the Purchased Units  purchased by such Purchaser,
or (iii) on or prior to June 1, 2007, to  shareholders of Momentum Energy
Group Inc. up to an aggregate of $20 million,  and in each case the assignee
shall be deemed to be a Purchaser hereunder with  respect to such assigned
rights and obligations and shall agree to be bound  by  the provisions of
this Agreement and shall execute and deliver to the  Partnership on or prior
to the Closing Date (or in the case of clause (iii)  above, on or prior to
June 1, 2007) a written instrument reasonably satisfactory  to the
Partnership pursuant to which the assignee shall make each of the 
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV to the Partnership
(such  instrument an, " _Assignment  and Assumption Agreement "_). 
Except  as expressly permitted by this _Section  8.04(c)_ ,  such  rights
and obligations may not otherwise be transferred except with the prior 
written consent of the Partnership (which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), in which case the assignee shall be deemed to be a Purchaser 
hereunder with respect to such assigned rights or obligations and shall
agree  to  be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and shall execute an
Assignment  and  Assumption Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, for the
purposes of clause  (iii) above, the execution and delivery of an Assignment
and Assumption  Agreement shall be deemed to be an effective amendment of
_Schedule  2.01_   without  any further action of the Parties,
notwithstanding _Section  8.03(b)_. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22

thereof. 

 

 

Section  8.07 _Communications_.  All  notices and demands provided for
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be  given by regular mail, registered

guaranteeing overnight delivery, electronic mail or  personal delivery to the
addresses listed in _Schedule  8.07_   of this  Agreement or to such other

recipient has read the message, if sent via electronic mail;  upon actual
receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt  requested,
or regular mail, if mailed; when receipt acknowledged, if sent via 
facsimile; and upon actual receipt when delivered to an air courier
guaranteeing  overnight delivery.

legend described in _Section  4.08_   from the  certificates evidencing the
Purchased Units at the request of a Purchaser  submitting to the Partnership
such certificates, together with an opinion of  counsel, if required by the
Partnership's transfer agent, to the effect that  such legend is no longer
required under the Securities Act or applicable state  securities Laws, as
the case may be, unless the Partnership, with the advice  of  counsel,
determines that such removal is inappropriate. 

 

 

Section  8.09 _Entire  Agreement_.  This  Agreement and the other Basic
Documents are intended by the Parties as a final  expression of their
agreement and intended to be a complete and exclusive  statement of the

such  Registrable Security is held by the Partnership or one of its
subsidiaries;  (e)  two years from the date on which the Shelf Registration
Statement contemplated  by _Section  2.01_   is  declared effective by the
Commission or (f) such Registrable Security has been  sold in a private
transaction in which the transferor's rights under this  Agreement are not
assigned to the transferee of such securities.

 

 

**ARTICLE  II**

 

**REGISTRATION  RIGHTS**

 

 

Section  2.01 _Shelf  Registration_.

 

 

(a) _Deadline  To Go Effective_.  As soon  as practicable following the
Closing, but in any event within 90 days of the  Closing, the Partnership
shall prepare and file a Shelf Registration Statement  under the Securities
Act with respect to all of the Registrable Securities.  The  Partnership
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf 
Registration Statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the 
date  of the Closing. The Partnership will use its commercially reasonable
efforts  to  cause the Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
_Section  2.01_   to be  continuously effective under the Securities Act
until the date on which all  such  Registrable Securities have ceased to be
Registrable Securities (the " _Effectiveness  Period_ ").  The  Shelf
Registration Statement when declared effective (including any documents 
incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material 
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange  Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to  state  a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the  statements therein not misleading.

 

 

(b) _Failure  To Go Effective_.  If the  Shelf Registration Statement
required by _Section  2.01_   is not  declared effective within 180 days
after Closing, then each Purchaser shall  be  entitled to a payment (with
respect to the Purchased Units of each such  Purchaser), as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, of 0.25% of the  Liquidated Damages Multiplier
per 30-day period for the first 60 days following  the 180th day, increasing
by an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages  Multiplier per 30-day
period for each subsequent 60 days, up to a maximum of  1.00% of the
Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period (the " _Liquidated  Damages_
").  The  Liquidated Damages payable pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall  be  payable  within ten Business Days after the end of each
such 30-day period. Any  Liquidated Damages shall be paid to each Purchaser
in immediately available  funds; _provided_ , _  however_ ,  if the 
Partnership certifies that it is unable to pay Liquidated Damages in cash 
because such payment would result in a breach under a credit facility or
other  debt instrument filed as exhibits to the SEC Documents, then the
Partnership  may  pay the Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the
issuance of additional  Common Units. Upon any issuance of Common Units as
Liquidated Damages, the  Partnership shall promptly prepare and file an
amendment to the Shelf  Registration Statement prior to its effectiveness
adding such Common Units  to  such Shelf Registration Statement as
additional Registrable Securities. The  determination of the number of Common
Units to be issued as Liquidated Damages  shall be equal to the amount of
Liquidated Damages divided by the average  closing price of the Partnership's
Common Units on the NYSE for the ten trading  days immediately preceding the
date on which the Liquidated Damages payment  is  due. The payment of the
Liquidated Damages to a Purchaser shall cease at such  time as the Purchased
Units of such Purchaser cease to be Registrable  Securities. As soon as
practicable following the date that the Shelf  Registration Statement becomes
effective, but in any event within three Business  Days of such date, the
Partnership shall provide the Purchasers with written  notice of the
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Waiver  of Liquidated Damages_.  If the  Partnership is unable to
cause a Shelf Registration Statement to go effective  within the 180 days as
a result of an acquisition, merger, reorganization,  disposition or other
similar transaction, then the Partnership may request  a  waiver of the
Liquidated Damages, and each Holder may individually  grant **** or 
withhold its  consent to such request in its reasonable discretion.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Purchaser 's Rights_.  A  Purchaser's rights (and any
transferee's rights pursuant to _Section  2.10_ )  under  this _Section 
2.01_   shall  terminate upon the termination of the Effectiveness Period.

 

 

(e) _Delay  Rights_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Partnership  may,  upon written notice to any Selling Holder
whose Registrable Securities are  included in the Shelf Registration
Statement, suspend such Selling Holder's use  of any prospectus which is a
part of the Shelf Registration Statement (in which  event the Selling Holder
shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities  pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement) if (i) the Partnership is pursuing  an acquisition,
merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction  and the
Partnership determines in good faith that the Partnership's ability to 
pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely
affected  by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf
Registration  Statement or (ii) the Partnership has experienced some other
material non-public  event the disclosure of which at such time, in the good
faith judgment of the  Partnership, would materially adversely affect the
Partnership; _provided,  however_ ,  in no  event shall the Purchasers be
suspended for a period that exceeds an aggregate  of 30 days in any 90-day
period or 90 days in any 365-day period, in each case,  exclusive of days
covered by any lock-up agreement executed by a Purchaser  in  connection
with any Underwritten Offering. Upon disclosure of such information  or the
termination of the condition described above, the Partnership shall  provide
prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are 
included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate 
any  suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other
actions  to  permit registered sales of Registrable Securities as
contemplated in this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Additional  Rights to Liquidated Damages_.  If (i)  the Holders shall
be prohibited from selling their Registrable Securities under  the
Registration Statement as a result of a suspension pursuant to _Section 
2.01(e)_   of this  Agreement in excess of the periods permitted therein or
(ii) the Registration  Statement is filed and declared effective but, during
the Effectiveness Period,  shall thereafter cease to be effective or fail to
be usable for its intended  purpose without being succeeded by a post-
effective amendment to the  Registration Statement, a supplement to the
prospectus or a report filed with  the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a),
13(c), 14 or l5(d) of the Exchange  Act, then, until the suspension is lifted
or a post-effective amendment,  supplement or report is filed with the
Commission, but not including any day  on  which a suspension is lifted or
such amendment, supplement or report is filed  and declared effective, if
applicable, the Partnership shall owe the Holders  an  amount equal to the
Liquidated Damages, following (x) the date on which the  suspension period
exceeded the permitted period under _Section  2.01(e)_   of this  Agreement
or (y) the day after the Registration Statement ceased to be effective  or
failed to be useable for its intended purposes, as liquidated damages and 
not  as a penalty. For purposes of this _Section  2.01(f)_ ,  a 
suspension shall be deemed lifted on the date that notice that the
suspension  has been lifted is delivered to the Holders pursuant to Section
3.01 of this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  2.02 _Piggyback  Rights_. 

 

 

(a) _Participation_.  If at  any time that is on or after 180 days after the
date of the Closing the  Partnership proposes to file (i) a prospectus
supplement to an effective shelf  registration statement, other than the
Shelf Registration Statement contemplated  by _Section  2.01_ ,  or (ii) 
a registration statement, other than a shelf registration statement, in
either  case, for the sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering for
its own  account and/or another Person, then as soon as practicable but not
less than  three (3) Business Days prior to the filing of (x) any preliminary
prospectus  supplement to a prospectus relating to such Underwritten Offering
pursuant  to  Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, (y) the prospectus
supplement to a  prospectus relating to such Underwritten Offering pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under  the Securities Act (if no preliminary prospectus
supplement is used) or (z)  such  registration statement, as the case may
be, the Partnership shall give notice  of  such proposed Underwritten
Offering to the Holders and such notice shall offer  the Holders the
opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering such number  of
Registrable Securities (the " _Included  Registrable Securities_ ")  as 
each such Holder may request in writing; _provided_ ,  that  each such
Holder shall keep all information relating to such Underwritten  Offering in
confidence and shall not make use of, disseminate or in any way  disclose any
such information; _provided,  however_ ,  that if  the Partnership has been
advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion  of Registrable
Securities for sale for the benefit of the Holders will have  a  material
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common  Units  in
the Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Registrable Securities to  be 
offered for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the
provisions  of _Section  2.02(b)_.  The  notice required to be provided in
this _Section  2.02(a)_   to  Holders shall be provided on a Business Day
pursuant to _Section  3.01_   hereof.  Each such Holder shall then have two
Business Days after receiving such notice  to request inclusion of
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering,  except that such Holder
shall have one Business Day after such Holder confirms  receipt of the notice
to request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the  Underwritten Offering
in the case of a "bought deal" or "overnight transaction" where no
preliminary prospectus is used. If no request for inclusion from a  Holder is
received within the specified time, each such Holder shall have no  further
right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time  after
giving written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten  Offering
and prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership 
shall determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such
Underwritten  Offering, the Partnership may, at its election, give written
notice of such  determination to the Selling Holders and, (x) in the case of
a determination  not  to undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be
relieved of its obligation  to  sell any Included Registrable Securities in
connection with such terminated  Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case
of a determination to delay such  Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted
to delay offering any Included  Registrable Securities for the same period as
the delay in the Underwritten  Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the
right to withdraw such Selling  Holder's request for inclusion of such
Selling Holder's Registrable Securities  in such offering by giving written
notice to the Partnership of such withdrawal  up to and including the time of
pricing of such offering. Each Holder's rights  under this _Section 
2.02(a)_   shall  terminate when such Holder (together with any Affiliates
of such Holder) holds  less than $15 million of Purchased Units, based on the
purchase price per unit  under the Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Holder holding  greater than $15 million of Purchased Units,
based on the purchase price per  unit under the Purchase Agreement, may
deliver written notice (an " _Opt  Out Notice_ ")  to the  Partnership
requesting that such Holder not receive notice from the Partnership  of any
proposed Underwritten Offering; _provided_ ,  that,  such Holder may later
revoke any such Opt Out Notice. Following receipt of  an  Opt Out Notice
from a Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the Partnership  shall not be
required to deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this  _Section 
2.02(a)_   and such  Holder shall no longer be entitled to participate in
Underwritten Offerings  by  the Partnership pursuant to this _Section 
2.02(a)_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Priority_.  If the  Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any
proposed Underwritten Offering  of  Common Units included in an Underwritten
Offering involving Included Registrable  Securities advises that the total
amount of Common Units that the Selling  Holders and any other Persons intend
to include in such offering exceeds the  number that can be sold in such
offering without being likely to have a material  adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Units offered  or the market for
the Common Units, then the Common Units to be included in  such 
Underwritten Offering shall include the number of Registrable Securities
that  such Managing Underwriter or Underwriters advises can be sold without
having  such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to
the  Partnership and (ii) second, pro rata among the Selling Holders party
to  this Agreement and any other Persons who have been or are granted
registration  rights on or after the date of this Agreement (including the
General Partner,  " _Other  Holders_ "),  in  each case, who have
requested participation in such Underwritten Offering.  The  pro rata
allocations for each such Selling Holder shall be the product of (a)  the
aggregate number of Common Units proposed to be sold by all Selling Holders 
and Other Holders in such Underwritten Offering multiplied by (b) the
fraction  derived by dividing (x) the number of Common Units owned on the
Registration  Deadline by such Selling Holder or Other Holder by (y) the
aggregate number  of  Common Units owned by all Selling Holders and Other
Holders participating in  the  Underwritten Offering. As of the date of
execution of this Agreement, there  are  no other Persons with Registration
Rights relating to Common Units other than  as  described in this _Section 
2.02(b)_   and as  set forth in the Partnership Agreement.

 

 

Section  2.03 _Underwritten  Offerings_.

 

 

(a) _Underwritten  Offering_.  Any one  or more Holders may deliver written
notice to the Partnership that such Holders  wish to dispose of Registrable
Securities under the Shelf Registration Statement  in an Underwritten
Offering if the Holders reasonably anticipate selling  collectively at least
$25 million of Common Units (calculated based on the  per  unit purchase
price of such Common Units). Upon receipt of such written request,  the
Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to retain underwriters 
and effect such sale through an Underwritten Offering and take all
commercially  reasonable actions as are reasonably requested by the Managing
Underwriter  or  underwriters to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable  Securities,  including entering into an underwriting
agreement;  _provided,  however_ ,  that  the Partnership shall not be
required to cause its management to participate  in  a "road show" or
similar marketing effort on behalf of any Holder. The  Partnership may elect
to include primary Common Units in any Underwritten  Offering undertaken
pursuant to this _Section  2.03(a)_.  In  addition, any Underwritten
Offering undertaken pursuant to this _Section  2.03_   will be  subject to
the provisions of _Section  2.02(b)_.

 

 

(b) _General  Procedures_.  In  connection with any Underwritten Offering
under this Agreement, the Partnership  shall be entitled to select the
Managing Underwriter or Underwriters. In  connection with an Underwritten
Offering contemplated by this Agreement in  which  a Selling Holder
participates, each Selling Holder and the Partnership shall  be  obligated
to enter into an underwriting agreement that contains such  representations,
covenants, indemnities and other rights and obligations as  are  customary
in underwriting agreements for firm commitment offerings of  securities. No
Selling Holder may participate in such Underwritten Offering  unless such
Selling Holder agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the  basis
provided in such underwriting agreement and completes and executes all 
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities and other documents
reasonably  required under the terms of such underwriting agreement. Each
Selling Holder  may, at its option, require that any or all of the
representations and  warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
the Partnership to  and  for the benefit of such underwriters also be made
to and for such Selling  Holder's benefit and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the  obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be  conditions precedent to its obligations. No
Selling Holder shall be required  to  make any representations or warranties
to or agreements with the Partnership  or  the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding  such Selling Holder, its
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement  and  to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf,  its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by  Law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such  Selling
Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to the Partnership  and 
the Managing Underwriter; _provided,  however_ ,  that  such withdrawal
must be made up to and including the time of pricing of such  Underwritten
Offering. No such withdrawal shall affect the Partnership's  obligation to
pay Registration Expenses. The Partnership's management may but  shall not be
required to participate in a roadshow or similar marketing effort  in
connection with any Underwritten Offering.

Section  2.04 _Sale  Procedures_.  In  connection with its obligations
under this _Article  II_ ,  the  Partnership will, as expeditiously as
possible:

 

 

(a) prepare  and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Shelf  Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may  be  necessary to keep the Shelf Registration Statement
effective for the  Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply
with the provisions  of  the Securities Act with respect to the disposition
of all securities covered  by  the Shelf Registration Statement;

 

 

(b) if  a  prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the
marketing of an  Underwritten Offering from the Shelf Registration Statement
and the Managing  Underwriter at any time shall notify the Partnership in
writing that, in the  sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion
of detailed information  to  be used in such prospectus supplement is of
material importance to the success  of the Underwritten Offering of such
Registrable Securities, the Partnership  shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to include such information in  such prospectus
supplement;

 

 

(c) furnish  to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before  filing the Shelf Registration Statement or  any  other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement  or any  supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete  drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each  document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the  rules
and regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder  the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder 
and its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the
corrections  reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such
information  prior to filing the Shelf Registration Statement or such other
registration  statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies  of  the Shelf Registration Statement or such other
registration statement and the  prospectus included therein and any
supplements and amendments thereto as such  Persons may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the public sale or other  disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Shelf Registration  Statement or such other
registration statement;

 

 

(d) if  applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify  the  Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement or any other  registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
under the securities  or  blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling
Holders or, in the case  of an  Underwritten Offering, the Managing
Underwriter, shall reasonably request;  _provided,  however_ ,  that  the
Partnership will not be required to qualify generally to transact business 
in any jurisdiction where it is not then required to so qualify or to take 
any  action which would subject it to general service of process in any
such  jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

 

 

(e) promptly  notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus  relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i)  the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement or 
any  other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement  or any 
prospectus or prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or 
any  amendment or supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Shelf
Registration  Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement  or  any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has
become effective; and  (ii) any written comments from the Commission with
respect to any filing  referred to in clause (i) and any written request by
the Commission for  amendments or supplements to the Shelf Registration
Statement or any other  registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
or any prospectus or  prospectus supplement thereto;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) immediately  notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus  relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of (i)  the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus  supplement contained in the Shelf Registration
Statement or  any  other registration statement contemplated by this
Agreement,  as then  in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state  any  material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing; (ii)  the  issuance or threat of issuance by
the Commission of any stop order suspending  the effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement or  any  other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement,  or the  initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; or
(iii) the receipt by the  Partnership of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the  qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under
the applicable  securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following
the provision of  such  notice, the Partnership agrees to as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement  the prospectus or prospectus supplement or
take other appropriate action so  that  the prospectus or prospectus
supplement does not include an untrue statement  of  a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading in the light of  the  circumstances
then existing and to take such other action as is necessary to  remove a stop
order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related  thereto;

 

 

(g) in  the  case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request, (i) an
opinion of  counsel for the Partnership, dated the effective date of the
applicable  registration statement or the date of any amendment or supplement
thereto,  and a  letter of like kind dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting  agreement, and (ii) a "cold comfort" letter, dated the pricing
date of such  Underwritten Offering and a letter of like kind dated the date
of the closing  under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the
independent public  accountants who have certified the Partnership's
financial statements included  or incorporated by reference into the
applicable registration statement, and  each of the opinion and the "cold
comfort" letter shall be in customary form and  covering substantially the
same matters with respect to such registration  statement (and the prospectus
and any prospectus supplement included therein)  as  have been customarily
covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in  accountants' letters
delivered to the underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of  securities by the
Partnership and such other matters as such underwriters and  Selling Holders
may reasonably request;

 

 

(h) otherwise  use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules  and  regulations of the Commission, and make available to
its security holders,  as  soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings
statement, which earnings statement  shall satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule  158  promulgated thereunder;

 

 

(i) make  available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and  Selling Holders access to such information and Partnership
personnel as is  reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish
a due diligence  defense under the Securities Act;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) cause  all  such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed  on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which  similar securities issued by the Partnership are
then listed;

 

 

(k) use  its  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be  registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities  as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Partnership  to enable the Selling Holders to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable  Securities;

 

 

(l) provide  a  transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by such  registration statement not later than the effective date of
such registration  statement;

 

 

(m) enter  into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably  requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to  expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;  and

 

 

(n) the  Partnership agrees that, if any Purchaser could reasonably be deemed
to be  an "underwriter", as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities
Act, in  connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, in addition to its
obligations  set forth in paragraph (i) above, at any Purchaser's request,
(A) the  Partnership will furnish to such Purchaser, on the date of the
effectiveness  of  the Shelf Registration Statement and thereafter from time
to time on such dates  as such Purchaser may reasonably request, an opinion
of counsel for the  Partnership and, to the extent practicable, a "cold
comfort" letter signed by  the independent public accountants who have
certified the Partnership's  financial statements included or incorporated by
reference into the Shelf  Registration Statement, and each of the opinion and
"cold comfort" letter shall  be in customary form and covering substantially
the same matters with respect to  the Shelf Registration Statement as have
been customarily covered in opinions  of  issuer's counsel and accountants'
letters delivered to the underwriters in  Underwritten Offerings of
securities of the Partnership and (B) the  Partnership will also permit legal
counsel to such Purchaser to review and  comment upon the Shelf Registration
Statement at least five Business Days prior  to its filing with the
Commission and all amendments and supplements thereto  (excluding any filings
made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and  incorporated therein by
reference) within a reasonable time period prior to  their filing with the
Commission and not file any Shelf Registration Statement  or amendment or
supplement thereto (excluding any filings made under the  Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and incorporated therein by reference) in a  form  to which such
Purchaser's legal counsel reasonably objects.

 

 

Each  Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening  of  any event of the kind described in subsection (f) of this
_Section  2.04_ ,  shall  forthwith discontinue disposition of the
Registrable Securities until such  Selling Holder's receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus  contemplated by subsection (f) of
this _Section  2.04_   or until  it is advised in writing by the
Partnership that the use of the prospectus  may  be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings  incorporated by
reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the  Partnership, such
Selling Holder will, or will request the managing underwriter  or
underwriters, if any, to deliver to the Partnership (at the Partnership's 
expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than permanent
file  copies then in such Selling Holder's possession, of the prospectus
covering such  Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of
such  notice.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  2.05 _Cooperation  by Holders_.  The  Partnership shall have no
obligation to include in the Shelf Registration  Statement, or in an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section  2.2(a)_ ,  Common  Units of a
Selling Holder who has failed to timely furnish such information  that, in
the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, is reasonably required  in  order
for the registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable,  to 
comply with the Securities Act.

 

 

Section  2.06 _Restrictions  on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_.  For one  year following the Closing Date, each Holder of
Registrable Securities who  is  included in the Shelf Registration Statement
agrees not to effect any public  sale or distribution of the Registrable
Securities during the 30-day period  following completion of an Underwritten
Offering of equity securities by the  Partnership (except as provided in this
_Section  2.06_ );  _provided,  however_ ,  that  the duration of the
foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than the duration  of the shortest
restriction generally imposed by the underwriters on the  officers or
directors or any other unitholder of the Partnership on whom a  restriction
is imposed. In  addition, the lock-up provisions in this _Section  2.06_  
shall  not apply with respect to a Holder that (A) owns less than $15 million
of  Purchased Units, based on the purchase price per unit under the
Purchase  Agreement, (B) has delivered an Opt Out Notice to the Partnership
pursuant  to  _Section  2.02(a)_   or (C)  has submitted a notice
requesting the inclusion of Registrable Securities in  an  Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section  2.02(a)_   but is  unable to do so as a
result of the priority provisions contained in _Section  2.02(b)_.

 

 

Section  2.07 _Expenses_.

 

 

(a) _Expenses_.  The  Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration
Expenses as determined in  good  faith, including, in the case of an
Underwritten Offering, whether or not any  sale is made pursuant to such
Underwritten Offering. Each Selling Holder shall  pay all Selling Expenses in
connection with any sale of its Registrable  Securities hereunder. In
addition, except as otherwise provided in _Section  2.08_   hereof,  the
Partnership shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by Holders  in 
connection with the exercise of such Holders' rights hereunder.

 

 

(b) _Certain  Definitions_.  " _Registration  Expenses_ " means  all
expenses incident to the Partnership's performance under or compliance with 
this Agreement to effect the registration of Registrable Securities on the 
Shelf  Registration Statement pursuant to _Section  2.01_   or an 
Underwritten Offering covered under this Agreement, and the disposition of 
such  securities, including, without limitation, all registration, filing,
securities  exchange listing and NYSE fees, all registration, filing,
qualification and  other fees and expenses of complying with securities or
blue sky laws (other  than fees and expenses of counsel to the Managing
Underwriter in connection  with  an Underwritten Offering), fees of the

Section  2.08 _Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) _By  the  Partnership_.  In the  event of a registration of any
Registrable Securities under the Securities  Act  pursuant to this
Agreement, the Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless  each Selling
Holder thereunder, its directors, officers, employees and agents,  and each
underwriter, pursuant to the applicable underwriting agreement with  such
underwriter, of Registrable Securities thereunder and each Person, if  any, 
who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act
and  the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents,
against  any  losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including
reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), 
joint  or several, to which such Selling Holder, director, officer, employee,
agent  or  underwriter or controlling Person may become subject under the
Securities Act,  the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or
actions or  proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out  of  or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any  material fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement
or any other  registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary  prospectus, free writing prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein,  or  any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of
or are based upon the  omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of  a  prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not  misleading, and will reimburse
each such Selling Holder, its directors,  officers, employee and agents, each
such underwriter and each such controlling  Person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection  with investigating or
defending any such Loss or actions or proceedings;  _provided,  however_ , 
that  the Partnership will not be liable in any such case if and to the
extent that  any such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement
or alleged  untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in
conformity with  information furnished by such Selling Holder, its directors,
officers, employees  and agents or any underwriter or such controlling Person
in writing specifically  for use in the Shelf Registration Statement or such
other registration statement  contemplated by this Agreement, or any
preliminary prospectus, free writing  prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement  thereto, as applicable.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect  regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder  or  any such
directors, officers, employees agents or any underwriter or controlling 
Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling 
Holder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _By  Each Selling Holder_.  Each  Selling Holder agrees severally and
not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless  the Partnership, its directors,
officers, employees and agents and each Person,  if any, who controls the
Partnership within the meaning of the Securities Act  or  of the Exchange
Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to  the  same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling  Holders, but
only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder  furnished in
writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for  inclusion in
the Shelf Registration Statement or any other registration  statement
contemplated by this Agreements, or any preliminary prospectus, free  writing
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment  or 
supplement thereto.

 

 

(c) _Notice_.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the  commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect  thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the  indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the
omission so to notify the  indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have  to  any indemnified party other than under this
_Section  2.08_.  In any  action brought against any indemnified party, it
shall notify the indemnifying  party of the commencement thereof. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled  to  participate in and, to the extent
it shall wish, to assume and undertake the  defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party  and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of  its  election so to assume
and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party  shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under this _Section  2.08_   for any 
legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection 
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of 
liaison with counsel so selected; _provided,  however_ ,  that,  (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel 
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in 
any  such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
party and  counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there
may be  reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are
different from  or additional to those available to the indemnifying party,
or if the interests  of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to
conflict with the interests  of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified
party shall have the right  to  select a separate counsel and to assume such
legal defense and otherwise to  participate in the defense of such action,
with the reasonable expenses and  fees  of such separate counsel and other
reasonable expenses related to such  participation to be reimbursed by the
indemnifying party as incurred.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no indemnified party  shall settle any action brought against it
with respect to which it is entitled  to indemnification hereunder without
the consent of the indemnifying party,  unless the settlement thereof imposes
no liability or obligation on, and  includes a complete and unconditional
release from all liability of, the  indemnifying party.

 

 

(d) _Contribution_.  If the  indemnification provided for in this _Section 
2.08_   is held  by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction
to be unavailable  to  any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them
harmless in respect of  any  Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such  indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such  indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such
proportion as is appropriate  to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and  of  such indemnified party on the
other in connection with the statements or  omissions which resulted in such
Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations; _provided, 
however_ ,  that in  no event shall such Selling Holder be required to
contribute an aggregate amount  in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds
(net of Selling Expenses) received  by  such Selling Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities giving rise to  such  indemnification. The relative
fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand  and the indemnified party on
the other shall be determined by reference to,  among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material  fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact has been  made  by, or relates to,
information supplied by such party, and the parties' relative  intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent  such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just 
and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be
determined  by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not  take  account of the equitable considerations referred to herein.
The amount paid  by  an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred
to in the first sentence  of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any
legal and other expenses  reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating  or defending any Loss which is the subject of
this paragraph. No person guilty  of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the  Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not  guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) _Other  Indemnification_.  The  provisions of this _Section  2.08_  
shall be  in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution
which an  indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or 
otherwise.

 

 

Section  2.09 _Rule  144 Reporting_.  With a  view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the  Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public  without registration,
the Partnership agrees to use its commercially reasonable  efforts to:

 

 

(a) Make  and  keep public information regarding the Partnership available,
as those terms  are  understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities
Act, at all times from  and after the date hereof;

 

 

(b) File  with  the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required  of  the Partnership under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times  from  and after the date hereof; and

 

 

(c) So  long  as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such
Holder forthwith  upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the  Partnership, and such other reports and documents so filed as
such Holder may  reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the  Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such
securities without  registration.

 

 

Section  2.10 _Transfer  or Assignment of Registration Rights_.  The 
rights to cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted 
to  the Purchasers by the Partnership under this _Article  II_   may be 
transferred or assigned by any Purchaser to one or more transferee(s) or 
assignee(s) of such Registrable Securities; _provided,  however_ ,  that 
(a) unless such transferee is an Affiliate or a swap counterpart of such 
Purchaser, each such transferee or assignee holds Registrable Securities 
representing at least $15 million of the Purchased Units, based on the
purchase  price per unit under the Purchase Agreement, (b) the Partnership is
given  written notice prior to any said transfer or assignment, stating the
name and  address of each such transferee and identifying the securities with
respect  to  which such registration rights are being transferred or
assigned, and (c) each  such transferee assumes in writing responsibility for
its portion of the  obligations of such Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

 

Section  2.11 _Limitation  on Subsequent Registration Rights_.  From  and
after the date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior written 
consent of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding Registrable
Securities,  enter into any agreement with any current or future holder of
any securities  of  the Partnership that would allow such current or future
holder to require the  Partnership to include securities in any registration
statement filed by the  Partnership on a basis that is superior in any way to
the piggyback rights  granted to the Purchasers hereunder.
