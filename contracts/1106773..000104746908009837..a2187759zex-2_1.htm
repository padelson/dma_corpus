<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), dated as of September&nbsp;1, 2008,
among Shionogi&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.,&nbsp;Ltd., a company formed under the laws of Japan ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), Tall Bridge,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation
and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger Sub</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and Sciele Pharma,&nbsp;Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this
Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company
Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") issued and outstanding (each share of Company Common Stock, a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Share</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and, collectively, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), at a price per Share of $31.00 (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Merger</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>DGCL</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in
Section&nbsp;2.5(b) and Section&nbsp;2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
(i)&nbsp;certain of the Company's directors and executive officers are entering into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub substantially in the form attached as </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Exhibit&nbsp;B</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Tender and Voting Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), and (ii)&nbsp;certain of the Company's executive
officers are entering into amended and restated employment agreements with the Company. </FONT></P>

Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as
promptly as practicable after any such Shares are tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11(c) promulgated under the Exchange

in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information

the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parent's request, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance
Time, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, if a Company
Stockholders Meeting is required, prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement, if a
Company Stockholders Meeting is required, and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. If at any time prior to
receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail
to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be

practicable following the Acceptance Time, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Stockholders

Agreement (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Voting Proposal</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") by the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii)&nbsp;the
Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Company's stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section&nbsp;6.8, the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the Required Company Stockholder Vote and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the
Company required by the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market&nbsp;LLC or the DGCL to obtain such approvals. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligations under
Section&nbsp;6.1(a) shall not be affected by (i)&nbsp;the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii)&nbsp;the withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after
consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A)&nbsp;to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Company's stockholders, (B)&nbsp;if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder's Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient
Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting, or (C)&nbsp;for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent, Merger Sub and any other Parent subsidiary shall collectively acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all necessary

individuals than the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, for a period of not less than six (6)&nbsp;years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related
to actions or omissions of such officers and directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions) in their capacities as such, whether asserted or

obtain a six (6)&nbsp;year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the D&amp;O Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions
