AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of September 1, 2008, among Shionogi and Co., Ltd., a company formed under the laws of Japan (" _Parent_ "), Tall Bridge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Sciele Pharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. 

  

    
 _Recitals 
_

  

 A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 B. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each share of Company Common Stock, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $31.00 (such amount, or any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 C. Following consummation of the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section 2.6, will thereupon be cancelled and converted in the Merger into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

  

 D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i) certain of the Company\'s directors and executive officers are entering into a Tender and Voting Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Tender and Voting Agreement_ "), and (ii) certain of the Company\'s executive officers are entering into amended and restated employment agreements with the Company. 

   

 E. In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER 

  

 Section 1.1 _ _ _The Offer._ 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence the Offer, within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, purchase, accept for payment, and pay for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Annex A (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). 

  

 (b) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on the initial expiration date or any subsequent date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, all of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived, then Merger      
  

Sub shall, subject to the rights of the parties under Article 8, extend (and
re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial expiration
date or such other date for one or more periods, until the earlier to occur
of (i) a date as of which all of the Offer Conditions, including the Minimum
Tender Condition, are satisfied or waived and (ii) the Walk Away Date;
provided that any such extension shall be in increments determined by Merger
Sub of not more than ten (10) Business Days. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for
any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
any other Law. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date
(as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with
this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Article 8\.

  

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable following the later of: (i) the earliest date as of which Merger Sub is permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived. 

   

 (d) Merger Sub may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") following the Acceptance Time if at the commencement of any Subsequent Offering Period (or extension thereof) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries (including any Shares beneficially owned by any of the foregoing) represent less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares. If immediately following the Acceptance Time, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries own more than 80% but less than 90% of the Shares outstanding at that time (which shall include (i) shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) shares tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn), to the extent requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall provide for a Subsequent Offering Period of at least ten (10) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option would, after giving effect to such exercise and when added to the number of Shares so owned by the Parent, Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries, represent not less than 90% of the then outstanding number of Shares, at the Parent\'s election, the Merger Sub shall not be required to provide for such Subsequent Offering Period. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn during such Subsequent Offering Period as promptly as practicable after any such Shares are tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period and in any event in compliance with Rule 14d-11(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 (a) Subject to applicable Law and applicable marketplace rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC applicable to the Company at such time, promptly upon the acceptance for payment of and payment by Merger Sub for Shares pursuant to the Offer satisfying the Minimum Tender Condition (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), and as long as Parent directly or indirectly beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding Shares, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) the number of Shares owned by Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (B) the total number of Shares that are issued and outstanding. The Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause such persons designated by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company Board of (I) each committee of the Company Board, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws and the marketplace rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, and (II) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and each committee of such board of directors (or similar body); provided, however, that in the event that Merger Sub\'s designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall retain from the directors who are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not also officers of the Company, such number of "independent directors" (as defined by the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC) as may be required by such rules or U.S. federal securities laws (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); and provided further that, in such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below such required number for any reason whatsoever, the Company Board shall cause the Person(s) designated by the remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy(ies), and such person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall designate persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions available to the
Company to cause the Merger Sub\'s designees to be so elected or appointed.

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder and to the then applicable rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to the Company\'s stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9, as contemplated by Section 1.2(b)) as is necessary to fulfill the Company\'s obligations under Section 1.3(a); provided, that Parent and Merger Sub shall have timely supplied to the Company in writing, and shall be solely responsible for, any information with respect to Parent, Merger Sub and such designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.4 _ _ _Option to Acquire Additional Shares._ 

   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable in accordance with this Section 1.4, to purchase the number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the number of Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub in whole but not in part. 

  

 (b) In no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable: (i) for a number of Shares in excess of the Company\'s then authorized and unissued Shares (including as authorized and unissued shares of 

        
  

Common Stock, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any Shares held in the
treasury of the Company and any Shares reserved for issuance, other than any
Shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, upon
the exercise of any outstanding Option or with respect to any other
outstanding security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
Shares), or (ii) if the exercise of the Top-Up Option would require the sale
of 20% or more of the capital stock of the Company requiring approval of the
holders of the Company\'s Shares pursuant to the rules of The NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC (and a waiver of or exemption from such requirement is not
obtained, it being understood and agreed that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver or exemption in order to
be able to issue the Top-Up Option Shares without obtaining approval of the
holders of the Company\'s Shares).

  

 (c) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub at any time at or after the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any subsequent offering period and on or prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day after the later of (i) the expiration date of the Offer or (ii) the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period; provided, however, that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (A) no provision of any applicable Law, and no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub constitutes one share more than 90% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser covenants to cause the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable following the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; and, provided, further, that the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with any termination of this Agreement. 

  

 (d) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent with all applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act. If Merger Sub wishes to so exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice thereof specifying a place and time for the closing of such purchase (which, subject to applicable Law and any required regulatory approvals, shall be effected as promptly as practicable and not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of delivery of such written notice). At such closing, (i) the purchase price in respect of the Top-Up Option Shares purchased upon such exercise of the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the product of (x) the number of Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (y) the Offer Price) shall be paid to the Company, at Merger Sub\'s election, either (A) in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company or (B) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Option Shares and by delivering Parent\'s unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable promissory note in the principal amount of the balance of such purchase price, which promissory note shall bear interest at the greater of: (i) the applicable short term federal rate per annum (as periodically set by the IRS), and (ii) 3%, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date thereof, and may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty, and (ii) the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing the number of Top-Up Option Shares so purchased. 

       

                                    

    

  (e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option
Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not
be registered under the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon
an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares shall
include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

In addition, subject to Section 6.9 hereof, Parent shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of Merger Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior 

        
  

to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed and

 (c) If requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the directors of each of the Company Subsidiaries (or certain of the Company Subsidiaries as indicated by Parent) to tender their resignations as directors, effective as of the Effective Time, and to deliver to Parent written evidence of such resignations at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.4 _ _ _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.7, without interest. 

  

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 2.6 _ _ _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5(a). The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any 

        
  

Shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.7(a) to pay for Shares
that are instead paid fair value in an appraisal proceeding pursuant to
Section 262 shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

 Section 2.7 _ _ _Exchange of Certificates._ 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent. _Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.7. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Merger Sub to, deposit with the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration and to pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.8 below (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available); provided, further, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parent\'s obligation under this Agreement. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.

Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Company\'s Knowledge, any other party to any Company Material Contract has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of such Company Material Contract, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries has received notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under any Company Material Contract, except for breaches, violations or defaults which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries, holds a valid leasehold interest in each Company Lease except for any invalidity that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No party has a right to occupy any of the premises subject to a Company Lease except for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there are not pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, condemnation or eminent domain actions or proceedings, or any special assessments or other activities of any public or quasi-public body, with respect to any Company Lease that, individually or in the aggregate, have had and would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE 6 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

  

 Section 6.1 _ _ _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings._ 

   

 (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares is required by Law, the Company shall, at Parent\'s request, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC and its staff with respect thereto. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review the Proxy Statement, if a Company Stockholders Meeting is required, prior to its being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement, if a Company Stockholders Meeting is required, and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. If at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Shares as promptly as practicable after filing with the SEC and resolution of any comments thereon from the SEC or its staff. 

  

 (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares is required by Law, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall at Parent\'s request, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Required Company Stockholder Vote. Subject to Section 6.8, (i) the Company Board shall recommend adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Voting Proposal_ ") by the stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) the Company Board shall not withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to Section 6.8, the Company shall take all action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Required Company Stockholder Vote and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the stockholders of the Company required by the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC or the DGCL to obtain such approvals. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company\'s obligations under Section 6.1(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board of its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company\'s stockholders, (B) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder\'s Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting, or (C) for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent, Merger Sub and any other Parent subsidiary shall collectively acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all necessary and appropriate action to 

        

cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Offer without a
stockholders meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  

 (c) At the Company Stockholders Meeting, if the same is required, Parent shall cause all Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer and all other Shares beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiary to be present so as to be counted for quorum purposes and voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.2 _ _ _Employee Benefits Matters._ 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Employee Benefit Plans of the Company (excluding the Stock Plans to be terminated at the Effective Time in accordance herewith) and all employment, severance and termination plans and agreements, in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "): (i) an annual base salary, bonus, commissions, annual and long-term cash incentive opportunity in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of such employee\'s annual base salary, bonus, commissions, annual and long-term cash incentive opportunity and the value of equity-based compensation provided to such employees immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided to such employee immediately before the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and benefits accrual (other than vesting under any incentive plan and accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the Company Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to applicable Law, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans except to the extent any waiting time in effect under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time would not have been satisfied, and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Employee Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an agreement providing for severance benefits) is terminated during the first eighteen months following the Effective Time under circumstances under which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the 

        
  

Company\'s severance practices as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Company Severance Practices_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide such Company Employee with severance
benefits that are equal to the severance benefits that would have been paid to
such Company Employee under the Company Severance Practices as in existence
on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent may condition such
Company Employee\'s entitlement to such severance benefits on such Company
Employee\'s execution of a release of claims in favor of Parent, the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates. Company\'s Section
6.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a description of the
Company\'s Severance Practices.

  

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" such Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or other agreement, plan, program, or document. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall obligate Parent to employ any person for any period of time after the Effective Time, and this Section 6.2 shall not be construed to limit the ability of Parent to alter the terms and conditions of, or terminate, the employment of any person (other than with respect to compensation and benefits as provided expressly in this Section 6.2). Without limiting the generality of Section 9.6(b), nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be construed as giving any Person (including any Company Employee or dependent or beneficiary thereof) any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Section 6.2.

 (b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent shall cause (including by making funds available, as necessary) the Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and shall advance each Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines as such expenses are incurred, but subject to the Indemnifying Party\'s receipt of an unsecured undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided that nothing herein shall impair any rights to indemnification of any Indemnified Party referred to in clause (a) above.

Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by causing the Surviving Corporation to obtain a six (6) year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to such former directors or officers than the DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 6.9(c).

 (e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the written consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9).

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written notice
of such termination to the other party, setting forth in such notice the
provision of this Section 8.1 pursuant to which such party is terminating

The Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Section 8.3 _ _ _Fees and Expenses._ 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $25,000,000.00 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

(ii)

 (iii)

 by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), so long as, in either such case, (A) before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to the Company Board or the holders of Company Common Stock and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date of termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement for any Takeover Proposal or recommended to holders of Company Common Stock a Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether made before or after the termination of this Agreement); or  


(iv)

 by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) as a result of a willful breach of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements by the Company, so long as (A) before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been communicated to the Company Board or the holders of Company Common Stock and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date of termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement for any Takeover Proposal or recommended to holders of Company Common Stock a Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether made before or after the termination of this Agreement); 
  

  

 _provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this Section 8.3(b), all
references to "20%" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed
to be references to "50%." Any fee due under Section 8.3(b)(i) shall be paid
to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business Days
after the date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee under Section
8.3(b)(ii) shall be paid to the Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds

 (c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Payment of the fees described in this Section 8.3 shall be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of a breach of this Agreement and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with any termination of this Agreement for which such fees are payable; provided, that the foregoing limitation of remedies shall not apply in the event of a willful breach by the Company of this Agreement, except where such willful breach gives rise to the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f) (in which event the Termination Fee payable under section 8.3(b)(iv) shall if paid constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent and Merger Sub.) 

  

 Section 8.4 _ _ _Amendment._ Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the respective Boards of Directors or stockholders of the parties hereto; provided, however, that after any such adoption by the holders of Shares, no amendment shall be made that, by applicable Law, requires further approval of such stockholders, without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or 

        
  

warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

 Section 8.6 _ _ _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Merger Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee of its Board of Directors.
