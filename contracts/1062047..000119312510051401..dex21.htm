and receipt of services by one party to or from the other, as necessary to service the Retained Contracts or the Customer Contracts assigned to the Purchaser, as applicable, (the &#147;Reciprocal Agreement&#148;). The parties hereto further
acknowledge and agree that (a)&nbsp;they intend for the Customer Contracts assigned to the Purchaser and the Retained Contracts to continue to be serviced after the Closing in the same manner as they were serviced immediately prior to the Closing
and that the people, systems and other assets utilized to service such contracts be able to continue to be used in the same manner after Closing as immediately before Closing as seamlessly as possible to avoid any disruption in client service, and
(b)&nbsp;the Reciprocal Agreement shall be drafted to reflect such intent. The Reciprocal Agreement shall contain substantially similar terms as the Transition Services Agreement with respect to duration, price, payment terms, liability,
indemnification and general provisions and other terms, such as description of services and service metrics as are reasonably appropriate under the circumstances, taking into account that each party will likely be both a provider and recipient of
services and each needs to meet its respective customer contractual obligations. The Reciprocal Agreement will be negotiated by the Sellers and the Purchaser in good faith between the date of this Agreement and the Closing and shall be executed by
the appropriate parties at the Closing; provided, however, that the execution of the Reciprocal Agreement shall not be a condition to the Purchaser&#146;s or the Sellers&#146; obligation to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
The parties hereto agree that, within fourteen (14)&nbsp;days following the date of this Agreement, they shall begin exchanging drafts of the Reciprocal Agreement and shall make their respective business, financial, technology and legal personnel
(including outside legal and accounting personnel) available, as necessary, to negotiate and finalize the Reciprocal Agreement on an expedited basis. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT
