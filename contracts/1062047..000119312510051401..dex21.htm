consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by Contract or otherwise.

commercial banks are not required or authorized to close in Cincinnati, Ohio

" _Business Material Adverse Effect_ " means any circumstance, event, change
or effect (whether or not foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement) that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other circumstances, events, changes
and effects, (i) is materially adverse to the assets, financial condition or
results of operations of the Business taken as a whole (whether or not such
circumstance, event, change or effect has, during the period or at any time in
question, manifested itself in the historical financial statements of the
Business), or (ii) would prevent or materially impair the ability of any
Seller to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement or
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of clause (i), any such effect resulting or arising from
any of the following matters shall not be considered when determining whether
a Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would be reasonably likely
to occur: (a) the general conditions in the industries in which the Business
operates, including competition in any of the geographic areas in which any of
the Sellers operates; (b) general economic or financial market conditions;
(c) any act of civil unrest, war or terrorism; (d) any conditions resulting
from natural or manmade disasters or other Acts of God (other than such
conditions that result in the destruction, loss or diminution of value of

(e) compliance by the Sellers with their covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement; (f) the failure of the financial or operating performance of
the Sellers to meet internal or analyst projections or budgets for any period

or omitted to be taken by or at the written request or with the written
consent of the Purchaser; (h) the announcement of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; or (i) changes in any Laws or GAAP;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any circumstance, event, change and
effect referred to in clauses (a) or (b) immediately above shall be taken
into account in determining whether a Business Material Adverse Effect has
occurred to the extent (but only to the extent) that such event, change or
effect has a disproportionate effect on the Business as a whole, compared to
other participants in the human resource outsourcing business.

" _Contamination_ " means the emission, discharge or release of any Hazardous
Material to, on, onto or into the environment and the effects of such
emission, discharge or release, including the presence, existence,
or threatened presence or existence of any such Hazardous Material.

" _Contract_ " means any written contract, lease, license, loan or credit
agreement, indenture, agreement, commitment or other legally binding written
arrangement, and all modifications, amendments, supplements and the like with
respect thereto.

_"Co-owned Property"_ shall have the meaning of such term set forth in the
Retained Business Maintenance Agreement. 

" _Covered Loss_ " means any and all losses (excluding loss in future profits,
other than any such loss in future profits arising from a Customer Contract,
which loss in future profits shall be included as a Covered Loss but only to
the extent such loss in future profits can be reasonably demonstrated by
Purchaser and only up to a maximum amount of the product of (i) the sum of

6.17), and (B) the principal payments paid or owed under the Deferred Payment

\- 3 -  the Aggregate Assigned Contribution Margin represented by the Contribution

related to such Customer Contract; provided, further, that the Purchaser shall
not be entitled to recover the duplicative portion of any loss in future
profits related to a Customer Contract and any other loss related to such
Customer Contract in connection with the same event, circumstances or breach),
liabilities (excluding contingent liabilities), claims, fines, deficiencies,
damages, obligations, Taxes, payments (including those arising out of any
settlement, judgment or compromise relating to any Proceeding), reasonable
costs and expenses (including interest and penalties due and payable with
respect thereto and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and any other
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing,
defending, avoiding or settling any Proceeding), in each case that are due and
payable, including any of the foregoing arising under, out of or in
connection with any Proceeding, Judgment or award of any arbitrator of any
kind, or any Law or Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that Covered Loss
excludes any loss or liability having an aggregate value of less than
$100,000, and any loss or liability that has been accrued for or reserved
against in the Financial Statements (to the extent of such accrual or reserve)
and any loss or liability specifically included in the Final Working Capital
Statement and taken into account in determining the Purchase Price adjustment
under Section 2.08. The amount of any Covered Loss subject to indemnification
hereunder shall be calculated net of (a) any net insurance proceeds received
by the indemnitee on account of such Covered Loss (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, (i) excluding any proceeds received by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates from any professional indemnity insurance policy held by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates and described on _Schedule 1.01(a)_ of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules (the " _Purchaser Professional Indemnity
Insurance Policy_ "), (ii) excluding any proceeds received by the Purchaser
under its warranty and indemnity insurance policy set forth on _Schedule
1.01(a)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules for claims in excess of the
limit of the Sellers liability in Section 9.02(c), and (iii) taking into
account costs of collection under any insurance policy) and (b) any net Tax
benefit actually realized by the indemnitee arising from the recognition of
the Covered Loss (but taking into account any Tax cost of receiving any
indemnification) and any other payment received with respect to a Covered
Loss. The indemnitee shall seek full recovery from any third parties and under
all insurance policies (other than the Purchaser Professional Indemnity
Insurance Policy, for which indemnitee shall have no obligation to make a
claim thereunder) covering any Covered Loss to the same extent as it would if
such Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. In the event any payment is made in respect of Covered Losses,
the indemnitor who made such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to any related rights of recovery of the indemnitee receiving
such payment against any third party; provided, however, that any indemnitor
exercising such subrogation rights shall consult in good faith with the
indemnitee prior to and during the course of seeking any recovery. In the
event that an insurance (other than with respect to the Purchaser Professional
Indemnity Insurance Policy) or other recovery is made or a net Tax benefit is
actually realized by the indemnitee with respect to any Covered Loss for which
it has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount
of the recovery or benefit shall be made promptly to the indemnitor
that provided such indemnification to the indemnitee; provided, however, that
such refund shall not exceed the aggregate amount of indemnity payments made
by the indemnitee to the indemnitor with respect to such Covered Loss.

2.07 _Closing and Post-Closing Consent Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Purchase Price reflects the
aggregate purchase price the Purchaser is willing to pay in return for one
hundred percent (100%) of the Customer Contracts and the Purchased Assets
related thereto. The parties hereto recognize that certain consents from
third parties are necessary to permit the acquisition by the Purchaser of a
portion of the Purchased Assets. If the Sellers are able to transfer to the
Purchaser at Closing, Customer Contracts representing at least seventy
percent (70%), but less than one hundred percent (100%), of the Aggregate
Contribution Margin, the Closing Purchase Price (prior to any adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or Section 2.08) shall be reduced by One Million
Four Hundred Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,416,667)
for each one percent (1%) by which one hundred percent (100%) exceeds the
percentage of Aggregate Contribution Margin represented by the Customer
Contracts transferred to the Purchaser at Closing. In addition, the Closing
Purchase Price may be increased following Closing pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Section 6.17. For purposes of this Agreement, the parties to
this Agreement agree that (a) _"_ _Contribution Margin_ _"_ shall be the
amount representing the Sellers and the Purchasers estimate of the
contribution margin allocable to each of the Customer Contracts identified
on  _Schedule 2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, as such Contribution
Margin is identified on _Schedule 2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
(b) each such Customer Contract shall be deemed to represent the portion of
the Contribution Margin identified for such Customer Contract on such
schedule, and (c) _"_ _Aggregate Contribution Margin_ _"_ shall mean the sum
of the Contribution Margin allocated to each Customer Contract on  _Schedule
2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

(b) To the extent that the aggregate amounts paid to the Sellers and their
Affiliates under this Agreement and the Other Purchase Agreements on the
Closing Date (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08) is less than
the product of the Global Closing Purchase Price multiplied by the percentage
of Aggregate Contribution Margin represented by Customer Contracts transferred
to the Purchaser at Closing, subject to reduction by One Million Four Hundred
Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,416,667) for each
one percent (1%) by which one hundred percent (100%) exceeds the percentage
of Aggregate Contribution Margin represented by the Customer Contracts
transferred to the 



 

\- 21 -  Purchaser at Closing, the amount payable under this Agreement at Closing
shall be increased by such difference. In the event the Closing Purchase Price
is adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) or Section 6.17, the principal
amount of the Deferred Payment Note will also be adjusted pursuant to its
terms. To the extent that the aggregate amounts paid to the Sellers and their
Affiliates under this Agreement and the Other Purchase Agreements on the
Closing Date (prior to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08) is more than
the product of the Global Closing Purchase Price multiplied by the percentage
of Aggregate Contribution Margin represented by Customer Contracts
transferred to the Purchaser at Closing, subject to reduction by One Million
Four Hundred Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,416,667) for
each one percent (1%) by which one hundred percent (100%) exceeds
the percentage of Aggregate Contribution Margin represented by the Customer
Contracts transferred to the Purchaser at Closing, the amount payable under
this Agreement at Closing shall be decreased by such difference.

2.08 _Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) On or prior to March 31, 2010, the Sellers shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Purchaser a working capital statement as of February 28, 2010
(the " _Target Working Capital Statement_ "), setting forth the Working
Capital as of February 28, 2010 (the " _Target Working Capital_ "), along with
the combined unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of February 28,
2010, and the combined unaudited statement of income for the two month period
ended February 28, 2010, together with the notes and schedules thereto. Within
90 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Purchaser a working capital statement (the " _Final Working
Capital Statement_ "), setting forth the Final Working Capital. The Target
Working Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital Statement shall each
be prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies, including the use of the same line items and line
item entries, used in the preparation of the Sample Working Capital and the
Sample Working Capital Statement; provided, however that assets newly
acquired and liabilities newly incurred following the date of the Sample
Working Capital Statement which are not appropriately placed in line items and
line item entries previously used by the Sellers, but that constitute
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the Other
Purchase Agreements or are the assets or liabilities of a Person acquired by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to an Other Purchase Agreement
will also be included to the extent consistent with the accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies applied in preparing the
Sample Working Capital Statement.

For the avoidance of doubt, in preparing the Target Working Capital Statement
and the Final Working Capital Statement, (i) the Sellers shall ensure that all
included account balances greater than positive $100,000 or less than
negative $100,000, shall be fully reconciled and such reconciliations will be
made available on request to the Purchaser, and (ii) line items and line item
entries that have been agreed to be excluded or included in the Sample
Working Capital Statement shall continue to be included on or excluded from in
Target Working Capital Statement and Final Working Capital Statement.

(b) Within 30 days following receipt by the Purchaser of the Target Working
Capital Statement and Final Working Capital Statement, the Purchaser shall
deliver written notice to the Sellers of any dispute the Purchaser has with
respect to the preparation or content of 



 

\- 22 -  the Target Working Capital Statement or the Final Working Capital Statement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disputes will be limited to the
determination of the Target Working Capital or the Final Working Capital and
the Purchaser may not dispute the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies used in preparing the Target Working Capital or the
Final Working Capital Statement if they are the same as the accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies referenced in the third
sentence of Section 2.08(a). If the Purchaser does not so notify the Sellers
of a dispute with respect to the Target Working Capital Statement or the
Final Working Capital Statement within such 30-day period, such Target
Working Capital Statement or Final Working Capital Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event of such notification of a
dispute, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If the Purchaser and the Sellers, notwithstanding such
good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within 15 days after the
Purchaser advises the Sellers of its objections, then the Purchaser and the
Sellers jointly shall engage an accounting firm of international standing that
is reasonably acceptable to such parties and has not provided services to
either of such parties or their Affiliates within twelve (12) months prior to
the date of such engagement (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve
such dispute. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than 15
days thereafter, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each prepare and submit
a presentation detailing each partys complete statement of proposed
resolution of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm. As soon as
practicable thereafter, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to choose one of the parties positions, based
solely upon the presentations by the Purchaser and the Sellers, and modify the
Target Working Capital Statement or the Final Working Capital Statement
accordingly. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether any determination of Final Working
Capital or Target Working Capital was done in accordance with the third
sentence of Section 2.08(a) (including the use of the same line items and
general ledger accounts as used in the calculation of Sample Working Capital),
and the Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination,
including any determination as to whether GAAP was followed, to the extent
GAAP is inconsistent with the accounting principles, practices, methodologies
and policies used to prepare the Target Working Capital Statement or the Final
Working Capital Statement. The party whose position is not accepted by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall pay all of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm. All determinations made by the Independent
Accounting Firm, and the Target Working Capital Statement or the Final Working
Capital Statement modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

(c) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.08,
each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other parties and
their respective representatives all information, records, data and working
papers (including the audit findings from the Sellers 2009 audit), in each
case, to the extent related to the Business, and shall permit access to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Target Working Capital Statement and the
Final Working Capital Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

(d) (i) If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.08(b)) is less than the Target Working Capital (as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.08(b)), then the Closing Purchase Price will
be adjusted downward by the amount of such shortfall, and the Sellers shall
pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such shortfall to 



 

\- 23 -  the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by the Purchaser to the Sellers. Any such
payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the
Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08.

(ii) If the Final Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.08(b)) is greater than the Target Working Capital (as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.08(b)), then the Closing Purchase Price will
be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess, and the Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to the Sellers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Sellers to the Purchaser. Any such payment is to
be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Final Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08.

2.09 _Non-Assignment of the Assets_. This Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign or transfer any of the Purchased Assets if an attempted
assignment or transfer thereof is prohibited by Law, or, without the approval,
authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit
by, any third party thereto (or with respect thereto) or any
Governmental Entity (collectively _"Approval"_ ), would constitute a breach
thereof or in any way negatively affect the rights of the Sellers or the
Purchaser, as the assignee or transferee of such Purchased Assets, thereunder
and such Approval is not obtained at or before Closing. If the Closing occurs
and such Approval is not obtained, subject to the provisions set forth in
Sections 6.06(d) and 6.17, the Sellers will cooperate with the Purchaser in
good faith without further consideration (other than as provided in subclause
(b) of this Section) in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Sellers designed to both (a) provide the Purchaser with the benefit of
any such Purchased Asset, and (b) cause the Purchaser to bear all costs and
obligations of or under any such Purchased Assets. Any transfer or assignment
to the Purchaser of any Purchased Asset that shall require Approval as
described above in this Section shall be made subject to such Approval being
obtained.

2.10 _Withholding Rights_.

The Purchaser and the Purchasers agents shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from
any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any
Seller such amounts as the Purchaser or its agent may be required to deduct
and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or pursuant to other
applicable judgments, decrees, injunctions or orders. In addition, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable to or on behalf of any Seller such amounts
(including the full principal amount and all accrued, unpaid interest) as are
owing by any Seller to the Purchaser as of the Closing Date. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Seller in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.11 _Allocation_.



 

\- 24 - The Purchaser shall prepare a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and
all other capitalized costs) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with
section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (and any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law, as appropriate). The
Sellers shall timely and properly prepare and deliver all such documents,
forms and other information as the Purchaser may reasonably request to prepare
its proposed allocation. The Purchaser shall deliver such allocation to the
Sellers within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the
Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to attempt to agree on an allocation of
Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) within thirty (30) days after
the Purchaser delivers its proposed allocation to the Sellers. If the
Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to agree on such allocation with such
30-day period, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall engage the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve any unagreed issues regarding such allocation.
As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than 15 days
thereafter, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each prepare and submit a
presentation detailing each partys complete statement of proposed allocation
to the Independent Accounting Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter, any
unagreed issues reflected in the allocations shall be resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by the Purchaser and the Sellers. All
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the proposed
allocation modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The Purchaser and the Sellers
and their Affiliates shall report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but
not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all
Tax purposes consistent with such allocation as agreed to by the Purchaser and
the Sellers or as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm. Neither the
Purchaser nor the Sellers shall take any Tax position (whether in audits, tax
returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required to do so by applicable law.

cost of which is borne by the Business Employee (or his or her dependent or
beneficiary);

(vii) such plan, to the extent it is subject to the group health plan
requirements of Sections 4980B and 9801 through 9834 of the Code and Sections

claims (relating to a Business Employees exercise of a legal right,
opposition to unlawful conduct, participation in filing a charge, or
cooperation in an investigation into an employment complaint) pending or
threatened before any federal, state, or local agency, authority, judicial
forum, or arbitration body against the Sellers relating to any Business
Employee and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no basis therefor.

activities or conduct so as to create or otherwise contribute to the existence

rise to any investigative, remedial or other obligation under any
Environmental Law, or that could result in any kind of liability to the
Sellers or liability of the Sellers to any third party claiming damage to
Person or property as a result of such physical condition, in each case that
would reasonably be expected to result in a liability in excess of (i)
$500,000 individually, or (ii) taking into account operations, activities or
conduct of the Sellers that could result in liability to the Sellers or

property as a result of such physical condition, in each case that would
reasonably be expected to result in a liability in excess of $50,000,

Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Sellers.

4.13 _Insurance_. The Sellers or their respective Affiliates maintain
policies of fire and casualty, liability and other forms of insurance with
respect to the Business in such amounts, with such deductibles and against
such risks and losses as are, in the judgment of the Sellers, reasonable

Disclosure Schedules, and (d) the services, products and assets set forth on
_Schedule 4.04(b)(iii)_ or _4.04(b)(iv)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
the Purchased Assets constitute all of the assets and properties necessary to

the Sellers currently conduct the Business. The Sellers will convey to the
Purchaser, at the Closing, good and valid title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all Liens, except
for Permitted Liens. 

4.15 _Customers and Suppliers_. _Schedule 4.15(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a list of all of the Customers (the " _Material
Customers_ ") that paid $1,000,000 or more in revenue to the Sellers in 2009
for services of the Business and the suppliers of the Sellers that received at
least $1,000,000 of the combined cost of goods and services utilized by the
Business in 2009 (the " _Material Suppliers_ "). Since the Balance Sheet Date,
except for any changes set forth in _Schedule 4.15(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, there has not been (a) any materially adverse change in
the business relationship of the Sellers with any Material Customer or any
Material Supplier with respect to the Business, or (b) any change in any
material term of the Contracts with any Material Customer or any Material
Supplier with respect to the Business. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.15(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, as of the date of this Agreement,
no Material Customer or Material Supplier has given the Sellers written
notice that such Material Customer or Material Supplier 



 

- 41 \-  intends, with respect to the Business, to cease or substantially decrease
its current purchases of goods and services from or sales to the Seller or to
materially change any terms of the Contracts with such Material Customer or
Material Supplier.

4.16 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Sellers, with respect to the
Business, do not have any material liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to
be reflected on a balance sheet, or any notes thereto, prepared in
accordance with GAAP, other than liabilities or obligations that are: (a)
reflected or reserved against in the Business Balance Sheet or in notes
thereto, if any, or (b) incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice.

4.17 _Financial Statements_.

(a) _Schedule 4.17(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth true and

unaudited statement of income for the one month period ended January 31, 2010
and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, together with the
notes and schedules thereto (together with the Business Balance Sheet, the "
_Business Financial Statements_ "). The Business Financial Statements have
been prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP on a consistent basis throughout the
periods presented (except, (A) in each case, as described in the notes thereto
and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and (B) that the Business
Balance Sheet as of the Balance Sheet Date reflects the Purchased Assets or
Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the Other Purchase Agreements or
the assets or liabilities of a Person acquired by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates pursuant to an Other Purchase Agreement whereas the Business
Balance Sheets of the Business as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflect
the Business as historically reported by the Sellers), and (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the combined financial condition and results
of operations of the Business as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no provision
or reserve included in the Business Balance Sheet is materially inadequate in
light of the circumstances requiring such provision or reservation.

(b) _Schedule 4.17(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth the
combined unaudited working capital statement of the Business (the _"Sample
Working Capital Statement"_ _)_ as of the Balance Sheet Date. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 4.17(b)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Sample
Working Capital Statement was prepared, and the Sample Working Capital set
forth therein was calculated, (i) diligently in good faith, (ii) utilizing
the amounts as of the close of business on the Balance Sheet Date for the
asset and liability line items, and general ledger accounts, from _Schedule
1.01(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules for the Business, and (iii)
assuming that all of such asset and liability line items that constitute
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the Other
Purchase Agreements or are the assets or liabilities of a Person acquired by
the Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to an Other Purchase Agreement will
be transferred to the Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.
During the periods covered by the Business Financial Statements: (i) there
has been no material change in the Sellers accounting policies or procedures
applicable to the Business, (ii) all suppliers have been paid in normal terms
by the Business and no Customer has 



 

- 42 \-  been offered incentives to pay amounts to the Business early other than in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (iii)
Customer debts to the Business have not been sold to third parties to
accelerate cash receipts into the Business.

material arrangements, including, but not limited to, surety, performance and
other bonds, that the Sellers and/or their respective
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Entities_ ") have provided, issued or
entered into or for which the Seller Entities are the primary obligors, in
each such case to support or facilitate business transactions or programs of
the Business. The financing arrangements referred to in the foregoing
sentence are hereinafter referred to as the " _Guarantees_ ". There are no
additional Guarantees of the Sellers related to the Business in an amount in

Guarantees of a Seller related to the Business in an amount in excess of
$50,000, $2,000,000 in the Combined Aggregate, and the Sellers are not

(a) The Service Level Achievement Attainment Reports listed on _Schedule
4.19(a) _of the Seller Disclosure Schedules for the period up to and
including January 31, 2010 include audited service levels reported to the
applicable Material Customer. For the period after January 31, 2010, the
Service Level Achievement Attainment Reports listed on  _Schedule 4.19(a)
_of the Seller Disclosure Schedules reflect the raw data which have yet to be
audited and reported to the Material Customers, respectively. The Service
Level Achievement Penalty Levels set forth in the Service Level Achievement
Attainment Reports listed on _Schedule 4.19(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules accurately reflect in all material respects the numbers utilized in
the Contracts of the Material Customers to decide whether to credit or
book accruals (based on service levels) with respect to invoices provided to
Material Customers.

(b) The client satisfaction indices set forth in _Schedule 4.19(b)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules accurately reflect in all material respects a
tabulation of the survey responses received from the applicable Material
Customer.

(c) The business review presentations set forth in _Schedule 4.19(c)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules accurately reflect in all material respects the
business operational information presented to the applicable Material Customer
as part of the quarterly review process for such applicable Material Customer.

_Schedule 4.19(a)_ through _(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall be
updated by the Sellers prior Closing as close as practicable to the Closing
Date to include the most current available applicable report, indices and/or
presentation.

4.20  _No Other Representations or Warranties_. The Purchaser acknowledges
that (a) none of the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Business or the
Purchased Assets or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Business or the Purchased Assets furnished or 



 

- 43 \-  made available to the Purchaser and its representatives, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Schedules, (b) the
Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates in determining to enter into this Agreement, except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
and (c) none of the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall have or be
subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates resulting
from the distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchasers use of, any such
information, including any information, documents or material made available
to the Purchaser in any "data rooms," management presentations or in any other
form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser
acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, the Purchaser shall acquire the
Purchased Assets without any representation or warranty as to merchantability
or fitness of the Purchased Assets for any particular purpose, in an "as is"
condition and on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

additional three Business Day period), the Sellers shall, and shall cause

Convergys Financial Advisor) to be at least as favorable as the Superior
Proposal.

hours after the occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of any
such Proposal, including of all material developments with respect to any such
Proposal and shall provide the Purchaser with copies of any additional written
documentation delivered to the Sellers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or their or their respective Subsidiaries
Representatives in connection therewith. Following the date of this Agreement,
without limiting any of the foregoing, the Sellers shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) notify the Purchaser orally and in writing if it
determines to begin taking any of the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y)
of Section 6.02(b).

(e) After the date of this Agreement, the Sellers shall promptly inform their
Representatives, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries promptly to
inform their respective Representatives of the obligations under this Section
6.02. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the provisions of this Section 6.02 by the Sellers respective Subsidiaries or
the Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.02 by the Sellers.

6.03  _Confidentiality_. The Purchaser acknowledges that the information
being provided to it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between the Purchaser
and the Sellers effective as of May 29, 2009, as amended (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
acknowledges that its obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with
respect to any and all other information provided to it by the Sellers or
their Representatives concerning the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates shall continue to remain subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement for such period of time as provided in the
Confidentiality Agreement, notwithstanding any termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement that has or would otherwise occur, until such time
as the information is no longer deemed to be Confidential Information, as that
term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided further, however,
that the Sellers acknowledge that the Purchasers obligations of
confidentiality and non-disclosure with respect to any and all such other
information shall cease to apply, after the Closing Date, to such information
to the extent it relates to the Business, other than such information that
relates to the Business because: (i) it will be used in providing the services
to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) it would have
been used in providing a service listed on _Schedule 4.04(b)(iii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules which includes the services offered by Sellers to
be provided under the Transition Services Agreement, or (iii) or it was used
in providing the assets or services set forth on _Schedule 4.04(b)(iv)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules.



 

- 49 \- 6.04 _Access to Information_. The Sellers shall afford to the Purchaser
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Closing, to all the properties, books, Contracts, Tax
Returns and records of the Sellers related to the Business, and, during such
period shall furnish promptly to the Purchaser, at the Purchasers expense,
any information concerning the Business as the Purchaser may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall, in all cases, be
subject to confidentiality obligations that the Sellers have to third parties
with respect to records, documents and information, and provided such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Business. All such
information and documents obtained by Purchaser shall be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Sellers shall have no obligation to
disclose, and the Purchaser shall not disclose, to any representative of the
Purchaser any confidential information relating to the Sellers or the
Business unless such representative shall have agreed in writing to be bound
by the terms the Confidentiality Agreement and such writing shall have been
delivered to the Sellers.

6.05 _Notification of Certain Matters_. To the extent not prohibited by Law or
existing Contracts, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and NISL,
on the other hand, agree to notify each other in writing promptly upon the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that would cause any of the
partys representations or warranties in Articles III, IV and V above to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the Closing Date and any material failure of the party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder. To the extent not prohibited by Law or existing Contracts,
the Sellers also hereby agree to:

(a) provide the Purchaser with any written notice from a Customer alleging a
breach under any Customer Contract with respect to the Business;

(b) provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice of any changes to any
Customer Contract that would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the
Business by an amount exceeding $500,000;

(c) provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice of receipt of any written
notice that a Material Customer intends, with respect to the Business, to
cease or substantially decrease its current purchases of goods and services
from the Sellers or to materially change any terms of the Contracts with such
Material Customer;

(d) as promptly as practicable, provide the Purchaser with copies of any items
listed on _Schedule 4.19(a), (b) or (c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules;

(e) provide the Purchaser with a high-level monthly management report relating

(f) provide the Purchaser with monthly financial statements of the Business
promptly after such statements are completed.



 

- 50 \- 6.06 _Further Assurances; Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) The Purchaser and the Sellers will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties to this Agreement in
doing, all things necessary or desirable under applicable Law to consummate,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(b) The Purchaser and the Sellers will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) prepare, as soon as practicable, all filings and other
presentations in connection with seeking any Required Regulatory Approval,
exemption or other authorization from any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) prosecute
such filings and other presentations with diligence; and (iii) oppose any
objections to, appeals from or petitions to reconsider or reopen any such
approval by Persons not party to this Agreement. The Purchaser and
the Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate
obtaining any final order or orders approving the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or to remove any impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser and the Seller will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to furnish all information in connection with
the approvals of or filings with regard to the Required Regulatory Approvals
with any Governmental Entity and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information in connection with any such requirements imposed upon the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 6.06(c), the Purchaser
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Required Regulatory
Approval, or any exemption thereto, and to remove any impediment imposed by
any Governmental Entity to allow the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability for the failure to obtain any
Required Regulatory Approval in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except to the extent such failure results from a breach by
the Sellers of a representation related to such Required Regulatory Approval.
The Purchaser and the Sellers will each advise the other party promptly of any
material communication received by such party or any of its Affiliates from
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), applicable foreign anti-trust and other
regulatory Governmental Entities, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) such party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC, the DOJ,
applicable foreign anti-trust and other regulatory Governmental Entities, any
state attorney general or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Sellers nor the Purchaser will
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any findings or inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby without giving the other parties prior notice of the
meeting and the opportunity to attend and/or participate, in each case,
unless prohibited by the Governmental Entity. The Sellers and the Purchaser
will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any information
or proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to
the HSR Act or any applicable foreign anti-trust Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.



 

- 51 \- (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions set forth
in Section 6.06(b), each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than: (i) fifteen (15) Business Days
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the FTC and
the DOJ the notification and report form, if any, required for the
transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act; and (ii) thirty (30) days
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with the
applicable Governmental Entities applicable foreign anti-trust notifications
and reports, if any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith. Any such
notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or any applicable
foreign anti-trust Law, as the case may be. Each of the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act or
any applicable foreign anti-trust Law, as the case may be. Each party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance required under
the HSR Act or any applicable foreign anti-trust Law, as the case may be for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Purchaser and NISL shall commit to any and all
divestitures, licenses, or hold separate or similar agreements with respect to
assets or conduct of business arrangements of Purchaser, NISL or the Sellers,
as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals from any Governmental Entity
for any reason in order to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
taking any and all actions relating to the Purchaser or NISL, or the
divestiture of the Sellers, necessary in order to ensure that (i) no
requirement for non-action, a waiver, consent or approval of the FTC, the
DOJ, applicable foreign anti-trust and other regulatory Governmental Entities,
any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity, (ii) no Judgment,
temporary restraining order or any other order of any Governmental Entity in
any Proceeding (whether brought, sought or obtained by a private party or a
Governmental Entity), and (iii) no other matter relating to any antitrust or
competition Law, would preclude consummation of the transactions completed by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable. The Purchaser and NISL represent
and warrant that, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser and NISL, no Affiliate of
the Purchaser or NISL, or any Person controlled by any such Affiliate, in
each case, other than the Purchaser, NISL and their respective Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, owns or controls any Competitive Operation. For the
period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of (i) 180 days
thereafter, (ii) the date that the waiting period under HSR Act has expired
or been terminated, or (iii) termination of this Agreement, neither the
Purchaser nor NISL shall, nor shall they authorize or knowingly permit any
Representative of the Purchaser, NISL or any their respective Subsidiaries
to, (i) solicit, initiate, endorse or take any action to knowingly encourage
or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
proposal or offer involving any Competitive Operation, (ii) enter into,
consummate, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any agreement with
respect to any proposal relating to any Competitive Operation, or (iii)
resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Purchaser and NISL
shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
immediately after the date of this Agreement, cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by the
Purchaser, NISL, any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any of 



 

- 52 \-  their respective Representatives, with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all consents from third parties necessary or
appropriate to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall not be required to pay
or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any
Person from whom any such consent may be required (other than nominal filing
or application fees); provided further, however, that NISL shall be obligated
to guarantee the obligations of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under
any Contract, if required by any counterparty to such Contract as a condition
to granting any consent thereunder; provided, further, that if any Person
requests payment of any amount or requests a change with respect to such
Contract that is a Customer Contract to grant such Persons consent, and if
the Sellers request in writing that the Purchaser pay such amount or make such
change to obtain such consent and the Purchaser does not agree, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such written request, to make such payment or such
change, the Sellers may any time thereafter transfer, sell or assign the
applicable Customer Contract to another Person that is willing to pay the
requested amount or make the requested change to obtain the applicable
consent. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required
from parties to the Contracts listed in the Seller Disclosure Schedules and
that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Except for adjustments
to the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.07, neither the Sellers
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to
the Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents or waivers that may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract
as a result thereof. The Purchaser acknowledges that no representation,
warranty or covenant of the Sellers contained herein shall be breached or
deemed breached solely as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any consent or
waiver identified in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedules or any
other Transaction Document, (ii) any such termination or (iii) any Proceeding
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such termination.

6.07 _Expenses; Tax Matters; Transfer Taxes_.

(a) Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as set forth in this
Section and Article IX, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to
Section 6.06. The Purchaser shall bear the filing fee of the notification and
report form, if any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the HSR Act and any applicable foreign anti-trust Laws.

(b) The Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for all Transfer Taxes
associated with, arising from or otherwise applicable to the transfer and
delivery of the Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, any such
Taxes arising as a result of any deemed or effective transfer of the capital
stock of any Subsidiary as a result of the transactions contemplated herein.

(c) The Sellers shall retain and assume the Retained Tax Liabilities.



 

- 53 \- (d) After the Closing, (i) the Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation of all Tax Returns required with respect to
Taxes relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) beginning on or before the Closing Date, and (ii) the
Sellers will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, in connection with the preparation of any tax provisions in the
Purchasers financial statements relating to Taxes on the Business or the
Purchased Assets. In each case, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall provide or
cause to be provided to one another any records and other information
reasonably requested by the other party hereto in connection with
the preparation of such Tax Returns or financial statements, as well as
reasonable access to the other partys accountant. After the Closing Date, the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate fully in connection with any Tax
investigation, audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Business or the Purchased Assets for any taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning on or before the Closing. Any information obtained pursuant
to this Section 6.07(d) shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(e) All Tax Sharing Agreements or similar agreements with respect to Taxes
relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets (other than Tax Sharing
Agreements for which the Purchaser will have no liability and that relate only
to Retained Tax Liabilities) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and,
after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax related to the
portion of such Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and
Income Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Tax period and (ii) in the case of
any Income Tax and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and
included the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (ii) shall be made in a
manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.

6.08 _Employee Matters_.

(a) _Schedule 6.08(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules provides a list of
all employees of the Sellers (including active employees and employees on
maternity, military, short-term disability, long-term disability, holiday,
jury duty, bereavement or other leave) who perform (or would perform except
for being on such leave) a majority of their duties on behalf of the
Business (" _Business Employees_ ") as of the date identified in such
schedule, and such schedule shall be updated by the Sellers prior to Closing
as close as practical to the Closing Date. A Business Employee who is used to
service or is necessary to fulfill Sellers or Sellers Affiliates
obligations under any Retained Contract with respect to which any required
consent to assign is obtained after the Closing Date and in accordance with
Section 6.17 hereof shall be referred to herein as a " _Post-Closing Assigned
Contract Employee_ ".



 

- 54 \- Except as provided below, the Sellers shall terminate the employment of each
Business Employee, effective as of the Closing Date other than a Business
Employee on long-term disability leave on such date. The Sellers shall
terminate the employment of each Post-Closing Assigned Contract Employee,
effective as of the date that the Retained Contract covering such individual
becomes assigned under Section 6.17 hereof other than a Post-Closing Assigned
Contract Employee on long-term disability leave on such date.

(b) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make offers of
employment to all of the Business Employees (other than Business Employees
described in Section 2.02(b) hereof and the Post-Closing Assigned Contract
Employees) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.08(b) on the
Closing, and to the Post-Closing Assigned Contract Employees on the date
that the Retained Contract covering such individual becomes assigned under
Section 6.17 hereof. Such employment offers shall contain terms and
conditions, including compensation and benefits (including severance but
excluding retention bonuses, one-time bonus payments, one-time incentive
payments and implementation bonuses), that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those applicable to such Business Employees immediately prior
to the Closing, and such terms and conditions, including compensation and
benefits (including severance but excluding retention bonuses, one-time bonus
payments, one-time incentive payments and implementation bonuses), shall
continue for at least one (1) year following the Closing for the
employees listed on _Schedule 6.08(b)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be obligated to offer the
Business Employees equity-based compensation benefits so long as the other
compensation and benefits offered to the Business Employees by the Purchaser
are, in the aggregate (taking into account the equity-based compensation
benefits), no less favorable to the Business Employees than those applicable
to them immediately prior to the Closing, and the Purchaser shall have no
obligation to offer defined benefit pension plan benefits or cash balance
pension plan benefits to any Business Employee. Each Business Employee who
accepts the offer of employment from the Purchaser or its Affiliate
is referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ", and the date such
individual commences employment with the Purchaser or its Affiliate is
referred to herein as the " _Transfer Date_ ". To Sellers Knowledge, there
are no restrictions that would prohibit the employment of any Business
Employee by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser immediately following the
Closing. The Purchaser and its Affiliates agree not to terminate any of
the Transferred Employees who are identified on _Schedule 6.08(b)(i)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules during the one (1) year period commencing on the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , the Purchaser and its Affiliates
may terminate the employment of such individuals (i) for cause, which shall
include (without limitation) poor performance and misconduct, as determined by
Purchaser and its Affiliates; (ii) due to a change of Customer requirements
pertaining to the individual, which shall include (without limitation)
termination of the applicable Customer Contract or a Customer requested
personnel change; or (iii) whose roles or employment terms, prior to the
Closing Date, are under review or in the process of being changed by the
Sellers, or whose Customer Contract terms are changed by the Customer prior to
the Closing Date (or if such individual is a Post-Closing Assigned Contract
Employee, then the date the applicable Assigned Contract is assigned in
accordance with Section 6.17 hereof). Except as set forth in the preceding
sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the Purchaser or its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee or
otherwise alter the otherwise "at-will" status of any such Transferred
Employee.



 

- 55 \- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph, a
Business Employee (other than a Business Employee described in Section
2.02(b) hereof) who is on long-term disability leave of absence from
employment with the Sellers on the Closing Date (or, if applicable, the date a
Retained Contract for which a Post-Closing Assigned Contract Employee renders
services is assigned pursuant to Section 6.17 hereof) (an " _Inactive Business
Employee_ ") shall remain an employee of the Sellers. Upon an Inactive
Business Employees return to active employment, the Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliate to, make an offer of employment to such Inactive
Business Employee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.08(b).
If the Inactive Business Employee accepts the offer, Sellers shall promptly
terminate the employment of, and Purchaser or its Affiliate shall immediately
thereafter hire, such individual (which date of hire is referred to as the "
_Inactive Business Employee Transfer Date_ "). During the period beginning on
the Closing Date (or the applicable Retained Contract assignment date) and
ending on the earlier of (i) the Inactive Business Employee Transfer Date or
(ii) the date the Inactive Business Employee is no longer entitled to receive
benefits under the Sellers long-term disability plans, the Purchaser shall be
responsible for all costs and liabilities relating to the Inactive Business
Employees long-term disability benefits under the Sellers long-term
disability plans consistent with the costs and liabilities set forth on
_Schedule 6.08(b)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (" _Inactive
Business Employee Disability Expenses_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, these
costs and liabilities shall not include the benefits provided by the insurer
pursuant to the Sellers fully-insured long-term disability plan. The Sellers
shall provide on a quarterly basis or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties
a written invoice of the Inactive Business Employee Disability Expenses to the
Purchaser, and payment of such invoice will be due within thirty (30) days of
receipt by the Purchaser.

 

(c) The Sellers and the Purchaser intend that for purposes of any severance or
termination benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of
Sellers or the Sellers Affiliates, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a severance of employment of any Business
Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement, and that the Transferred Employees will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before, during and immediately
following the Transfer Date. The Sellers shall amend the plans set forth in
_Schedule 6.08(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to indicate that a
transfer of employment described by this Section 6.08(c) shall not constitute
a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code
with respect to any Transferred Employee under such plans. The Sellers shall
reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser (i) to facilitate communications with
the Business Employees in connection with Purchasers or its Affiliates
offers of employment and transitioning issues, and (ii) to enable the
Purchaser to attempt to minimize the Purchasers severance liability with
respect to the Business Employees; provided, however, that the Sellers shall
have no obligation to modify any Employee Plan with respect to severance or
otherwise. The Sellers shall be responsible for satisfying any obligations
under COBRA with respect to any Business Employees who refuse to accept the
Purchasers or its Affiliates offer of employment. Except for the
liabilities described in Section 2.04(b) hereof, the Purchaser shall assume
all obligations and liabilities arising out or relating to employment,
compensation, employee benefits, severance or termination of any
individual employed by the Sellers with respect to the Business who
voluntarily terminates employment as a result of direct communication or
receipt of a direct message from or on behalf of the Purchaser relating to the
employment, position or terms or conditions of employment of such individual
with the Purchaser or its Affiliates post-Closing; provided, however, town
hall 



 

- 56 \-  meetings with, QandA sessions with, QandA communications to, and communications
targeted to (i) a significant percentage of the Business Employee population,
whether or not delivered at the same time, or (ii) a majority of the Business
Employees who are "C" level or above, as designated by the Sellers, taken as a
whole, shall not be considered such a direct communication or direct message.

(d) After the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take all
necessary action so that each Transferred Employee shall after the applicable
Transfer Date continue to be credited with the unused vacation and unused sick
leave credited to such employee through the Transfer Date under the applicable
vacation and sick leave policies of the Sellers and their Affiliates, and
the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall permit or cause such employees to use
such vacation and sick leave after the Transfer Date in accordance with such
policies. The Sellers will provide to the Purchaser correct and complete
records of all such vacation and sick leave.

(e) The Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall, as of the Closing, assume
sponsorship and administration of all of the Assumed Employee Plans as set
out in _Schedule 4.07(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to
the obligations thereunder related to the Transferred Employees as of the
Transfer Date and the Business Employees who reject the Purchasers or its
Affiliates offer of employment as of the Closing Date.

(f) The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, as of and after the Closing, take
all other necessary action so that, for all purposes under each Employee Plan
maintained by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred
Employees become eligible to participate, each such person shall be given
credit for all service (including service used to determine eligibility for,
vesting in, and benefit accruals under such plan, except benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan of the Purchaser or its Affiliates),
prior to the Transfer Date with the Sellers and their Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such service will be credited to
the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits.

(g) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.08, nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power, after the Closing, of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend or terminate any particular
Assumed Employee Plan or as requiring such companies to continue (other than
as required by its terms) any written employment contract; provided, however,
that no such termination or amendment may impair the rights of any person
with respect to benefits that have been accrued as of the date of the
termination or amendment under the terms of any such plan that is an employee
pension benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA), benefits
for which a claim has already been incurred as of the date of the termination
or amendment under the terms of any employee welfare benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), or any benefits earned as of the date of
the termination or amendment under the terms of any such plan that is not such
an employee pension benefit plan or employee welfare benefit plan, to the
extent any such action would violate applicable Law. 

(h) Upon and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Transferred Employees under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which
such persons may be eligible to participate after the applicable Transfer
Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are in effect with
respect 



 

- 57 \-  to such persons and that have not been satisfied under the corresponding
welfare or fringe benefit Employee Plans maintained by the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates prior to such Transfer Date, and (ii) provide each
Transferred Employee with credit under any welfare plans in which such person
becomes eligible to participate after the Transferred Employees Transfer Date
for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such person for the then current
plan year under the corresponding welfare plans maintained by the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates prior to such Transfer Date. The Sellers will
ensure the Purchasers receive correct and sufficient information as to such
participation rights, co-payments and deductibles applicable to the
Transferred Employees.

(i) For the 91-day (inclusive) period immediately following the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause any successor or permitted assign of
any portion of the Business not to, cause or permit to be implemented any
plant closing, mass layoff or other termination of Transferred Employees
which, either alone or in the aggregate (with each other and/or with any plant
closing, partial closing, mass layoff or other termination of Transferred
Employees occurring on or prior to the Closing Date), could create any
liability for the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers under the WARN Act
or similar applicable Law. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the
Purchaser and its Affiliates will not be deemed to breach the preceding
sentence if the Purchaser or its Affiliate take any of the actions set forth
in _Schedule 6.08(i)_.

(j) Except as set forth in  _Schedule 6.08(j)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules, with respect to each Retained Employee Plan:

(i) The sponsorship of such plan shall be retained by the Sellers or one of
their Affiliates and specifically shall not be assumed by the Purchaser, and
the Purchaser shall not be responsible for any of the benefits or other
liabilities of such plan; 

(ii) No Transferred Employees shall accrue or earn any benefits under such
plan for their services for the Business or with the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after their applicable Transfer Date; and

(iii) Except to the extent required by applicable Law, no post-retirement
benefit shall be provided under such plan to any Transferred Employees unless
they retire from employment (when entitled to retiree benefits under such
plan) prior to their applicable Transfer Date.

(k) The Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall retain all liabilities
for all dental, vision, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment
claims and fully-insured medical and prescription drug claims, incurred by the
Business Employees or their eligible dependents (including their eligible
domestic partners and their eligible dependents) prior to such employees
Transfer Date, that are covered under the terms of the applicable fully-
insured plans of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates and all workers
compensation claims that are fully-insured under the terms of the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates workers compensation program; provided, however,
the Purchaser shall reimburse the Sellers for all expenses, costs and
liabilities incurred by the Sellers in connection with such claims. For the
avoidance of doubt, 



 

- 58 \-  this reimbursement shall not include the benefits provided by the insurer
pursuant to the fully-insured plan. The Purchaser, or its Affiliates, shall be
responsible for claims incurred by the Transferred Employees or their
eligible dependents (including their eligible domestic partners and their
eligible dependents) on or after the Transfer Date for fully-insured medical
and prescription drug claims, dental, vision, life insurance, accidental
death and dismemberment claims. For these purposes, a claim shall be deemed to
be incurred: (i) in the case of workers compensation, at the time of the
injury, sickness or other event giving rise to the claim for such
benefits; (ii) in the case of medical, prescription drug, dental or vision
benefits, at the time professional services, equipment or prescription drugs
covered by the applicable plan are obtained; (iii) in the case of life
insurance benefits, upon death; and (iv) in the case of accidental death and
dismemberment benefits, at the time of the accident.

(l) The Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall retain all liabilities
for all medical and workers compensation claims, whenever such claims are
submitted, that are incurred by the Business Employees or their eligible
dependents (including their eligible domestic partners and their eligible
dependents) from the date that is 60 days or 90 days, for medical and workers
compensation claims, respectively, prior to such employees Transfer Date
through the day prior to such employees Transfer Date, that are covered
under the terms of the applicable self-insured plans, including without
limitation the Employee Plans, of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates.
The Purchaser, or its Affiliates, shall be responsible for reimbursing the
Sellers for the payment of self-insured medical and self-insured workers
compensation claims covered under such plans that are submitted after the
Transfer Date but are incurred by the Transferred Employees or their eligible
dependents (including their eligible domestic partners and their eligible
dependents) (i) during the period that begins on the date hereof and ends on
the date that is 61 days or 91 days, for medical and workers compensation
claims, respectively, prior to such employees Transfer Date; provided,
however, that in the case of a Post-Closing Assigned Contract Employee, this
period shall begin on the later of the date hereof or 90 days or 120 days,
for medical and workers compensation claims, respectively, prior to the
applicable Transfer Date, and (ii) on or after the Transfer Date. For these
purposes, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred at the time professional
services or equipment covered by the applicable plan are obtained. The
Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser on a monthly basis, or as otherwise
agreed upon by the Sellers and the Purchaser, a written invoice of the medical
and workers compensation claim payments that are reimbursable pursuant to
this Section 6.08(l) and documentation reasonably sufficient to substantiate
such payments. The Purchaser shall pay such invoice within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such invoice and documentation.

(m) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the originals of all records
set forth in the Transferred Employees personnel files (the " _Personnel
Records_ ") that are created prior to the applicable Transfer Date shall be
transferred to Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates as of such Transfer Date
(with the Sellers retaining copies of all such records, at Sellers option).
The originals of all personnel records of all former employees of the Business
and all Business Employees who are not Transferred Employees shall remain with
Sellers and their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that Purchaser shall be
provided with a copy of all employee health and safety records required by
applicable Law, and Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall permit
Purchaser or its Affiliates or successors and their authorized
representatives to have full access upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours to all such personnel records to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and reasonably necessary in order for Purchaser or any
of its 



 

- 59 \-  Affiliates or successors to respond to a subpoena, court order, audit,
investigation or otherwise as required by applicable Law or in connection with
any pending or threatened lawsuits, actions, arbitrations, claims,
complaints, investigations or other Proceedings. The Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall permit Sellers and their authorized representatives to have
full access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to all
the Personnel Records in order for Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates to respond to a subpoena, court order, audit, investigation, or to
obtain data for pension or other benefits, or otherwise as required by
applicable Law (such determination by the parties of access shall be
reasonable and shall not be unreasonably delayed), and Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall provide Sellers, upon Sellers reasonable request and at
Sellers expense, with copies of such Personnel Records. 

(n) Following the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates, to cooperate reasonably fully with the Purchaser and its
Affiliates in the prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of any Assumed
Liabilities of the Purchaser and its Affiliates with respect to any Business
Employee under this Agreement. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably fully with the
Sellers and their Affiliates in the prosecution, defense, and/or settlement of
any Retained Liabilities of the Sellers and their Affiliates with respect to
any Business Employee under this Agreement. Any such cooperation set forth in
this Section 6.08(n) shall include (i) affording the Purchaser or the Sellers,
as applicable, and their respective Affiliates, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable written notice during
normal business hours, to all relevant personnel, properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records; (ii) furnishing promptly to the Purchaser
or the Sellers, as applicable, and their respective Affiliates, counsel and
other representatives any information reasonably requested by it, such
Affiliates, such counsel or such other representatives; and (iii) providing
any other assistance to the Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable,
and their respective Affiliates, counsel and other representatives reasonably
requested by such other party, such Affiliates, such counsel or such other
representatives.

(o) Nothing in this Section 6.08 is intended or shall be intended to entitle
any person other than the parties hereto and their respective transferees and
permitted assigns to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind.
Nothing in this Section 6.08 shall be deemed to amend any Employee Plan of the
Sellers or the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

6.09 _Publicity_. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations
of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers and the Purchaser may
make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent
with the parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby after reasonable prior notice to and consultation with
the other party.

6.10 _Names Following Closing_.



 

- 60 \- (a) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have the
right to use, the "Convergys" name or any variations or derivatives thereof
or any trademarks or logos of the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates (the _"Names"_ ), or any name that, in the reasonable judgment of
the Sellers, is similar to the Names, except as provided in this Section
6.10.

(b) After the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have the right
to use existing packaging, labeling, containers, stationery, business forms,
supplies, advertising and promotional materials and any similar materials
bearing the Names until the three-month anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
take any action that could reasonably be expected to impair the value of the
Names; provided further, however, that when using the items listed in
this Section 6.10(b) in the context of entering into or conducting
contractual relationships, the Purchaser shall make clear to all other
applicable parties that the Purchaser, rather than the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates, is the party entering into or conducting the
contractual relationship; _provided further_ , _however_ , that personnel of
the Purchaser or its Affiliates using the above items shall not, and shall
have no authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of
the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers. The Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall comply with all applicable Laws in any use of packaging or labeling
containing the Names.

(c) The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize its
use of the Names, and, in any event, shall cease using the Names on fixed

indirectly, acting alone, as a member of any partnership or other business

business entity (except as the holder of less than 1% of the issued and
outstanding stock of a publicly held corporation) during the three (3) year
period commencing with the Closing Date, solicit for employment any
Transferred Employee; _provided_ , _that_ , this covenant shall not apply to
individuals whose employment is terminated by the Purchaser, or any Affiliate
thereof, without cause following the Closing; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall prohibit the Sellers or their Affiliates from soliciting for
employment, any person who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement
by the Sellers or their Affiliates that is not directed to solicit the
Purchaser or its employees. If any covenant or agreement in this Section
6.11 is held to be unenforceable because of the duration thereof or the scope
thereof, then the court making such determination shall have the power to
reduce the duration and/or limit the scope thereof to the minimum extent
necessary to make the covenant or agreement enforceable in its reduced form;
provided, however, that such reduction shall only apply to the applicable
jurisdiction of such court, unless such limitation would render such
limitation unenforceable.

6.12 _Non-Competition Agreement_. During the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the third anniversary thereof, the Sellers shall not, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly engage, as a
principal or jointly with others, in the Business as conducted as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that neither the Sellers nor any Subsidiary shall
be prevented from:

(based on the most recent full fiscal year revenues of such Person) and are
not more than $50,000,000 when combined with the total annual revenues for
such period from Competitive Operations of any other Person(s) previously
acquired (and still owned) by the Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries,
provided that this covenant shall not be violated as a result of any such
acquisition if (i) such Competitive Operations do not account for more than
30% of such Persons total annual revenues, (ii) the Sellers cause the total
annual revenues (based on the most recent full fiscal year revenues of such
Person) derived from all Competitive Operations acquired after the Closing
Date to decrease below $25,000,000, either by permitting Contracts relating to
such Competitive Operations to expire within 12 months following the
acquisition thereof, or to the extent such Contracts will not by their terms
expire within such 12 months, divesting themselves of such Competitive
Operations in excess of $25,000,000 within 12 months following the acquisition
thereof; (iii) the Sellers do not renew or enter into any new Contracts
relating to the Competitive Operations acquired after the Closing Date
between the date of such acquisition and the third anniversary of the Closing

filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) as a separate business,
including but not limited to: 

(i) Healthcare-related outsourcing services ( _"Healthcare Services"_ ) to any
third party provided such provision of services is not to such third partys
employees; notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and their Affiliates may
provide Healthcare Services directly or indirectly, as principal or jointly
with others, to the employees of any Healthcare Group(s) (defined below)
provided such employees are being serviced by the Sellers and/or their
Affiliates in a general inquiry setting along with customers or members of the

limited to, providing any of the services listed on _Schedule 6.12(d)_ of the

management companies,

If any covenant or agreement in this Section 6.12 is held to be unenforceable
because of the duration thereof or the scope thereof, then the court making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration and/or limit
the scope thereof to the minimum extent necessary to make the covenant or
agreement enforceable in its reduced form; provided, however, that such
reduction shall only apply to the applicable jurisdiction of such court,
unless such limitation would render such limitation unenforceable.

6.13 _Financial Obligations_. The Sellers shall, or shall cause one or more of
their Affiliates to, maintain and/or renew each of the Customer Bonds (or an
alternative form of security that is permitted by the terms of the Customer
Contract to which the applicable Customer Bond relates or is otherwise
acceptable to the Customer that is party to such Customer Contract) for
the lesser of (a) the time period from the Closing to the termination or the
expiration date of the Customer Contract to which such Customer Bond relates
as set forth in _Schedule 6.13_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, which
such termination or expiration date shall be extended to the extent the
applicable Customer Contract is extended between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, or (b) the time period from the Closing to the earliest
date on which the Customer Contract to which such Customer Bond relates, as
such Customer Contract exists as of the Closing, provides that such Customer
Bond is no longer required (the _"Bond Maintenance Period"_ ). The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that, after the expiration of the Bond Maintenance
Period with respect to each Customer Bond or alternative form of security
issued in replacement thereof, the Purchaser shall take such actions, if any,
as are necessary to enable the applicable Customer Bond or alternative form
of security issued in replacement thereof to be released. The Purchaser shall
reimburse the Sellers and their Affiliates for all costs, fees and expenses
allocable to the procurement and maintenance of each Customer Bond or
alternative form of security issued in replacement thereof after the Closing.
The Purchaser agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
obtain, at or before the Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, replacement guarantees for, and (ii) other than with respect to
the Customer Bonds, have the Seller Entities completely and irrevocably
released from 



 

- 63 \-  any and all liability for, any and all arrangements, including surety,
performance and other bonds and guarantees, that the Seller Entities have
provided, issued or entered into or for which the Seller Entities are the
primary obligors, in each case, to support or facilitate business transactions
or programs of the Business (the _"Credit Enhancements"_ ) that are in effect
at the Closing, including by having the Purchaser and NISL substituted as
replacement guarantors on such Credit Enhancements. The Purchaser and NISL
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Entities from and against
any and all losses, costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Seller
Entities relating to the Credit Enhancements related to any Purchased Asset
and shall reimburse the Sellers for any such amounts promptly and in no event
later than five (5) Business Days after written demand therefor from
the Sellers. All Affiliates of Seller which have liability for any Credit
Enhancements referenced in this Section 6.13 are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.13 and shall have the right to enforce the
benefits intended to be conferred upon each of them under this Section 6.13
as though they were parties to this Agreement.

6.14  _Insurance_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that no insurance
policy maintained by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates with respect
to the Purchased Assets or the Business shall cover any of the Purchased
Assets or the operations or liabilities of the Business after the Closing
Date, and all benefits and coverage under each such insurance policy shall
terminate following the Closing Date. Following the Closing and until the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its Affiliates
agree to obtain and maintain insurance policies with respect to the Purchased
Assets and the Business with insurance companies substantially similar to the
Sellers insurance companies and with coverages as described on _Schedule
6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules. The parties hereto further agree
that any and all refunds of premiums paid by the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date under any insurance maintained by the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates for the Business shall be for the
account of and retained by the Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, during the
twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall make a
claim, on behalf of and for the benefit of the Purchaser, under their
insurance policies (other than errors and omissions policies and directors and
officers liability policies) for claims made on a claims-arising basis and
shall promptly and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
receipt of any proceeds from such claims tender such proceeds to the
Purchaser, to the extent that: (i) such claims-arising basis existed prior to
the Closing, (ii) the Purchasers insurance tail coverage required under
Section 6.16 does not cover such claim, (iii) the Purchaser pays and/or
reimburses the Sellers within five (5) Business Days for any and all
reasonable costs of the Sellers relating to or arising out of the making of
such claim, including all deductibles paid by the Sellers in connection with
making such claims, and (iv) such claim relates to an Assumed Liability.

6.15 _Real Property_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that none of
the Real Property is being sold, conveyed, assigned or otherwise transferred
to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, except as provided for in the
agreements to be executed and delivered by such parties pursuant to Section
2.07. If, prior to the Closing, (i) any Leased Real Property, or any material
Fixed Assets are damaged in any material respect by fire or any other cause,
or (ii) any condemnation proceedings are instituted, or notice of intent to
condemn is given, with respect any Leased Real Property or material
Fixed Assets, the Sellers shall give the 



 

- 64 \-  Purchaser written notice thereof within five (5) Business Days after the
Sellers become aware thereof.

6.16 _Tail Coverage_. The Purchaser shall purchase, at or prior to the
Closing, errors and omissions insurance tail coverage covering any and all
occurrences prior to the Closing with respect to the Business. Such coverage
shall be in a minimum amount of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00),
with a maximum deductible of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), and shall
be written by one or more insurance companies having an A.M. Best
or comparable rating at least equal to that of the insurance company that has
written the Sellers errors and omissions insurance overage as of the date of
this Agreement.

6.17 _Post-Closing Consents_.

(a) To the extent any consent required for the Purchasers assumption of any
Retained Contract is received by the Sellers between the period from the
Closing Date and that date that is six (6) months from the date of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall sell, and the Purchaser shall purchase, such
Retained Contract within a period of ten (10) Business Days following the date
of notification and delivery by the Sellers of receipt of the requisite
affirmative written consent for such Retained Contract (or within such time as
may be agreed between the Sellers and the Purchaser) at a price in cash equal
to One Million Four Hundred Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars
($1,416,667) for each one percent (1%) of the Aggregate Contribution Margin
represented by the Contribution Margin identified for such Retained Contract
on _Schedule 2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

To the extent that the aggregate amounts paid in cash to the Sellers and their
Affiliates under this Agreement and the Other Purchase Agreements on any and
all dates between the period from the Closing Date and that date that is six
(6) months from the date of this Agreement in connection with obtaining the
consent required for the Purchasers assumption of any Retained Contract is
less than an amount that is equal to One Million Four Hundred Sixteen
Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,416,667) for each one percent
(1%) of the Contribution Margin identified for such Retained Contract on
_Schedule 2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the amount payable under
this Agreement in connection with purchasing such Retained Contract shall be
increased by such difference. To the extent that the aggregate amounts paid in
cash to the Sellers and their Affiliates under this Agreement and the Other
Purchase Agreements on any and all dates between the period from the Closing
Date and that date that is six (6) months from the date of this Agreement in
connection with obtaining the consent required for the Purchasers assumption
of any Retained Contract is more than an amount that is equal to One Million
Four Hundred Sixteen Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Dollars ($1,416,667) for
each one percent (1%) of the Contribution Margin identified for such Retained
Contract on _Schedule 2.07_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the amount
payable under this Agreement in connection with purchasing such Retained
Contract shall be decreased by such difference.

 

(b) To the extent any consent required for the Purchasers assumption of any
Retained Contract is received by the Sellers between the period from the date
that is six (6) months from the date hereof and the date that is twelve (12)
months from the Closing Date, the Sellers shall sell, and the Purchaser shall
purchase, such Retained Contract within a period of ten (10) Business Days
following the date of notification and delivery by the Sellers of receipt of
the 



 

- 65 \-  requisite affirmative written consent for such Retained Contract (or within
such time as may be agreed between the Sellers and the Purchaser) at a price
to be agreed to in good faith between the parties (the _"Fair Value Price"_
). To the extent the parties cannot agree on the Fair Value Price, such Fair
Value Price shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth on
_Schedule 6.17(b)_. Notwithstanding the above, the aggregate amount paid to
the Sellers for all such Retained Contracts that are transferred pursuant to
this Section shall not exceed the aggregate reduction to the Closing Purchase
Price at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.07.

(c) Upon the Purchasers acquisition of any Retained Contract pursuant to this
Section 6.17, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have automatically (i)
acquired any and all assets that would have constituted Purchased Assets if
such Retained Contract had been transferred to the Purchaser at the Closing,
and (ii) assumed any and all liabilities that would have constituted Assumed
Liabilities if such Retained Contract had been transferred to the Purchaser at
the Closing, in each case, without further action required by the Purchaser or
the Sellers; provided, however, that for purposes of the indemnification
provision set forth in Article IX, the representations and warranties of the
Sellers in this Agreement related to such Purchased Assets (including the
Retained Contracts and the Post-Closing Assigned Contract Employees) and
Assumed Liabilities shall be deemed to have been remade at the time of such
transfer and shall be true and correct at and as of the time of such transfer;
provided, further, that such parties shall cooperate to take such actions
and execute such documents as are reasonably requested to give effect to this
Section 6.17(c). In the event the purchase price is adjusted pursuant to this
Section 6.17, the principal amount of the Deferred Payment Note will also
be adjusted pursuant to its terms.

6.18 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Immediately upon the Closing, all
intercompany balances, and, except for the Transaction Documents to be
entered into in connection with this Agreement, all Contracts and other
arrangements between the Sellers and any of their Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Business, on the other hand, shall automatically terminate and cease
to have any further force and effect, such that no party thereto shall have
any further obligations therefor or thereunder.

6.19 _Enterprise Licenses_. During the period that is no more than one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to, and no less than ninety (90) days prior to, the
expiration of the Sellers obligation to use enterprise software licenses to
provide transition services under the Transition Services Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have the right to provide a list of enterprise software
licenses to Sellers that Purchaser would like the Sellers to review to
determine if the Sellers have the right to grant the Purchaser the right to
use at the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement. If, and only if,
providing a right to use any such license in connection with the
Business (including any assignments of individual user licenses) creates no
out-of-pocket cost to the Sellers and is permitted under the Contracts
governing the Sellers rights to use such enterprise software licenses Sellers
shall grant such rights to use the applicable licenses.

6.20 _Cost-Sharing_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree to share the
costs set forth on _Schedule 6.20_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
pursuant to the allocation set forth therein.



 

- 66 \- 6.21 _Russian Transaction_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (a)
at the Closing, they shall cause the parties to the documents attached hereto
as _Schedule 6.21_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules to execute such
documents in substantially the form as attached or such other form as may be
necessary to comply with local law requirements, and (b) between the date
hereof and the Closing, they shall cooperate, in good faith, to finalize such
documents.

6.22 _Other Purchase Agreements_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that, no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
they shall cause the parties to the documents listed in _Schedule 6.22_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules to execute such documents in substantially the
form as attached to _Schedule 6.22_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

6.23 _Reciprocal Agreement_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in
the event any Retained Contracts and Retained Contract Collateral Assets
exist following the Closing, it is in the mutual best interests of the Sellers
and the Purchaser to collaboratively work together to agree upon a reasonable
and appropriate definitive written agreement that addresses the provision and
receipt of services by one party to or from the other, as necessary to service
the Retained Contracts or the Customer Contracts assigned to the Purchaser, as
applicable, (the "Reciprocal Agreement"). The parties hereto
further acknowledge and agree that (a) they intend for the Customer Contracts
assigned to the Purchaser and the Retained Contracts to continue to be
serviced after the Closing in the same manner as they were serviced
immediately prior to the Closing and that the people, systems and other
assets utilized to service such contracts be able to continue to be used in
the same manner after Closing as immediately before Closing as seamlessly as
possible to avoid any disruption in client service, and (b) the Reciprocal
Agreement shall be drafted to reflect such intent. The Reciprocal Agreement
shall contain substantially similar terms as the Transition Services Agreement
with respect to duration, price, payment terms, liability, indemnification
and general provisions and other terms, such as description of services and
service metrics as are reasonably appropriate under the circumstances, taking
into account that each party will likely be both a provider and recipient
of services and each needs to meet its respective customer contractual
obligations. The Reciprocal Agreement will be negotiated by the Sellers and
the Purchaser in good faith between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
and shall be executed by the appropriate parties at the Closing; provided,
however, that the execution of the Reciprocal Agreement shall not be a
condition to the Purchasers or the Sellers obligation to consummate the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that,
within fourteen (14) days following the date of this Agreement, they shall
begin exchanging drafts of the Reciprocal Agreement and shall make their
respective business, financial, technology and legal personnel (including
outside legal and accounting personnel) available, as necessary, to negotiate
and finalize the Reciprocal Agreement on an expedited basis.

following conditions:

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of

Closing (without regard to any qualifications therein as to materiality or
Business Material Adverse Effect), as though made at and as of such time (or,
if made as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except for such
failures to be true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to have,

Purchaser shall have received a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
each of the Sellers to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Sellers_. The Sellers shall have
performed or complied in all material respects with all obligations and
covenants required by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be
performed or complied with by the Sellers by the time of the Closing, and the

- 68 \-  parties hereto acknowledge that the failure to execute the Reciprocal
Agreement shall not constitute a failure to comply with this Section 7.02(b).

(c) _No Termination of Certain Contracts_. None of the Contracts listed on
_Schedule 7.02(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules shall have been
terminated.

7.03 _Conditions to Obligation of the Sellers_. The obligation of the Sellers

Purchaser Material Adverse Effect), as though made at and as of such time (or,
if made as of a specific date, at and as of such date), except for such
failures to be true and correct as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. The
Sellers shall have received a certificate signed by an authorized officer of
the Purchaser to such effect.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser shall have

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

8.01 _Termination_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement
may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(i) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Purchaser; 



 

- 69 \- (ii) by the Sellers if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or 7.03
shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by
the Sellers;

(iii) by the Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or
7.02 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been
waived by the Purchaser;

(iv) by the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser on the other hand, if
all conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 7.03
have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to 90 days after signing;
provided, however, that the Sellers may extend such period for up to an
additional 90 days if all such conditions precedent to Closing have been
satisfied or waived, except for the condition precedent to Closing set forth
in Section 7.01(a); or

(v) by the Sellers, if the Board of Directors of Convergys authorizes the
Sellers, in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including
Section 6.02, to enter into a definitive agreement in respect of a Superior
Proposal or a Total Company Sale.

_provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause
(ii), (iii) or (iv) is not then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that in the event the Sellers terminate pursuant to
clause (v), prior to, or concurrently with, such termination, the Sellers
shall pay to the Purchaser a break-up fee in cash in immediately available
funds in the amount of five percent (5%) of the Global Purchase Price prior to
any possible adjustments as provided in Sections 2.07 and 2.08 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.01 are an integral part of the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, none of the parties
hereto would enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather
a reasonable amount that will compensate the Purchaser for the costs,
expenses, efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes
payable and is paid by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.01, the right to
receive the Termination Fee shall constitute the Purchasers sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement.

(c) In the event of termination by the Sellers or the Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 8.01, written notice thereof shall immediately be given to the
other and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated,
without further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein:



 

- 70 \- (i) the Purchaser shall promptly return all documents and other material
received from the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to the Sellers; and

(ii) all confidential information received by the Purchaser with respect to
the business of the Sellers shall be treated in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in Section 8.01,
this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and
effect, except for the provisions of (i) Section 6.03 relating to the
obligation of the Purchaser to keep confidential certain information and data
obtained by it, (ii) Section 6.07 relating to certain expenses, (iii) Section
8.01 and this Section 8.02, (iv) Section 6.09 relating to publicity, (v)
Article IX, (vi) Article X, and (vii) all other indemnity provisions in this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed to release any party
from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel specific
performance by any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

representation or warranty contained in this Agreement may be brought any
time prior to or on June 30, 2011; provided, further, that any representations
or warranties related to a Retained Contract and related Retained Contract

is twelve (12) months after the effective date of the assignment of such

Purchase Agreements, including the parties obligations under Section 6.13 of
this Agreement with respect to Customer Bonds and Credit Enhancements, shall

- 71 \- 9.02 _Other Indemnification by the Sellers_.

(a)(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.02(a)(ii), 9.02(b)
and 9.02(c), from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify and save and hold harmless the Purchaser, NISL and
their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
attorneys, agents and representatives (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any Covered Losses suffered by
any such Purchaser Indemnitees resulting from or arising out of: (A) any
misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Sellers referenced in Section 9.01(a); (B) any nonfulfillment or breach of
any covenant or agreement made by the Sellers in the Purchase Agreements that
survives the Closing Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b), (C) any Excluded
Assets, (D) any Retained Liabilities, and (E) all penalties and reasonable
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) arising out of or related to any indemnification
made under this Section 9.02. 

(ii) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02 after the expiration of the
applicable survival period referenced in Section 9.01; provided, however, that
if, on or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice
of claim shall have been given to the Sellers in accordance with Section 9.04
for such indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved
as provided in this Article IX, subject to the other limitations set forth in
Sections 9.02(b) and 9.02(d); and provided, further, that the representations
contained in Sections 3.01, 3.02 and 3.03 hereof and the right of the
Purchaser to seek indemnification with respect thereto shall survive
indefinitely, and the representations contained in Sections 4.05, 4.11 and
4.12 hereto and the right of the Purchaser to seek indemnification with
respect thereto shall survive until the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to the matters described therein (including extensions
thereof).

(b) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
9.02 shall be effected by reducing the amount owing under the Deferred Payment
Note if the amount owing under the Deferred Payment Note is zero, only then
may a Purchaser Indemnitee recover for a indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9.02 by a wire transfer or transfers of immediately available funds
from the Sellers to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitee to the Sellers within fifteen (15) days after
the final determination thereof.

(c) The Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02(a) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder, unless such Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate
$500,000, in which case the Sellers shall be liable for all such Covered
Losses in excess of such threshold amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Sellers have any liability or indemnification obligation for
Covered Losses for claims made pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)(A), other than
claims for fraud, willful misconduct, willful misrepresentations, or claims
arising out of or relating to the Retained Liabilities, in excess of twenty
percent (20%) of the sum of (i) the Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted
by Sections 2.07, 2.08 and/or 6.17), and (ii) the principal payments paid or
owed to the Sellers under the Deferred Payment Note (the _"Cap"_ ) in the
aggregate; provided, however, that the Cap shall be reduced for all
Covered Losses paid by the Sellers pursuant to the indemnification 



 

- 72 \-  provisions of the Transition Services Agreement. No indemnified party shall
be entitled to recover from an indemnifying party more than once in respect of
the same Covered Losses.

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement (including
Sections 8.01(a) and 10.06), the Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud, willful misconduct, or willful misrepresentation)
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud, willful misconduct, or willful
misrepresentation) it may have against the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates arising under or based upon this Agreement, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law or otherwise
(except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
IX). Notwithstanding any provision herein, no party shall in any event be
liable to any Person on account of any indemnity obligation set forth in this
Article IX for any indirect, consequential, special, incidental or punitive
damages (including lost profits, diminution in value, loss of use, damage to
goodwill or loss of business), except for the recovery of lost future profits
as a result of an indemnity claim relating to a Covered Loss relating to a
Customer Contract.

9.03 _Other Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.03(b) and 9.03(d),
from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and NISL, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify and save and hold harmless the Sellers and their

representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any Covered Losses suffered by any such Seller Indemnitees resulting from or
arising out of: (i) any misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser referenced in Section 9.01(a);
(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by the
Purchaser in the Purchase Agreements that survives the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 9.01(b); (iii) the Purchased Assets; (iv) the Guarantees; (v) the
Assumed Liabilities; and (vi) all penalties and reasonable costs and expenses

counsel) arising out of or related to any indemnification made under this
Section 9.03.

(b) The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 9.03 after the expiration of the applicable survival
period referenced in Section 9.01; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, on or
prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim
shall have been given to the Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.04 for
such indemnification, the Seller Indemnitees shall continue to have the right
to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such claim
for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in
this Article IX; provided, further, that the representations contained in
Sections 5.01, 5.02 and 5.03 hereof and the right of the Sellers to seek
indemnification with respect thereto shall survive indefinitely, and the
representations contained in Section 5.06 hereof and the right of the Sellers
to seek indemnification with respect 



 

- 73 \-  thereto shall survive until the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to the matters described therein (including extensions thereof).

(c) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9.03
shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from the Purchaser or NISL to an account or accounts designated in
writing by the applicable Seller Indemnitee to the Purchaser within 15 days
after the final determination thereof.

(d) The Purchaser and NISL shall have no liability for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.03(a) with respect to Covered Losses for which
indemnification is provided thereunder (i) unless such Covered Losses exceed
in the aggregate $500,000, in which case the Purchaser and NISL shall be
liable for all such Covered Losses in excess of such threshold amount;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the Purchaser or NISL have
any liability or indemnification obligation for Covered Losses for claims made
pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i), other than claims for fraud, willful
misconduct, willful misrepresentations, or claims arising out of or relating
to the Assumed Liabilities, in excess of the Cap in the aggregate; provided,
however, that the Cap shall be reduced for all Covered Losses paid by the
Purchaser pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Transition
Services Agreement. No indemnified party shall be entitled to recover from an
indemnifying party more than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

9.04 _Procedures_.

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a Person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 9.02 or 9.03
in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person against
the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in reasonable detail) of the
Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by such
indemnified party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have
been prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the indemnifying
party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which
the indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five (5)
Business Days time after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified
party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(a) _Assumption_. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party; _provided_ , _however,_ that such counsel
is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party and provided further
that the indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably
informed on all aspects of such defense. Should the indemnifying party so
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the 



 

- 74 \-  indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof (other
than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to
give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the indemnifying
party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnified
Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim and which
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with
such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 9.04(b)
to the contrary, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the settlement,
compromise or discharge of any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes (including,
without limitation, any Retained Tax Liability) if (i) the Third Party Claim
at issue could reasonably be expected to result in any additional Tax
liability in excess of $500,000 per year for the Purchaser and its Affiliates
in connection with the Business, and (ii) the Purchaser agrees in writing, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Sellers, to indemnify the
Sellers, from the time that the Sellers notify the Purchaser in writing that
they have a preliminary agreement to settle, compromise or discharge such
Retained Tax Liability (such written notice to include the amount at which
such Retained Tax Liability is proposed to be settled, compromised or
discharged), for their additional defense costs associated with such Retained
Tax Liability and any increase to the amount at which the Sellers proposed to
settle, compromise or discharge such Retained Tax Liability.

(b) _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a
claim against any indemnifying party under Sections 9.02 or 9.03 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party.
Subject to Section 9.01, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Sections 9.02 or 9.03,
except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been
prejudiced by such failure.

(d) _Mitigation_. The Purchaser, NISL and the Sellers shall cooperate with
each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to
which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder,
including by making commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any
such claim or liability; provided, however, that neither Purchaser nor any
Affiliates of Purchaser shall be required to make any claim under
the Purchaser Professional 



 

- 75 \-  Indemnity Insurance Policy. In the event that the Purchaser or the Sellers
shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve
any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
contained herein, the other party shall not be required to indemnify any
Person solely for the portion of Covered Losses that would reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case
may be, had made such efforts; provided, that any such failure to make such
efforts shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligation to
indemnify any Person for the portion of Covered Losses that would not
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Purchaser or the Sellers,
as the case may be, had made such efforts. In the event any indemnified party
mitigates its Covered Losses after it receives payment from an indemnifying
party hereunder (whether through the receipt of insurance proceeds or
otherwise but excluding proceeds from the Purchaser Professional Indemnity
Insurance Policy and excluding any proceeds received by the Purchaser under
its warranty and indemnity insurance for claims in excess of the limit of the
Sellers liability in Section 9.02(c)), the indemnified party shall reimburse
the indemnifying party for any such payment up to the amount of such
mitigation, net of any costs or expenses incurred in mitigating such Covered
Losses.

9.05 _Adjustments_. All payments made pursuant to Article IX shall be treated
by the parties hereto on all applicable Tax Returns as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

Documents contemplated to be executed in connection with the closing of the
transactions contemplated herein and the Confidentiality Agreement, along
with the Seller Disclosure Schedules and the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules,

10.06 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
(a) agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Sellers
or the Purchaser of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth
in this 



 

- 77 \-  Agreement, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the other party (as applicable), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other party under this Agreement, and (b) waive any requirement for
security or the posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. The
Purchaser hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Purchaser, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants
and obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement. The parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
10.06, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 10.06 are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this
Section 10.06 shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for
(or limit any partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific
performance under this Section 10.06 prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this
Section 10.06 or anything set forth in this Section 10.06 restrict or limit
any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article VIII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

10.07 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. By an
instrument in writing the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the
other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of
this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with
or perform.

10.08 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof (or the
