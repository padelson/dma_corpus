CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

SECTION 3.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares irrevocably
accepted for purchase by Merger Sub in the Offer, any Excluded Shares and any
Dissenting Shares, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger Consideration is
payable in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Share held in the treasury of
the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase by Merger Sub in the
Offer) shall automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Shares of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Company.

 

SECTION 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Depository Agent; Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent
shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company approved (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in advance by the Company to
act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares tendered
in the Offer to receive the aggregate Offer Price to which such holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ and to
act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of effecting payments to
the holders of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, and (ii)
enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the receipt of such
aggregate Offer Price and payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Agreement. Promptly after the expiration of the Offer and in any
event, substantially concurrently with the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with (A) the Depository Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Shares irrevocably accepted for purchase by
Merger Sub in the Offer, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Offer Price required to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ and (B)
the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares
irrevocably accepted for purchase by Merger Sub in the Offer, any Excluded
Shares and any Dissenting Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ (such cash deposited pursuant to clause (A) and clause (B),
collectively, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund

 



16

    

 shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available), or a combination of the
foregoing. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Company; _provided_ , that
no such investment or losses shall affect the amounts payable to the holders
of Shares. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Offer Price and the Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace
or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments or other
events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause to be
mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form
reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the Paying
Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ " and, together,
the " _Certificates_ ") or the non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
and delivery of a bond in a reasonable amount, if reasonably required, in
each case pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(e)_) to the Paying Agent for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (and such other
documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such Shares shall be presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __
_ 3.02_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-
Entry Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents" message
in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require) be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt of such agents message (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably require), the Merger Consideration for each Book-
Entry Share.

 

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except
as provided herein or by Law.

 



17

    

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand,
and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this 
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for, and the
Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
reasonably required by the Surviving Company, an indemnity bond reasonable in
amount, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day
of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for
any reason shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 3.04 _Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units
and Performance Stock Units_.

(a) (i) At the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in clause (ii)
below, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a Company
Stock Plan other than the Company ESPP (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
and each restricted stock unit (each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ ") granted
under a Company Stock Plan that is subject to vesting conditions based solely
on continued employment or service to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will, without any action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof,
become fully vested and/or exercisable, as applicable, and will be cancelled
and converted into and will become a right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Company Equity
Award Consideration in respect of such Company Stock Option or Restricted
Stock Unit, as applicable, payable immediately following the Effective Time
(but not later than five (5) days following the Effective Time). All such
payments shall be subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.
Each Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is equal
to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time without payment of any cash consideration.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option granted
under a Company Stock Plan to a person set forth on Section 3.04 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Specified Person_ "), to the extent
subject to vesting conditions based solely on continued employment or service
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and that is otherwise scheduled to
vest on or after April 1, 2021, will, without any action on the part of the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become
a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Company
Equity Award Consideration in respect of such unvested and unexercised Company
Stock Option, payable on or following the applicable vesting date of such
Company Stock Option (but not later than the first payroll date following
such applicable vesting date), subject to the holders continued employment or
service through such vesting date; _provided_ , _ however_, vesting of such
right to receive the cash payment shall accelerate as provided on Section
3.04(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All such payments shall be
subject to all applicable Tax withholding requirements.

 



18

    

(b) (i) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit subject
to performance-based restrictions (each, a " _Performance Stock Unit_ ")
granted under a Company Stock Plan and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, will, without any action on the part of the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the Company Equity Award Consideration in respect of such Performance Stock
Unit payable immediately following the Effective Time (but not later than
five (5) days following the Effective Time).

(ii) For the purposes of _Section_ __ _ 3.04(b)(i)_, the number of
Shares subject to a Performance Stock Unit award will be deemed to be the
number of Shares as set forth on Section 3.04(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(c) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or,
if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company ESPP) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such that (i) with
respect to any Purchase Period(s) (as such term is defined in the Company
ESPP) in progress as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP,
such Purchase Period(s) shall terminate and any option to purchase Shares
under the Company ESPP shall be deemed to have been exercised upon the earlier
to occur of (A) the day that is one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective
Time or (B) the date on which such Purchase Period(s) would otherwise end, and
no additional Purchase Period(s) shall commence under such Company ESPP after
the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the Company
ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his or her rate of
payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, or (B) except to the extent required by applicable Law,
make separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following
the date of this Agreement; (iii) no individual who is not participating in
the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation
in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iv) the amount of
the accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company

interest); and (v) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP
shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to effect the cancellation of Company Stock Options,
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units as of the Effective Time
and to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, and to cause
the Transactions and any other dispositions of Shares or other equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement by each person who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as amended.

 

SECTION 3.05 _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, if the outstanding Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares due to any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Shares
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the payment by Merger Sub
for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer (with respect to
the Offer Price) or the Effective Time (with respect to the Merger
Consideration), the Offer Price as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ and
the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section_ __ _  3.01(a)_ shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the effect thereof.

SECTION 3.06   _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by stockholders that are entitled to demand appraisal and
shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal. At

 the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding and
automatically will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and, except as
otherwise provided by applicable Laws, each holder of Dissenting Shares will
cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares, other than
such rights as are granted under such Section 262\. Such stockholders shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by
them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender, in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and copies of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal under Delaware law;
_provided_ that the Company shall have the right to participate in all such
negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment, or offer or agree to make any
payment, with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 SECTION 3.07 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company,
Merger Sub and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock
Units, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under all applicable Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are
so properly withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub or Parent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Stock
Options, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Stock Units in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be.

accurate and complete copies, dated as of the date of this Agreement, of (a)
the Equity Commitment Letter from the Investors to invest, subject to the
terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate principal amount set forth
therein to Parent (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and (b) an executed commitment
letter from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto, dated as of the date of
this Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitment Letters_ ") to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing in the aggregate principal amount set
forth therein as of the Closing Date (the " _Debt Financing_ " and together
with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "), pursuant to which (x) the
Investors have, and (y) the Debt Financing Sources party to the
Debt Commitment Letter have, committed to provide, subject only to the terms
and conditions contained therein, the Financing, which together with the Other
Sources, represents the full amount of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration (the " _Aggregate Consideration_ "), any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including
all amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04_) and any fees and
expenses of or payable by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
Transaction (such amount collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). Except for
any fee letters or engagement letters (redacted solely with respect to fee
amounts or other sensitive information that does not impact conditionality,
enforceability, availability or the aggregate principal amount of the
Financing) that have been provided to the Company (collectively, the " _Fee
Letter_ "), there are no other side letters, arrangements or understandings,
whether written or oral, with any person relating to the Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Each Financing
Commitment Letter, in the form provided to the Company, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and (in the case of the Equity
Commitment Letter) the applicable Investor, is in full force and effect, has
not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect as of the date hereof, and is enforceable in
accordance with the terms thereof against Parent, Merger Sub and (in the case
of the Equity Commitment Letter) the applicable Investor, and to the Knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to the effect of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity). The
Other Sources are available on the date hereof and will be available to Parent
and Merger Sub at the Acceptance Time to enable Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions pursuant to this Agreement. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV, no event has occurred (and no event is reasonably
expected to occur) which would reasonably be expected to result in any breach
of or constitute a default under (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would result in any breach of or constitute a default under) or
reasonably be expected to result in a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing necessary to
fund the Required Amount (taking into

 



40

    

 account the Other Sources) contemplated thereby to be unavailable or would
reasonably be expected to permit any party to such Financing Commitment Letter
to terminate, or to not make any portion of the funding necessary to fund the
Required Amount (taking into account the Other Sources) under, such Financing
Commitment Letter. Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in Article VI, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account the Other Sources)
will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date or that the full amount
of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account
the Other Sources) contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters to be
funded on the Closing Date will not be available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Each Financing Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented,
terminated, rescinded or modified (and no waiver of any provision thereof has
been granted) and no such amendment, supplement, termination, rescission or
modification is contemplated (other than, in the case of the Debt Commitment
Letter, any amendment, supplement or modification to join additional
arrangers, lenders or commitment parties or as permitted by _Section_ __ _
7.14(b)_). Each Financing Commitment Letter (x) contains all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Investors and the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto, as applicable, to make the applicable portion
of the Required Amount (taking into account the Other Sources) available to
Parent and Merger Sub on the terms set forth therein and (y) does not contain
any contingencies that would permit the applicable Investor or Debt Financing
Source party thereto, as applicable, to reduce, or rescind its obligation to
provide, the total amount of the Financing. The obligations and commitments
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Investors have not indicated that the Equity
Financing will be unavailable. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid on, any and all commitment fees or
other fees to the extent required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof in
connection with the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub will have at the Closing
funds sufficient for the payment of the Required Amount.

(a) The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to provide,
that the Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity
Commitment Letter and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.08(b)_, the Company is
(on its own behalf and on behalf of the Companys stockholders) entitled to
enforce, directly or indirectly, the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance
with its terms against the applicable Investor.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition
to the Closing or to any of the other obligations under this Agreement,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.08(b)(iii)_, that Parent and Merger Sub obtain

person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Offer Documents

continue to receive from the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so
furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or
business plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any of their respective
shareholders or Representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that, except for the representations
and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ , none of the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company, nor any of their respective shareholders or
Representatives, nor any other person, has made or is making any warranty with
respect to any matter, including any such estimates, projections, forecasts,
forward-looking statements or business plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking statements or business plans). Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that they have not relied on any information provided by the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, including information in any
"data room," management presentations or any estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans received from the
Company and its Subsidiaries or their Representatives. Parent and Merger Sub

be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (i) the

may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_ in
order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior

Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a
Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(d)(iii)_ in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal, (i) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_, as applicable, (ii) the Company
shall provide Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the person or "group" making the Superior Proposal) and an
unredacted copy of the Acquisition Agreement, (iii) if requested to do so by
Parent, for a period of four (4) Business Days following delivery of such
notice, the Company shall discuss and negotiate in good faith, and shall make
its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith, with
Parent and Parents Representatives, any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing, and (iv) no
earlier than the end of such four (4)-Business Day period, the Company Board
shall determine, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such four
(4)-Business Day period and in consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that its failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material
terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notice references herein to a "four (4)-Business
Day period" shall be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period")
(provided that it is understood and agreed that the actions of the Company
Board in making such determination, providing such notice and such
determination and notice shall not in itself constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement).

 

(h) Prior to effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an
Intervening Event, (i) the Company shall notify Parent in writing that it
intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable
detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change and the material
facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, (ii) if requested
to do so by Parent, for a period of three (3) Business Days following delivery
of such notice, the Company shall discuss and negotiate in good faith, and
shall make its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement to obviate the need for such Adverse
Recommendation Change and (iii) no earlier than the end of such
three (3)-Business Day period, the Company Board shall determine, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement agreed upon by Parent during such three (3)-Business Day period and
in consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change would still reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any material development in an
Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall
require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such
subsequent notice references herein to a "three (3)-Business Day period"
shall be deemed references to a "two (2)-Business Day period").

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange
Act or otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) making any disclosure to
Company stockholders if required under the Exchange Act or if the Company
Board thereof determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to make such statement would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_, and provided further, that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to
be an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action or such disclosure is a "stop-look-and-listen" communication. Nothing
in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ shall prohibit the Company from contacting and
engaging in any discussions with any person or group or their respective
Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of
clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof.

 



49

    

(j) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_ with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer, from any
person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act), other than Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates, relating to (A) any
direct or indirect acquisition, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, of (1) assets constituting 20% or more of the
consolidated assets, revenue or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on the fair market value thereof as
determined in good faith by the Company Board), including an acquisition of
20% or more of such consolidated assets, revenue or net income of the Company
and its Subsidiaries indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests
of a Company Subsidiary, or (2) 20% or more of any class of voting securities
of the Company; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any person beneficially owning, or having the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of any class of voting securities of the
Company; or (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, share exchange, joint venture, restructuring,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
assets, revenue or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (based on the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by
the Company Board) (other than any such transaction among the Company and any
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among its wholly-owned Subsidiaries).

 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any change, effect, event, occurrence or
fact that materially affects the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, that does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal and was not known or
reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement
(or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were not known
or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement), other than any change, effect, event, occurrence or fact (i)
resulting from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company or (ii)
resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic or the related responses of
Governmental Authorities with respect thereto.

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written Acquisition Proposal that
is on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) and after
taking into account the legal, financial, financing, regulatory and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal (x) is reasonably capable of being
consummated in accordance with its terms and (y) if consummated would result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders, from a
financial point of view, than the Merger (taking into account any proposed
amendment or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.03(g)_). For purposes of the reference to "Acquisition Proposal" in this
definition, all references to "20%" will be deemed references to "51%."

 

SECTION 7.04 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to
the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, honor and fulfill in all respects
the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the indemnification
agreements between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and any of
their respective present or former directors and officers (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Company shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification than are set forth in the Company Charter or the Company By-
laws on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



50

    

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement
amounts paid in connection with any Action (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or relating to any action or omission in their capacity as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. To the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay all expenses of each Indemnified
Party in advance of the final disposition of any such Action, subject to
receipt of an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined in accordance with applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such Action, (i) the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, promptly after statements therefor are received, (ii) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any pending or threatened Action to which an Indemnified
Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents thereto in writing, and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , that in the event
that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such six
(6)-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim shall
continue until the disposition of such claim. The rights of each Indemnified
Party under this _Section 7.04(b)_ shall be in addition to any rights such
person may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Company and the Surviving Company or any of
their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain "tail" insurance
policies with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective
Time on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for the six
(6)-year period following the Effective Time at a price not to exceed 300% of
the amount per annum the Company paid for such insurance in its last full
fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Company does not
obtain "tail" insurance prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time;
or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if
available, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the Surviving Company may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions that are not less favorable with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.04(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ that in the
event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current policies,
Parent or the Surviving Company shall be required to obtain as much coverage
as is possible under substantially similar policies for amounts not to exceed
such maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_.

 



51

    

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, and his
or her heirs and legal representatives, each of whom shall be a third-party
beneficiary under this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Company under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_.

SECTION 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the earlier of (i) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time and (ii) December 31, 2021 it shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to: (x) provide each employee of the
Company and of each of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, an "
_Employee_ ") with base compensation and cash incentive opportunities that
are, in each case, not less than what was provided to such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) provide each Employee with
severance payments and benefits in an amount and on terms and conditions that
are no less favorable than those set forth in a Plan or on _Section_ __ _
7.05(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (z) provide the Employees
with all other compensation and employee benefits that are not less favorable
in the aggregate to those provided to such Employee as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (excluding all equity-based compensation).

(b) Employees shall receive credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under any employee benefit
plan of Parent, the Surviving Company, or any of their Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual (solely for
purposes of any vacation policy and severance policy) and eligibility to
receive benefits, (but not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility
under any defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement
medical or other similar benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries under which any Employee may be eligible
to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Employees
vacation and sick time accruals, as of the Effective Time, shall carry over to
Parent, Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ shall be construed to
require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits
for the same period of service or (ii) service credit for benefit accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan or any grandfathered or frozen Parent
benefit plan.

 

(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving Company ("
_Parent Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause the
insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and at-work
conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Employee and any covered dependent under any Parent
Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan, and
(ii) provide credit to each Employee and any covered dependent for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Employee or
covered dependent under the Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and
including the Effective Time. 

(d) To the extent not paid prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay
the 2020 Annual Bonuses as of immediately prior to the Closing. With respect
to annual bonuses payable in respect of fiscal year 2021 (" _2021 Annual
Bonuses_ "), (i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not
determine the performance targets applicable to the 2021 Annual Bonuses (the
" _2021 Annual Bonus Targets_ ") any earlier than the first anniversary of the
date on which the Company Board (or a committee thereof) set the performance
targets for the 2020 Annual Bonuses, (ii) if the 2021 Annual Bonus Targets
are established in accordance with the foregoing prior to the date on which
the Closing occurs, the 2021 Annual Bonus Targets shall be set in a manner
consistent 

 



52

    

 with past practice, and shall not be established without the consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
(iii) if the Closing occurs prior to the date on which the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) determines the 2021 Annual Bonus Targets in accordance
with the preceding clause (i), then Parent shall establish the 2021 Annual
Bonus Targets following the Closing after reasonable consultation with the
senior management of the Company and (iv) Parent shall determine the amounts
due in respect of 2021 Annual Bonuses after the Closing based on actual
performance as compared to the 2021 Annual Bonus Targets.

 

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger will constitute a change in control of the Company
under the terms of the Companys employee plans, programs, arrangements and
contracts containing provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights
upon a change in control or similar transaction.

 

(f) The provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ are included for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.05_, whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or
other rights in any other person, including, without limitation, any employee,
former employee, any participant in any Plan or other benefit plan or
arrangement, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to
continued employment with the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing contained herein,
whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, or
shall limit the right of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate
or otherwise modify any Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement in
accordance with its terms in a manner that does not conflict with or
contravene the obligations of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective affiliates under this _Section_ __ _  7.05_.

SECTION 7.06 _Further Action_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the
Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain
all authorizations, consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and
waivers of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) provide
such other information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental
Authority may lawfully request in connection herewith. Each party shall make
its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than five (5) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and shall make any other filing pursuant to
any other Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable. The parties shall supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent will pay all fees or make other
payments to any Governmental Authority in order to make such filings or obtain
any such authorizations, consents, Orders or approvals.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.06(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of such of Parents, Merger
Subs and their respective Subsidiaries assets, properties or businesses or
of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent and Merger
Sub pursuant hereto, and entering into such other arrangements, as are
necessary or advisable in 

 



53

    

 order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Order in any suit or proceeding that would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all action necessary, including litigation on the merits and defending
any Action in order to resist avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would
prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions or which would prevent the
consummation of the Transactions prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates be required under this Agreement to commence, threaten or
otherwise seek to commence any Action against any Governmental Authority.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party
shall be required, nor shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
be permitted, to (i) take or agree to take any action with respect to the
assets, properties, business or operations of any Investor or any of its
portfolio companies (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing, and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) take or commit to take any action with respect to its
assets, properties, business or operations in connection with obtaining the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any
approvals under, the HSR Act or any Authorization, unless, with respect to
this clause (ii), the effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing. 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating thereto and (ii)
keep each other reasonably apprised of the content and status of any
communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other parties
hereto of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act and shall permit the other parties to review in
advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other party
in relation to) any proposed material communication by such party to any
Governmental Authority relating to such matters. None of the parties to this
Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, telephone call or
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any submissions,
filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement unless it consults with the other parties a reasonable amount
of time in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting, telephone call or discussion. The parties to this Agreement
will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of
any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. The parties to
this Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other party as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and may redact the materials as
necessary to (i) remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
(ii) comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

(e) None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or
any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to) enter into any agreement, transaction or any agreement to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that might
reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially
increase the time required, to: (i) consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
Closing, (ii) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act, or the authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals required
under any other Antitrust Law applicable to the

 



54

    

 Transactions, (iii) avoid the entry of, avoid the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other Order that would materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the Transactions or (iv) obtain all authorizations, consents,
Orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

SECTION 7.07 _Obligations of Parent With Respect to Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful
payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and the compliance by
Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and
undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or
advisable to cause Merger Sub to pay, perform and discharge its obligations
hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent
shall not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity of any nature except as
provided in or expressly contemplated by this Agreement. Parent,
immediately following execution of this Agreement, shall cause this Agreement
to be adopted by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (in its capacity as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub) in accordance with applicable Law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

SECTION 7.08 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating
to this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been
agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except with respect
to any matters contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.03_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.01_
or _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before it or any of its Affiliates issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, except to the extent public disclosure is required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq or any United States
national securities exchange on which the Shares are then traded, in which
case the issuing party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party before issuing any press release or making any such public
statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may, without such
consultation, make any public statement in response to questions from the
press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make
internal announcements to employees, make disclosures in documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by the Company with the SEC or make other public statements, so
long as such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties hereto (or
individually in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.08_). Prior to making
any written communications to the employees or independent contractors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the date of first use, and the Company shall consider in good faith
any comments made to such communication (it being understood that any
subsequent communication that sets forth substantially the same information
shall not require compliance with this sentence). Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates may, without consultation with, or consent of, the Company, make
non-public ordinary course disclosures and communications to existing or
prospective general and limited partners, equity holders, members, managers
and investors of such person, if the persons receiving such disclosures and
communications are subject to customary confidentiality restrictions
restricting public dissemination or use of such information; _provided_ , that
such disclosures and communications do not include any material non-public or
proprietary information of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

SECTION 7.09 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock
transfer, value added, use, real property transfer and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Surviving Company agrees to assume liability for
and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real
property transfer and any similar Taxes, as well as any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees that may be imposed upon, payable or incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

SECTION 7.10 _Stock Exchange  De-Listing_. Parent shall cause the
Companys securities to be de-listed from Nasdaq and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective

 



55

    

 Time and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to accomplish the foregoing.

 

SECTION 7.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the commencement of, and promptly advise Parent of any material
developments with respect to, any stockholder litigation brought or threatened
in writing against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the
Transactions (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall be entitled to
direct and control the defense of any such stockholder litigation; _provided_
,  _however_ , the Company shall give Parent the right to consult and
participate in the defense, negotiation or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company
shall not and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, settle any
Transaction Litigation without Parents prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

SECTION 7.12 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law
becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions,
then the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

 

SECTION 7.13 _Certain Filings, Consents_ _and Other Matters_. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection with
the preparation of the Offer Documents, including the Schedule 14D-9, (ii) in
determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required
to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and (iii) in taking such actions or making
any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or
with the Offer Documents, including the Schedule 14D-9, and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. The Company and
Parent shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to obtain consents and waivers
with respect to Contracts to which the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
is a party (which may or may not be obtained); _provided_ , that (A) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be obligated or agree to make
any payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration
(including increased or accelerated payments) or concede anything of monetary
or economic value or amend any contract in any material respect for the
purposes of obtaining any such consents (x) without the prior consent of
Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
and (y) unless the effectiveness of such action or amendment is conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing, and (B) such reasonable cooperation,
including any efforts undertaken to obtain such consent or waiver, or the
failure to obtain any such consent or waiver or any Contract termination as a
result of such failure shall in and of itself result in the failure of any
condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.01_.
The Company shall notify Parent reasonably promptly in writing of the
occurrence of any Default or Potential Rapid Amortization Event (each as
defined in the Securitization Agreement) or default or other event under any
Collateral Transaction Document that would reasonably be expected to result in
any event described in clause (i) of the definition of "Securitization
Adverse Event." The Company shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed
of the actions being taken by the Company and its Subsidiaries to cure such
Default or Potential Rapid Amortization Event, as the case may be, under the
Securitization Agreement or default or other event under such Collateral
Transaction Document.

 SECTION 7.14 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall take all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Required Amount
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in
effect the Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) entering into definitive agreements to consummate the
Equity Financing on the terms and conditions in the Equity Commitment
Letter, which agreements shall be in effect as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, and in no event, later than the

 



56

    

 Closing, (iv) consummating the Equity Commitment contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date (and in any event prior to
the Outside Date) and (v) fully enforcing the rights of Parent and Merger Sub
and the obligations of Investors under the Equity Commitment Letter, including
causing the Investors to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing and (at the
request of the Company) by filing one or more lawsuits against the Investors
to fully enforce the rights of Parent and Merger Sub and the obligations of
Investors thereunder (and the Company shall be entitled to enforce the rights
of Parent and Merger Sub and of the Company and its stockholders by filing
such lawsuits against the Investors on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub and the
Company and its stockholders). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend,
alter, waive, terminate, modify or rescind, or agree to amend, alter,
waive, terminate, modify or rescind, any term of the Equity Commitment Letter
without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent shall promptly (and
in any event within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company of (x) the
expiration or termination (or attempted or purported termination, whether or
not valid) of the Equity Commitment Letter, (y) any breach or threatened
breach by the Investors of the Equity Commitment Letter or (z) any refusal by
the Investors to provide, any stated intent by the Investors to refuse to
provide, or any expression of concern or reservation by the Investors
regarding their obligation or ability to provide, the Required Amount. As soon
as reasonably practicable, after the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub
a written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested
by the Company to the extent material and reasonably related to any of the
circumstances referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.14(a)_ or as to material
activity concerning the status of the Equity Financing.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or use reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives to take all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and subject to
the conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter. Without the
reasonable consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will not permit or
consent to (i) any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision or remedy under, or any assignment of the obligations of the
other parties thereto under any Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent such
amendment, modification, waiver or assignment would (A) reduce the aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to fund the
Required Amount (taking into account the Equity Financing and Other Sources),
(B) expand or impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise expand any of
the conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (C) otherwise reasonably
be expected to adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
(D) delay the funding of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount
(taking into account the Equity Financing and Other Sources) thereunder or
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the availability of all or
a portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into
account the Equity Financing and Other Sources) or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (clauses (A) through (D),
collectively, the " _Consent Requirements_ "), (ii) any waiver of any remedy
available to Parent or Merger Sub under the Financing Commitment Letters and
(iii) early termination of the Financing Commitment Letters (other than in
connection with an amendment and restatement contemplated by the next
sentence). Subject to the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may (I) amend,
amend and restate or supplement the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace
any lender under the Debt Commitment Letter with other lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, syndication agents, documentation, agents or similar
entities and (II) amend or otherwise modify the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (including, without limitation, any existing
debt financing agreement of the Parent, Merger Sub or its Affiliates, under
which the Debt Financing is to be provided) (such agreements, the " _Debt
Financing Agreements_ ") to implement any flex provisions set forth in the Fee
Letter, in each case, solely to the extent such consent, amendment or
modification would not otherwise constitute a Consent Requirement. In the
event of any such assignment, amendment or modification of the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under
such assigned, amended or modified Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to
be "Debt Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts, and
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives, to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter until the earlier of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the valid
termination of this Agreement,

 



57

    

 and to negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions and covenants in the Debt Financing
Agreements and Debt Commitment Letter applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (or
their Affiliates) (and that are within their control) to obtaining the Debt
Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account the
Equity Financing and Other Sources), (iii) negotiate and enter into the Debt
Financing Agreements on terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (as modified, to the extent exercised, by the flex provisions set forth
in the Fee Letter) or on other terms acceptable to Parent that would not
result in the Consent Requirements being applicable, (iv) consummate the Debt
Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account the
Equity Financing and Other Sources) at or prior to the Closing, (v) to the
extent the conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing have been satisfied
by the Parent, Merger Sub, fully enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letter and Debt Financing Agreements to cause the Debt Financing Sources to
comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Financing Agreements and to fund such Debt Financing at Closing and (vi)
comply with their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Debt
Financing Agreement, to the extent constituting conditions to funding
thereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing (i) of any breach
or default by any party to any Financing Commitment Letter or any Financing
Agreement of which Parent becomes aware that would result in the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account the Equity
Financing and the Other Sources) not being available or delayed beyond the
Acceptance Time, (ii) of the receipt by any of Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates or directors, officers, employees, partners, members,
managers or agents of any written notice from any Debt Financing Source, any
lender or any other person with respect to any actual or threatened breach,
dispute, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Commitment
Letter or any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Agreement, (iii) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
necessary to fund the Required Amount (taking into account the Equity
Financing and Other Sources) on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements,
(iv) of the termination or expiration of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreement (except as contemplated in  _Section_ __ _ 7.14(b)_ to
add additional arrangers through an amendment and restatement) and (v) if for
any reason Parent believes in good faith that the full amount of the Other
Sources will not be available as of the Acceptance Time and Offer Closing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, after the Company delivers to Parent or Merger
Sub a written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company to the extent material and reasonably related to any
of the circumstances referred to in this paragraph or as to material activity
concerning the status of the Parents and Merger Subs efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. From the date hereof through the Outside Date, Parent shall
maintain and have available the Other Sources. Parent shall, at or prior to
the Acceptance Time, provide to Merger Sub all or any portion of the Other
Sources necessary for Merger Sub to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to fund the Required
Amount (taking into account the Equity Financing and Other Sources) becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the applicable Debt
Financing Agreements (giving effect to, to the extent exercised, the flex
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter), (1) Parent will promptly (and in any
event, within one (1) Business Day) notify the Company (which may be through
email), _provided_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any
obligation to disclose any portion of any information that (x) is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent or Merger Sub shall have used
its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a manner that
would not waive such privilege (including entering into a joint defense
agreement in customary form), or (y) would contravene any Law, and (2) Parent
will, prior to the occurrence of the Outside Date, obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to fund the
Required Amount (including, if required, pursuant to any refinancing,
refunding or replacement of any existing debt financing of Parent or its
Affiliates) (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event and, in any
event, no later than the Closing Date; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is agreed that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
obligation to pay any fees in excess of what it was obligated to pay under
the original Debt Commitment Letter nor obtain Debt Financing on terms, taken
as a whole, that are less favorable to the

 



58

    

 Parent than those terms contained in the original Debt Financing as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (after giving effect to any "flex
provisions" in the related fee letter as of the date hereof). For purposes of
this Agreement, (x) the terms "Financing" or "Debt Financing" (as the case may
be) as used in this Agreement will be deemed to include any such Alternative
Financing, (y) the term "Debt Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include
any commitment letters with respect to any such Alternative Financing and (z)
the term "Debt Financing Agreements" will be deemed to include any definitive
agreement with respect to the Alternative Financing; _provided_ , that the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be
expanded beyond the obligations specified in this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_
pursuant to any Alternative Financing.

(f) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company shall
provide such reasonable assistance and cooperation as Parent may reasonably
request in connection with any Debt Financing (provided, that such requested
assistance and cooperation does not interfere with the ongoing operation of
the Companys business), including (A) making senior management available for
customary lender meetings, meetings with parties acting as arrangers or
agents, sessions with rating agencies and "roadshow" presentations, conference
calls, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions),
drafting sessions, presentations and sessions with prospective financing
sources, investors and ratings agencies, in each case on reasonable advance
notice and cooperating with prospective lenders in performing their due
diligence, (B) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and
the Debt Financing Sources, in each case in connection with any such Debt
Financing and reasonably cooperating in the preparation of materials for
rating agency presentations, any offering memorandum, marketing materials,

of material non-public information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries contained therein and the delivery of a customary authorization
letter with respect to the bank information memoranda (solely with respect to
that portion pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries) executed by
a senior officer of the Company authorizing the distribution of information
to prospective lenders), lender presentations or similar document, including
reviewing and commenting on Parents draft of a business description with
respect to the Company to be included in marketing materials, (C) furnishing
Parent and its Debt Financing Sources and their respective Representatives
with financial and other pertinent information reasonably available regarding
the Company as may be requested by Parent or as is required to permit Parent
to prepare pro forma financial statements (provided, that Parent shall be
responsible for the preparation of any pro forma financial statements and pro
forma adjustments giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby for
use in connection with the Debt Financing), (D) if requested in writing by a
Debt Financing Source at least seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date,
furnishing to such Debt Financing Source, at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is required by U.S. regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the requirements of 31 C.F.R. §1010.230, (E) assisting
Parent in preparing presentations with respect to corporate, corporate family,
credit, facility and securities ratings from rating agencies, (F) reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (including cooperating with, and take
all actions reasonably requested by, Parent in order to facilitate the

its Subsidiaries (and all premiums and fees payable in connection therewith)
required by its terms to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or
otherwise satisfied or discharged at the Closing upon or simultaneously with
the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing (including, upon such
funding, (w) the repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding
thereunder, (x) the release of all encumbrances, security interests and
collateral, (y) the termination of all guaranties and the agreements
evidencing subordination in connection therewith and (z) the termination or
replacement of all letters of credit outstanding thereunder, in each case at
the Closing), and arranging for delivery to Parent of payoff letters, lien
terminations and other instruments of discharge in customary form and
substance from the applicable administrative agent or other similar agents),
provided, that no such pledging or related documents or agreements shall be

occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the

and its Subsidiaries that may be reasonably requested by Parent, to the extent
that such information is required to obtain the Debt Financing and (I)

 requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing (other than any
solvency certificate), provided, however, that (x) any such certificate will
be not be executed except in connection with the closing of any Debt
Financing and only by officers who will continue after the Effective Time as
an officer of the Surviving Company and (y) no personal liability will be
imposed on the officers or employees involved; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, without limitation, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required under this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ to deliver any Excluded

its Subsidiaries, to the use of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with any Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Companys or its Subsidiaries reputation or goodwill. This _Section_ __ _
7.14(f)_ shall be referred to herein as the "Company Cooperation Covenant".
Any cooperation required in respect of the Company or its Subsidiaries or its
Representatives under this clause (f) shall solely be limited to information
and materials with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (and shall not
include information and materials with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or any
other person).

(g) The Company agrees to provide Parent with the historical financial
statements of the Company required at such time to satisfy clause (b) of
paragraph 6 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter (which may be satisfied
by the filing of the applicable SEC Report contemplated by clause (b) of
paragraph 6 of the Debt Commitment Letter) prior to the Offer Expiration
Time. In the event that the Company reasonably determines that any action
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ or any other action taken in connection
with the Financing could reasonably be expected to result in a Securitization
Adverse Event or result in a breach or inaccuracy in _Section_ __ _ 4.04(c)_,
upon the written request of the Company, Parent shall immediately cease and
cause its Affiliates to immediately cease the taking of such actions.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
7.14_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_
that would (i) (A) contravene any applicable Law or conflict with or violate
the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)
result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens) in connection with
any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which the Company or a Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or
assets is bound or (C) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege, (ii) cause any covenant, representation or warranty in
this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other

prior to the Closing) or (vi) require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
persons who are officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute
or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any
change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement that is effective prior to the Closing (other than
any authorization letter contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_; _provided_
, that in no event shall _Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_ require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to cause any officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is not continuing in such capacity after the Closing to
execute any certificate, document, instrument or agreement). Nothing in
_Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to any of the Financing.

 

(i) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives in connection with cooperation with such Financing
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_.

 



60

    

 In addition, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of
them in connection with any assistance provided pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.14_ or otherwise in connection with the arrangement, negotiation and
consummation of the Financing, and any information used in connection
therewith (other than losses, damages or claims solely resulting from the
material inaccuracy of historical written financial information provided by
the Company pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.14(f)_).

(j) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall be permitted to disclose
such confidential information to the Debt Financing Sources, rating agencies,
prospective lenders and their respective Representatives either (x) pursuant
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and such Debt Financing Sources
and their applicable Representatives shall be deemed to be "Representatives"
thereunder or (y) in accordance with customary confidentiality arrangements
customary for syndication procedures with respect to the relevant Financing.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition to the
Closing that Parent and Merger Sub obtain any Financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, if any Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.08_, continue to be
obligated to complete the Merger and consummate the Transactions.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
hereby acknowledge and agree that any failure by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to comply with the Company Cooperation Covenant shall not be
deemed to result in the failure of a condition to consummation of the Closing
or the Offer under  _ARTICLE VIII_ or otherwise under this Agreement unless
such failure is a Willful and Material Breach and the Debt Financing has not
been obtained primarily as a result of such Willful and Material Breach by the
Company or its Subsidiaries thereunder.

SECTION 7.15 _14d-10  Matters_. Prior to the consummation of the Offer,
to the extent required, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board will
take such steps to cause each employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement pursuant to which consideration is payable to
any officer, director or employee who is a holder of any security of the
Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or

failed to consummate the Offer within three (3) Business Days following the
Offer Expiration Time, (C) the Company has provided irrevocable written notice
to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to such termination that it
is prepared, willing and able to consummate the Transactions and (D) at all
times during such three (3) Business Day period, the Company stood ready,
willing and able to consummate the Transactions; provided, that no party
shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.01(c)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(i)_ during such three (3) Business
Day period.

SECTION 9.02 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the other party.

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further
force or effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
any party or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant
or Representative of such party to any other party, except that (i) this
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_, _Section_ __ _ 7.02(b)_, the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 7.06(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.14(h)_, _Section_ __ _
7.14(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.14(j)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ and Article X shall
remain in full force and effect, the definitions referenced in such Sections,
even if not included in such Sections, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and (ii)
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_, nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for any fraud or Willful and
Material Breach of this Agreement, in each case, prior to the Termination
Date.

 

SECTION 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_. All expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Transactions and all other matters related to the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,

 



63

    

 whether or not the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction is
consummated, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.

 

(a) If this Agreement shall be terminated:

 

(i) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(i)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(i)_, (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company Board or become publicly known, and not withdrawn, prior
to the Offer Expiration Time, and (C) within nine (9) months following the
Termination Date (x) the Company consummates the transaction contemplated by
such Acquisition Proposal or (y) the Company enters into a definitive
agreement in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and such transaction is
consummated at any point in time, then the Company shall pay to Parent the
amount of $268,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_; or

 

(ii) (A) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(ii)_ or (B) the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay
to Parent the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.03(c)_.

 

(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iv)_ or (ii) by
either of the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(c)(i)_, respectively, if, in either case, the
Company would then be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iv)_, then, in each
case, Parent shall pay to the Company an amount of $469,000,000 (the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ ") in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c)_.

(c) The Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable,
payable by the Company or Parent, as applicable, under this _Section_ __ _
9.03_ shall be paid in immediately available funds (i) prior to, or
substantially concurrently with, termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01(d)(iii)_ and (ii) within two (2) Business
Days after the date of the event giving rise to the obligation to make such
payment in all other circumstances. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) the payment to Parent of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub for any loss suffered by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of the failure
of the Transactions to be consummated and, upon such payment in full in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, the Company and other Company
Related Parties, and the Debt Financing Related Parties shall not have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions and (ii) the payment to the Company of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company for any
loss suffered by the Company as a result of the failure of the Transactions to
be consummated and, upon such payment in full in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_, Parent and other Parent Related Parties shall not have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)(i)_,
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(j)(i)_, except that references to "20"% in
the definition thereof shall be deemed to be references to "51%."

 

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the Company
Termination Fee by the Company or the Parent Termination Fee by Parent, as
applicable, is not a penalty, but, in each case, is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company,
as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the
efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee, in the case of the Company, or
the Parent Termination Fee, in the case of Parent, in connection with the
termination of this Agreement more than once. If (i) the Company fails
promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(a)_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that

 



64

    

 results in an award against the Company for such amount, the Company shall
pay to Parent (or its designee) Parents and Merger Subs reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, or (ii) Parent fails promptly to pay
any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_, and, in order to obtain
such a payment, the Company commences a suit that results in an award against
Parent for such amount, Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee) the
Companys reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, in the case of
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , together with interest on the applicable amount
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Offer or the Closing
as and when required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for any or no
reason or either of Parent or Merger Sub otherwise breaches this Agreement or
fails to perform any of its covenants hereunder (in any case, whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), except for (i) the
right of the Company to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.08_, (ii) the rights of the
Company to specific performance to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions thereof and
_Section_ __ _ 10.08_, (iii) the rights of the Company under
the Confidentiality Agreement, (iv) the right of the Company pursuant to the
Limited Guarantee and (v) the right of the Company to receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_, the sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any of their respective former, current or
future officers, employees, directors, partners, equityholders, managers,
members, attorneys, agents, advisors or other Representatives (the " _Company
Related Parties_ ") against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, employees, directors,
partners, equityholders, managers, members, attorneys, agents, advisors or
other Representatives or the Equity Financing Sources (the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for any breach, loss or damage with respect to this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be the right to seek damages against Parent and Merger
Sub to the extent Parent or Merger Sub shall have committed fraud or a Willful
and Material Breach (in either of clause (X) or (Y), a " _Pre-Closing Damages
Proceeding_"); _provided_ , that the monetary damages sought by the Company,
and monetary damages payable by Parent, under all Pre-Closing Damages
Proceedings shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee (the " _Cap_ "), and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall the Company be permitted to seek damages in a Pre-Closing Damages
Proceeding if the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement and to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, except for (1) the rights of the Company
under the Confidentiality Agreement, (2) the rights of the Company to specific
performance to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 10.08_, (3) the rights of the Company to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 10.08_, (4) the right of the Company receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(b)_, (5) the rights of the
Company pursuant to the Limited Guarantee and (6) the right of the Company to
seek and recover monetary damages from Parent up to the amount of the Cap
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_ (subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_, including the
Cap), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, none of the
Parent Related Parties will have any liability to the Company Related Parties,
whether at Law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise, arising from or in
connection with any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that the Company or any
of its Affiliates may have relating to this Agreement (including a failure to
effect the Closing as and when required pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, none of the Company
Related Parties will have any rights or claims against any or the Parent
Related Parties relating to any such matters. In no event shall the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, and the Company shall not cause any of the
Company Related Parties to, seek or cause, authorize or encourage to be sought
on behalf of any such person any damages from, or otherwise bring any claim
or proceeding against, any of the Parent Related Parties arising from or in
connection with any breach of this Agreement, other than (A) pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement, (B) specific performance to enforce the Equity
Commitment Letter in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and

 



65

    

 conditions thereof and _Section_ __ _ 10.08_, (C) for an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 10.08_, (D) payment of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_, (E) the rights of the Company pursuant to the Limited
Guarantee or (F) a Pre-Closing Damages Proceeding against Parent pursuant to
this Agreement (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.03(e)_, including the Cap). Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_ shall
in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in
which Parent or any other Parent Related Party may be liable under this
Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Financing Sources_ " means each of
the Investors and their respective former, current and future Affiliates, and
each of the Investors (and their respective Affiliates) former, current and
future equityholders, members, partners, or Representatives and any heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing; _provided_ , that
"Equity Financing Sources" shall be deemed not to include Parent or Merger
Sub.

SECTION 10.03 _Interpretation and Rules of Construction_. When a reference
is made in this Agreement to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section,
such reference shall be to an Annex, an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made
available" or provided to Parent and Merger Sub, if such documents, materials
or information were at least one (1) calendar day prior to the date hereof
(unless provided in response to a request by Parent or Merger Sub after such
time, in which case, as of such later time) (a) available for review by such
person and its Representatives through the electronic data room entitled
"Project Saturn," which is hosted by Venue Virtual Data Room in connection
with the Transactions, (b) disclosed in a SEC Document filed and publicly
available, or (c) otherwise provided by or on behalf of the Company in writing
to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable
to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the
masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented. All accounting terms used
and not defined herein have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP,
except to the extent otherwise specifically indicated or that the context
otherwise requires. References to "ordinary course" or "ordinary course of
business" refers to the ordinary course of business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company, taken as a whole, materially consistent with past
practice, as well as reasonable actions or omissions taken or to be taken by
the Company in good faith from time to time in response to changing economics
and other conditions, circumstances or events relating to or arising from

 



67

    

 COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures or in connection with the November 3, 2020
United States federal elections and the results thereof. References to a
person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. References to a
"wholly-owned Subsidiary" shall mean, with respect to any Subsidiary of any
person, that 100% of the outstanding capital stock of such Subsidiary is
owned, directly or indirectly, by such person and/or its other wholly-owned
Subsidiaries. References to a "wholly-owned Company Subsidiary" shall mean,
with respect to any Company Subsidiary, that 100% of the outstanding capital
stock of such Company Subsidiary is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company and/or its other wholly-owned Subsidiaries. If the last day of a
period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement is not a Business Day, the
period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Each of the
parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. References to "days"
shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated otherwise. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Company Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Company Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on
the part of Parent and the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action. All references herein to
"parties" shall be to the parties hereto unless the context shall otherwise
require.

 

SECTION 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, taken together with
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement (together with
any joinders or other agreements entered into in connection therewith), the
Equity Commitment Letter, Limited Guarantee and the Debt Commitment Letter
constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 10.06 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the parties respective rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by
any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto;  _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or
any of their rights and obligations hereunder to (a) any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries or (b) their Debt Financing
Sources for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assigning as collateral in respect of such Financing so long as such
assignment would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. No assignment by any party shall relieve such party of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

SECTION 10.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement,

 



68

    

 express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for (a) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ (which are
for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons after the Effective Time), (b) after the Acceptance Time occurs, for
the rights of the holders of Shares to receive the Offer Price to which they
are entitled to receive in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (c) after the Effective Time occurs, for the rights of the holders
of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled to
receive in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (d) the
rights, at and after the Effective Time, of the holders of the Company Stock
Options, Restricted Stock Units and earned and vested Performance Stock Units
to receive the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.04_, (e) the right
of the Company to damages (including damages based on loss of the economic
benefit of the Transactions to the Companys stockholders) on behalf of the
Companys stockholders, (f) the third-party beneficiary rights specified in
the Equity Commitment Letter, (g) the rights of the Company Related Parties
and Parent Related Parties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03(e)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 10.14 _and (h) the rights of the Debt Financing Sources to
enforce the rights of the Debt Financing Related Parties under  _Section_ __
_ 9.03(c),_ this _Section_ __ _ 10.07_, _Section_ __ _ 10.09_, _Section_ __
_ 10.10_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ and _Section_ __ _
10.14(b)_.

 

SECTION 10.08 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party
agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other
party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or the Equity
Commitment Letter, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it whether in Law, equity or
otherwise, including monetary damages) to (i) an Order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach
and Parent and Merger Sub agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach or for any other reason. In circumstances where Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company is obligated to consummate any Transaction and such Transaction
has not been consummated, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company expressly
acknowledges and agrees (and will so stipulate in any Proceeding) that the
other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable harm, that
monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and its
stockholders and that such other party on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parents and Merger
Subs or the Companys, as the case may be, obligation to consummate such
Transaction and, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.08(b)_, the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter (and specifically that the Company is entitled to
enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter (whether under this
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter), including causing the Investors
to provide the Equity Financing and otherwise cause Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Transactions on behalf of itself and its stockholders, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub). Each party
further agrees that no other party or any other person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _
10.08_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. In
the event that a party initiates an Action seeking equitable relief pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 10.08_ (including to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other
agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.08_), the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, _plus_ twenty (20)
Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 10.08(a)_ or anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby agree that the Company shall
only be entitled to enforce specifically the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) (other
than the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter that relate to the payment of
fees, if any, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ (the " _Termination_  

 



69

    

  _Commitment_ "), which shall not, in any event, be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.08(b)_), including causing all or any portion of the Equity
Financing (other than the Termination Commitment) to be funded or otherwise
cause Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer or to effect the Merger
(including the obligation to pay the aggregate Offer Price or Merger
Consideration) if (i) with respect to the Offer and the payment of the Offer
Price and the Equity Financing related thereto, the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or waived at or prior to the Offer Expiration Time (other than those
Offer Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Offer
Expiration Time but which were capable of being satisfied at such time), (ii)
with respect to the Merger, the payment of the Merger Consideration and the
Equity Financing related thereto, the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
8.01_ have been satisfied or waived, (iii) the Debt Financing has been
received by Parent in full in accordance with the terms thereof, or the Debt
Financing will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to
draw down the Equity Commitment Letter (other than in respect of the
Termination Commitment) or consummate the Offer and the Closing if the Debt
Financing is not funded at the Acceptance Time) and (iv) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Company will proceed with the Offer Closing (and the Company has not revoked,
withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall the Company be entitled to receive (i) both a grant of
specific performance which results in the consummation of the Merger
(including the funding of the Equity Financing, whether under this Agreement
or the Equity Commitment Letter, and the payment of the
Merger Consideration), on the one hand, and be awarded any monetary damages
whatsoever, on the other hand, or (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.03(f)_,
both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment
of the Parent Termination Fee, on the other hand. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances shall Parent or Merger
Sub be entitled to receive both payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on
the one hand, and payment of the Company Termination Fee, on the other hand.

 

SECTION 10.09 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of
conflicts of law that would cause the application of law of any jurisdiction
other than those of the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, any right or obligation with respect to any Debt Financing Source,
the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and any litigation relating thereto or arising thereunder shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the state of New York
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules and
provisions (except as otherwise contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or
any Debt Financing Agreement, which contemplates the laws of another
jurisdiction shall govern).

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if such court does not have jurisdiction over
such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any
federal or state court located in the State of Delaware. Consistent with
the preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of
Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by either party hereto; (ii) agrees that service of process
will be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.02_; and (iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper,
or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of
the above named courts. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
party acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (A) that any

 



70

    

 Action, whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise,
involving any Debt Financing Related Party arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the
appellate courts thereof) and each party submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court and agrees not to bring (or permit any of its Affiliates to bring
or support anyone else in bringing) any such Action in any other court and (B)
to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Action in any such court.

 

SECTION 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

 

SECTION 10.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, by written
agreement of the parties hereto, at any time prior to the consummation of the
Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, _Section_
__ _ 9.03(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.07_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.09_, _Section_ __
_ 10.10_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ and _Section_
__ _ 10.14(b)_ (and the related definitions of this Agreement solely to the
extent an amendment or modification thereof would modify the substance of such
Sections) may not be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to the
Debt Financing Related Parties, without the prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

SECTION 10.12 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent
(on behalf of itself and Merger Sub), on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, _Section_ __ _ 9.03(c),_ _Section_ __ _ 10.07_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.09_,  _Section_ __ _ 10.10_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, this
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.14(b)_ may not be waived in a
manner that is materially adverse to the Debt Financing Related Parties,
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 

SECTION 10.13 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in each other
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which such information
reasonably relates as though fully set forth in such other Section. Certain
items and matters may be listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule for
informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by
the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or
matters in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to
broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations and warranties
or covenants contained in this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
(a) shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material

 



71

    

 exception or material event, circumstance, change, effect, development or
condition or that such item would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (b) shall not be construed as an admission or indication by the
Company of any non-compliance with, or breach or violation of, any third-party
rights (including any Intellectual Property), any Contract or agreement or any
Law or Order of any Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been made
solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations made
herein or of disclosing any information required to be disclosed under this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.14 _Non-Recourse_.

 

(a) Without limiting any of the express terms or conditions of this
Agreement, each party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
Representatives, that other than pursuant to (A) the Confidentiality
Agreement, (B) pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and (C) pursuant to
the Limited Guarantee, all proceedings, claims, obligations, liabilities or
causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or
otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate to (i) this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), (iii) any breach or violation of this Agreement and (iv)
any failure of the Transactions to be consummated, in each case, may be made
only against (and are those solely of) the persons that are expressly
identified herein as a party to this Agreement (or a party to any such other
agreement referenced herein or contemplated hereunder) and in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement (or the terms
of any such other agreement referenced herein or contemplated hereunder).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and, to the fullest extent legally
permissible, the other Company Related Parties), other than (x) the Companys
rights set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, (x) the Companys, and any of its
Subsidiaries rights in respect of the transactions and agreements
contemplated by the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Debt
Financing Agreements after the Offer Closing, (y) the Companys right to seek
to specifically enforce (or cause Parent or Merger Sub to enforce) the Equity
Commitment Letter, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter and (z) the
Companys rights in respect of the Limited Guarantee, in accordance with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Limited
Guarantee, (i) hereby waives any claims or rights against any Equity Financing
Source or Debt Financing Source relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letters, the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract or
otherwise, and (ii) hereby agrees not to bring or support any Action against
any Equity Financing Source or Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letters, the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract
or otherwise.

 SECTION 10.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

_Annex A_

 

 _Conditions of the Offer_

 

The obligation of Merger Sub to irrevocably accept for purchase and pay for
Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer is
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses "(a)"
through "(i)" below. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer
or the Merger Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub shall not be required to
irrevocably accept for purchase or, subject to any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Exchange Act Rule 14e-l(c) (relating to
Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any tendered Shares,
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article II unless,
immediately prior to the then scheduled applicable Offer Expiration Time: 

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn that number of Shares that (together with any Shares owned by
Parent and its Affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received" (as such term
is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL)) represent at least a
majority of the Shares outstanding as of the consummation of the Offer at the
Offer Expiration Time (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 

(b) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or
been terminated;

 

(c) no Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction sitting in the
United States shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered
any Law, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect that
enjoins, restrains or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger;

 

(d) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.02(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 4.02(b)_ ( _Capitalization_ )
(other than for inaccuracies that are _de minimis_ relative to the total fully
diluted equity capitalization of the Company), _Section_ __ _ 4.04(c)_ (
_No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_ ) and _Section_ __ _ 4.06(a)_ (
_Absence of Certain Changes or Events_ ) shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the consummation
of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the extent any such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in which case
on and as of such specific date) (ii) the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.02(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.02(d)_
and _Section_ __ _ 4.02(e)_ ( _Capitalization_ ) and _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ (
_Authority Relative to This Agreement_ ) shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the
consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time, except to the extent any
such representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date (in
which case on and as of such specific date) and (iii) each of the other
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the consummation of the Offer, as if made at such time,
except to the extent such representation or warranty expressly relates to a
specific date (in which case on and as of such specific date), other than, in
the case of _clause (iii)_ , for such failures to be true and correct that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect (it
being understood that for this purpose all references to the term "Material
Adverse Effect" and other qualifications based on the word "material," set
forth in any such representations and warranties shall be disregarded) (the
"Company Representation Condition");

 

(e) the Company shall have performed or complied with, in all material
respects, each covenant, agreement and obligation required by the Merger
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on or prior to the Offer
Expiration Time;

 

(f) since the date of the Merger Agreement, no Material Adverse Effect
shall have occurred and be continuing;

 

(g) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate, dated as of
the date on which the Offer expires, signed by an executive officer of the
Company, certifying that the conditions specified in _clauses (d)_ , _(e)_ and
_(f)_ have been satisfied;

 



Annex A - 1 

    

(h) the Merger Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ "); and

(i) the Offer Expiration Time shall not occur on or prior to December 18,
2020 (the " _Inside Date Condition_ ").

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, except for the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition
(each of which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company), may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger
Sub, subject in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Applicable
Law. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation
of, the rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
extending, terminating or modifying the Offer pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of
the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the
waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances
shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts
and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this Annex A but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement to which it is attached, except that the
term "Merger Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the Agreement to which
this Annex A is attached.
