                  (d) Assumed Liabilities Related to Assets of Excluded
Subsidiaries. Sellers shall make provision in the Plan and to the extent
applicable in the Scheme of Arrangement, and shall make all necessary transfers
and assumptions and take all other necessary actions, and as applicable shall
cause their Subsidiaries to make such provisions, transfers, and assumptions and
to take such actions, such that, at or upon the Closing, in connection with any
transfer and delivery of FTL Assets from an Excluded Debtor Subsidiary to a
Transferred Subsidiary under Section 1.03(a), a Transferred Subsidiary assumes
and agrees to pay, perform, and discharge when due all Liabilities of the
Excluded Debtor Subsidiary related to such FTL Asset, but only to the extent
that (1) such Excluded Debtor Subsidiary incurred such Liability after the
Petition Date in the ordinary course in the ongoing operation of the Business or
(2) such Excluded Debtor Subsidiary incurred such Liability prior to the
Petition Date in the ongoing operation of the Business and such Liability (x)
has been assumed prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to an Order of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court or C.I. Grand Court as listed on the Schedule of Already
Assumed Obligations, or (y) is assumed by the Excluded Debtor Subsidiary or
Transferred Subsidiary by agreement of the parties hereto pursuant to Section
1.09, except to the extent that any such Liability is discharged in the
Reorganization Cases.

                  (e) Certain Excluded Liabilities. Sellers shall make all
necessary transfers and assumptions and take all other necessary actions, and as
applicable shall cause their Subsidiaries to make such provisions, transfers,
and assumptions and to take such actions, such that, from and after the Closing,
the Transferred Subsidiaries that are not Transferred Debtor Subsidiaries have
no Liability for any of the Liabilities listed on Section 1.03(e) of Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule.

                  (f) FTL Liabilities. The Liabilities of Sellers assumed under
Section 1.02, the Liabilities of the Transferred Debtor Subsidiaries not
discharged under Section 1.03(c)(i), (ii) or (iv), the Liabilities of the
Transferred Subsidiaries that are not Transferred Debtor Subsidiaries (other
than those Liabilities listed on Section 1.03(e) of Sellers' Disclosure
Schedule), the Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiaries and Union under the
Benefit Plans, and the Liabilities of the Excluded Debtor Subsidiaries assumed
under Section 1.03(d) constitute and are referred to herein collectively as the
"FTL Liabilities." The Liabilities excluded from the FTL Liabilities under
Section 1.02, together with the Liabilities to be discharged under Section
1.03(c)(i), (ii) or (iv) and the Liabilities excluded under Section 1.03(e),
constitute and are referred to herein collectively as the "Excluded
Liabilities." The Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiaries immediately
following the Closing shall only include the FTL Liabilities.

                  1.04 Purchase Price; Allocation; Adjustment. (a) The aggregate
purchase price for the FTL Assets is $835,000,000, as adjusted pursuant to
Section 1.04(c), (d) and (e) (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be
payable in cash at the Closing in the manner provided in Section 1.05.

                  (b) Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 1.04(b) of
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule (the "Allocation"). Each party hereto agrees that
no party will take a position on any income, transfer or gains Tax Return,
before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority charged with the collection of
any such Tax or in any judicial proceeding, that is in any manner inconsistent
with the terms of any such allocation without the consent of the other party. If
the Purchase Price, as


                                      -11-
<PAGE>

ultimately determined after the application of Sections 1.04 and 1.08 is
increased or decreased, then the parties shall within ten Business Days after
such determination agree (pursuant to the methodology set forth in Section
1.04(b) of Sellers' Disclosure Schedule) upon the necessary modifications to the
Allocations made pursuant to this Section 1.04(b).

                  (c) Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment. On the second
Business Day prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to
Purchaser a balance sheet for the Business (that is, reflecting only assets that
would be FTL Assets and liabilities that would be FTL Liabilities if the Closing
occurred on the balance sheet date and applying the definitions of Working
Capital Assets and Working Capital Liabilities) (the "FTL Reference Balance
Sheet") prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with Sellers' past
practices and showing Net Working Capital, as of the last Saturday of the most
recent fiscal month preceding the scheduled Closing Date for which such a
balance sheet is available (the date of such balance sheet, the "FTL Reference
Balance Sheet Date"). In no event shall the FTL Reference Balance Sheet Date be
more than 50 days prior to the scheduled Closing Date. Sellers covenant to
prepare the FTL Reference Balance Sheet as promptly as practicable consistent
with good business practices. If the Net Working Capital as reflected on the FTL
Reference Balance Sheet is less than $540,000,000, then the Purchase Price to be
paid at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of such shortfall.

                  (d) Adjustment for Certain Payments. Not less than five
Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to
Purchaser a schedule showing all transactions after the FTL Reference Balance
Sheet Date in which any Working Capital Assets were used to pay, satisfy, or
discharge any Liability that was not a Working Capital Liability when so paid,
satisfied or discharged. On the Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to Purchaser
such schedule updated to the Closing Date. If the Net Working Capital as
reflected on the FTL Reference Balance Sheet is equal to or greater than
$540,000,000 but would be less than $540,000,000 if adjusted to reflect such
transactions, then the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by
the amount that such Net Working Capital (as adjusted to reflect such
transactions) is less than $540,000,000. If the Net Working Capital as reflected
on the FTL Reference Balance Sheet is less than $540,000,000, then the Purchase
Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of such Working
Capital Assets used in such transactions.

                  (e) Funding Deficit. Not later than the last Business Day
before the scheduled Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to Purchaser the
calculation of the Funding Deficit, together with schedules showing how the
calculation was performed, including a schedule or schedules showing the
valuation of each investment in the Pension Plan. The Purchase Price to be paid
at Closing shall be further reduced by the amount of any Funding Deficit.

                  1.05 The Closing; Escrow. (a) Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the transactions herein contemplated shall have been
abandoned pursuant to Section 8.01, and subject to (i) the satisfaction or
waiver (where applicable) of the conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII and
(ii) the delivery of the items required by Section 1.04(c), (d) and (e), the

of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.05, 6.06, 7.05, and 7.06, unless
another date, time or place is mutually agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the "Closing Date").

                  (b) At the direction of and on behalf of Sellers, at the
Closing, (i) Purchaser will pay the Purchase Price less the amounts specified
under clauses (ii) and (iii) below by wire transfer of immediately available
United States funds to the Estates for distribution pursuant to the Plan, such

                  deliver to its immediate parent corporation, pursuant to the
                  Plan, a certificate evidencing newly issued shares of its
                  common stock as the Transferred Subsidiary Interests in such
                  Indirectly Transferred Subsidiary, in each case such
                  certificate to be in genuine and unaltered form, with
                  requisite stock transfer tax stamps, if any, attached, and
                  with such other good and sufficient instruments and
                  documentation required in the applicable jurisdiction in a
                  form and manner which is fully effective in the relevant

                  Transferred Subsidiaries all of the Transferred Subsidiary
                  Interests as contemplated herein (the General Assignment and
                  the other instruments referred to in clauses (i)(II) through
                  (IV) and this clause (ii) being collectively referred to
                  herein as the "Assignment Instruments"); and

                           (iii) Purchaser (or its wholly owned Subsidiary) and
                  the Transferred Subsidiaries, if applicable, will assume from
                  each Seller and Excluded Subsidiary the due payment,
                  performance and discharge of the FTL Liabilities by delivery
                  of (I) one or more Assumption Agreements substantially in the
                  form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Assumption Agreement"), duly
                  executed by the assuming party, and (II) such other good and
                  sufficient instruments of assumption, in form and substance
                  reasonably acceptable to Sellers' counsel, as shall be
                  effective to cause Purchaser (or its wholly owned Subsidiary)
                  and the Transferred Subsidiaries to assume the FTL Liabilities
                  as and to the extent provided in Section 1.02 and Section
                  1.03(d) (the Assumption Agreement and such other instruments
                  referred to in clause (II) being collectively referred to
                  herein as the "Assumption Instruments").

                  (d) At the Closing, there shall also be delivered to Sellers
and Purchaser the certificates and other documents to be delivered under
Articles VI and VII.

                  1.06 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation. (a) Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time
after the Closing, each of the parties hereto (or, with respect to each Seller,
its successors pursuant to the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement) shall execute
and deliver such other documents and instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to more
effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser or a Transferred
Subsidiary, to confirm Purchaser's and the Transferred Subsidiaries' right,
title, and interest in, all of the FTL Assets, to put Purchaser or a Transferred
Subsidiary in actual possession and operating control of the Business and the
FTL Assets, to assist Purchaser and the Transferred Subsidiaries in exercising
all rights with respect thereto, and otherwise to cause Sellers to fulfill their
obligations under this Agreement and the Operative Agreements.

                  (b) Following the Closing, each party (or, with respect to
each Seller, its successors pursuant to the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement)
will afford the other party, its counsel and its accountants, during normal
business hours, reasonable access to the Books and Records and other data
relating to the Business in its possession with respect to periods prior to the
Closing and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that
such access



                                      -14-
<PAGE>

may be reasonably required by the requesting party in connection with (i) the
preparation of Tax Returns, (ii) compliance with the requirements of any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, (iii) the determination or enforcement of
the rights and obligations of any party to this Agreement or any of the
Operative Agreements, (iv) the settlement of the Reorganization Cases, or (v)
any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding. Upon request and in connection
with the settlement of the Reorganization Cases, Purchaser will provide to the
successors of each Seller pursuant to the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement (at
the requesting party's expense) (x) copies of the above referenced information
and (y) reasonable access to the Employees to discuss matters relating to the
Business with respect to periods prior to the Closing.

                  (c) If, in order properly to prepare its Tax Returns, other
documents or reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities or its financial statements or to fulfill its obligations hereunder,
it is necessary that a party be furnished with additional information, documents
or records relating to the Business not referred to in paragraph (b) above, and
such information, documents or records are in the possession or control of the
other party, such other party shall use its best efforts to furnish or make
available such information, documents or records (or copies thereof) at the
recipient's request, in each case at the requesting party's cost and expense.
Any information obtained by such party in accordance with this paragraph shall
be held confidential by such party in accordance with Section 10.07.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 1.06, if the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or
arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records relevant to
such litigation or arbitration in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
Section 1.06 shall be subject to applicable rules relating to discovery.

                  1.07 Insurance Proceeds. If any of the FTL Assets which
otherwise would have been transferred to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement is
destroyed or damaged or taken in condemnation after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, Sellers shall promptly give notice of the same to Purchaser, and
shall cause all necessary repairs or restoration to such properties to be made
promptly to the full extent of all available insurance proceeds. If any such
insurance proceeds or condemnation award are received by such Seller or
Transferred Subsidiary after the Closing, such Seller or Transferred Subsidiary
shall forthwith pay to Purchaser the insurance proceeds or condemnation award so
received less, in the case of insurance proceeds, the amount actually expended
by Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries to perform any repair or restoration
in connection with any such destruction, damage or taking prior to the Closing
Date. As and to the extent that there is available insurance under policies
maintained by Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries, their predecessors and
successors in respect of any FTL Liability, except for any such insurance
proceeds with respect to which the insured is directly or indirectly
self-insured or has agreed to indemnify the insurer, Sellers shall cause such
insurance to be applied toward the payment of such FTL Liability. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 1.07 shall not affect the
right of Purchaser not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if the conditions to its obligations hereunder contained in Sections
6.01 or 6.09 have not been fulfilled.

                  1.08 Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) Within
thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers (i) a balance sheet



                                      -15-
<PAGE>

for the Business as of the Closing Date (the "FTL Final Balance Sheet") and (ii)
a schedule (the "Working Capital Schedule") setting forth (X) Purchaser's
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date
("Closing Date Net Working Capital") and (Y) Purchaser's calculation of the
amount by which the Purchase Price should be adjusted, either upward or
downward, to the extent the Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than or
less than the Adjusted Net Working Capital (such difference being the "Working
Capital Amount Due"). The FTL Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared by Purchaser
in good faith in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with Sellers' past
practices and with the practices applied in preparation of the FTL Reference
Balance Sheet, provided, however, that the FTL Final Balance Sheet, from which
the Working Capital Schedule is prepared, shall reflect as assets only FTL
Assets and shall reflect as liabilities only FTL Liabilities. Purchaser shall
apply the definitions of Working Capital Assets and Working Capital Liabilities
in the preparation of the Working Capital Schedule.

                  (b) Sellers may notify Purchaser in writing within twenty (20)
Business Days following delivery of the Working Capital Schedule (the "Dispute
Period"), that (i) Sellers agree with the Working Capital Schedule (an "Approval
Notice") or (ii) Sellers disagree with such calculations, identifying with
specificity the items with which Sellers disagree (a "Dispute Notice"). Upon
receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Sellers will use good
faith efforts during the five (5) Business Day period following the date of
receipt of a Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period") to resolve any differences
they may have as to the calculations of the Working Capital Schedule. Sellers
may request, and Purchaser shall provide, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the information and data used to calculate the Closing Date
Net Working Capital. If Purchaser and Sellers cannot reach written agreement
during the Resolution Period, within three (3) Business Days thereafter, their
disagreements, limited to only those issues still in dispute, shall be promptly
submitted for arbitration before an independent Big Five Accounting Firm jointly
selected by Purchaser and Sellers (the "Independent Accountant"), which firm
shall conduct such additional review as is necessary to resolve the specific
disagreements referred to it. Based upon such review, the Independent Accountant
shall determine the Working Capital Schedule (the "Independent Accountant
Determination of the Working Capital"). Such determination shall be completed as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than twenty (20) days following
the selection of the Independent Accountant and shall be confirmed by the
Independent Accountant in writing to, and shall be final and binding on,
Purchaser and Sellers for purposes of this Section 1.08.

                  (c) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be paid equally by Purchaser and Sellers.

                  (d) If the Working Capital Amount Due is owed to Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 1.08, then no later than the second Business Day after
the earlier of (i) the receipt by Purchaser of an Approval Notice, (ii) the
expiration of the Dispute Period if Purchaser has not received an Approval
Notice or a Dispute Notice within such period, (iii) the expiration of the
Resolution Period if Purchaser and Sellers have resolved any differences
regarding the Working Capital Schedule within such period and (iv) the receipt
of the Independent Accountant Determination of the Working Capital, Purchaser
and Sellers shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to pay (A) the Working Capital
Amount Due from the Escrow Amount to Purchaser and (B) the remainder of



                                      -16-
<PAGE>

the Escrow Amount, if any, to the Estates on behalf of Sellers, in each case by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, without setoff or deduction of any
kind, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such letter of instruction.

                  (e) If the Working Capital Amount Due is owed to Sellers
pursuant to this Section 1.08, then (A) no later than the fifth Business Day
after the earlier of (i) the receipt by Purchaser of an Approval Notice, (ii)
the expiration of the Dispute Period if Purchaser has not received an Approval
Notice or a Dispute Notice within such period, (iii) the expiration of the
Resolution Period if Purchaser and Sellers have resolved any differences
regarding the Working Capital Schedule within such period and (iv) the receipt
of the Independent Accountant Determination of the Working Capital, Purchaser
shall pay the Working Capital Amount Due to the Estates on behalf of Sellers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds without set-off or deduction of any
kind, and (B) no later than the second Business Day after the earlier of the
dates listed in clauses (i)-(iv) above, Purchaser and Sellers shall deliver a
written notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay the Escrow Amount to the Estates on behalf of Sellers by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, without setoff or deduction of any
kind, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such letter of instruction.

                  (f) If the Purchase Price is increased or decreased pursuant
to Section 1.08(a) and (b), the parties shall within ten Business Days after
such determination agree upon the necessary modifications to the Purchase Price
allocations made pursuant to Section 1.04(b).

                  (g) Interest on and other income from the Escrow Amount shall
be payable in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

                  1.09 Assumption of Contracts Between Execution and Closing.
With respect to all Business Contracts, Real Property Leases, Personal Property
Leases and Licenses entered into prior to the Petition Date (i) (A) as to which
any Seller or Transferred Subsidiary that is a Debtor is a party or (B) which
relates to the FTL Assets or the Business but as to which an Excluded Subsidiary
that is a Debtor is a party and (ii) that has not been assumed or rejected prior
to the date of this Agreement pursuant to an Order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
or C.I. Grand Court, Purchaser agrees that such Seller, a Transferred Subsidiary
or, with respect to those items as to which Union is a party, Newco LLC shall
assume, and Sellers covenant to seek to have such Seller, Transferred Subsidiary
or Newco LLC, as the case may be, assume, those items listed on Section 1.09 of
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule to the extent John Holland, in his reasonable
business judgment, determines such assumption is in the best interests of the
ongoing Business. With respect to those items so assumed, such Seller,
Transferred Subsidiary or Newco LLC, as the case may be, shall be responsible
for paying on or prior to Closing any cure costs associated with such
assumption.

                  1.10 Section 338(h)(10) Election. Purchaser and Sellers shall
(i) cooperate in the preparation of elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and any similar elections under state law ("Elections") with respect to the
purchase from Union of the stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries (except for the
stock of FOL International, Fruit of the Loom Canada, Inc., and Controladora
Fruit of the Loom, S.A. de C.V., and the membership interests in Newco LLC) and
(ii) jointly file such Elections on a timely basis and comply with the rules and
regulations



                                      -17-

applicable to such Elections. Purchaser's "adjusted grossed-up basis" (within
the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) in the
assets of each Transferred Subsidiary shall be allocated in accordance with the
Allocation. Purchaser and Sellers shall, at or prior to Closing, execute all
forms of any nature necessary to effectuate the Elections (including without
limitation IRS Form 8023 and Form 8594). Sellers will pay any Taxes attributable
to the making of the Elections.

                  1.11 Guaranty by Berkshire. Berkshire hereby guarantees the
performance by Purchaser or its assignee(s) of all of its obligations under this
Agreement, including Purchaser's obligation to provide funds as and when
required to pay (i) the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.05 and (ii)
to the extent required, the Working Capital Amount Due, provided, however, that
Berkshire does not guarantee the assumption, payment, performance, or discharge
of any FTL Liabilities.

                                   ARTICLE II

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

                  Except as set forth in the corresponding section of Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule delivered by Sellers to Purchaser prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement ("Sellers' Disclosure Schedule"), each Seller
represents and warrants to Purchaser that as of the date hereof:

                  2.01 Corporate Existence. (a) Each Seller is a corporation or
company duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to conduct the Business as and to the
extent now conducted by it and to own, use and lease its Assets and Properties.

                  (b) Each Transferred Subsidiary is a corporation, company or
limited liability company duly incorporated, organized or formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, organization or formation and has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to conduct the Business as and to
the extent now conducted by it and to own, use and lease its Assets and
Properties, except for such failures to be so formed, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not having, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business. Each Transferred
Subsidiary is qualified, or licensed or admitted to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of its
Assets and Properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing (i) resulting from the
commencement or continuance of the Reorganization Cases or (ii) which are not
having, and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business. Section
2.01(b) of Sellers' Disclosure Schedule sets forth, in the case of a corporation
or company, (w) the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each Transferred
Subsidiary that is a corporation or company, (x) its authorized capital stock,
(y) the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of such
Transferred Subsidiary and (z) the owners of such shares, and, in the case of a
limited liability company (excluding Newco

<PAGE>

LLC), (A) the name and jurisdiction of formation of each Transferred Subsidiary
that is a limited liability company, (B) the name of each Person who owns any
membership, ownership or other equity interests in such Transferred Subsidiary
and (C) the class and amount of the membership, ownership or other equity
interests in such Transferred Subsidiary owned by such Person.

                  2.02 Authority. Each Seller has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Operative
Agreements to which it shall be a party, to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and, upon entry of the Confirmation Order and the Sanction Order,
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement and the Operative Agreements and
the performance by each Seller of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, have
been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of such Seller, and,
upon entry of the Confirmation Order and the Sanction Order, no other corporate
action on the part of such Seller or its stockholders is necessary. Subject to
the entry of an Order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding
Procedures Motion (as to the provisions of this Agreement covered thereby) or
the entry of the Confirmation Order and the Sanction Order (as to the other
provisions of this Agreement), this Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by each Seller and constitutes, and upon the execution and
delivery by each Seller of the Operative Agreements, such Operative Agreements
will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

                  2.03 Capital Stock. The outstanding shares of capital stock or
share capital of, or membership interests, ownership interests or other equity
interests in, as the case may be, each Transferred Subsidiary that comprise the
Transferred Subsidiary Interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned, beneficially and of record, by Sellers or by
other Transferred Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens other than Liens
that will be released or discharged pursuant to the Confirmation Order or the
Sanction Order at or prior to Closing. There are no (i) outstanding Options
obligating any Seller or any Transferred Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares
of capital stock or share capital of, or any membership interests, ownership
interests or other equity interests in, any Transferred Subsidiary or to grant,
extend or enter into any such Option, or (ii) voting trusts, proxies or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions or other arrangements in favor of any
person with respect to the voting of or the right to participate in dividends or
other earnings on any capital stock or share capital of, or any membership
interest, ownership interest or other equity interest in, any Transferred
Subsidiary (other than any such arrangement in favor of a Seller or Transferred
Subsidiary, which arrangement will be terminated on or prior to Closing), or
(iii) commitments, understandings, obligations, or arrangements of a Seller or
any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire or make any payment
in respect of or measured or determined based on the value of capital stock or
share capital of, or any membership interest, ownership interest or other equity
interest in, any Transferred Subsidiary.

                  2.04 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by each Seller
of this Agreement does not, and the execution and delivery by each Seller of
each of the Operative Agreements to which such Seller shall be a party, the
performance by each Seller of its



                                      -19-
<PAGE>

obligations under this Agreement and such Operative Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
performance by any Transferred Subsidiary or Excluded Subsidiary of transfers,
assumptions or other actions required of it by this Agreement or the Operative
Agreements to effect such consummation, will not:

                  (a) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of the Charter Documents of any Seller, or
Transferred Subsidiary or Excluded Subsidiary;

                  (b) result in a violation or breach of any term or provision
of any Law or Order applicable to any Seller, Transferred Subsidiary or Excluded
Subsidiary, or any of the FTL Assets, or any of the Assets and Properties of
such Transferred Subsidiary or Excluded Subsidiary, other than such violations
or breaches (i) which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
any of such Operative Agreements or to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Condition of the Business or (ii) as would occur solely as a result of the
identity or the legal or regulatory status of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates; or

                  (c) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Sellers to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or by any Operative Agreement, or to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder, and would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Condition of the Business, (i) result in a violation or breach of, (ii)
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under,

give to any Person any right of termination, cancellation, acceleration or
modification in or with respect to, or (v) result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien upon any FTL Asset or the Assets and Properties of (or to be
transferred to) any Transferred Subsidiary under, any Contract or License to
which any Seller, Transferred Subsidiary or Excluded Subsidiary, or by which any
FTL Asset or Asset and Property of (or to be transferred to) any Transferred
Subsidiary, is bound.

                  2.05 Governmental Approvals and Filings. No consent, approval
or action of, filing with or notice to any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
is required to be obtained by any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any
of the Operative Agreements, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, except (i) for consents, approvals or actions
of, and filings with or notice to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the C.I. Grand
Court, (ii) for the necessary filings by Sellers under the HSR Act or any
antitrust or competition Law of any foreign jurisdiction applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the expiration or earlier
termination of the applicable waiting period(s) thereunder, (iii) those
consents, approvals, actions or filings as would be required solely as a result
of the identity or the legal or regulatory status of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, and (iv) where the failure to obtain any such consent, approval or
action, to make any such filing or to give any such notice, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability
of Sellers and their Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of such Operative




                                      -20-

discharged pursuant to the Confirmation Order or the Sanction Order:

                  (a) other than the Reorganization Cases, there are no Actions
or Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against,
relating to or affecting, any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Business or any of the FTL Assets which would reasonably be expected (i) to
result in the issuance of an Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements, or (ii)
individually or in the aggregate with other such Actions or Proceedings, to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business or on the Transferred
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

                  (b) except for Orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I.
Grand Court, there are no Orders outstanding against any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate with other such Orders,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition
of the Business or on the Transferred Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

                  2.07 Compliance With Laws and Orders. No Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under any Law or Order applicable
to the Business or the FTL Assets the effect of which, individually or in the
aggregate with other such violations and defaults, would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business or on the
Transferred Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Each Seller and each Transferred
Subsidiary that is a Debtor has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws and Orders applicable to the Reorganization Cases.

                  2.08 Benefit Plans; ERISA. (a) Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business, each Benefit Plan has been

applicable Laws.

                  (b) Each Benefit Plan intended to be qualified has received a
favorable determination from the IRS and, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Condition of the Business, to the Knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred
since that would adversely affect such qualification.

                  (c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate with
all other such "reportable events" and "accumulated funding deficiencies,"
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the
Business: (i) no "reportable event" (as such term is used in section 4043 of
ERISA) (other than those events for which the 30 day notice has been waived
pursuant to the regulations) is pending with respect to any Benefit Plan, and
(ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term is used in section 412 or
4971 of the Code) has occurred during the last 5 years with respect to any
Benefit Plan.

                  (d) No Benefit Plan has been terminated, where such
termination has resulted in liability under Title IV of ERISA that, individually
or in the aggregate with all other such terminations, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business.

                  (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the
Operative Agreements will not (i) entitle any current or former employee of any
Seller or Subsidiary of a Seller to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any other payment or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due to any such employee.

                  (f) There are no pending claims by or on behalf of any Benefit
Plan or by any employee or beneficiary covered under such Benefit Plan or
otherwise involving any such Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits).

                  2.09 Environmental Matters. (a) Each Seller and Transferred
Subsidiary is in compliance with all Laws (but with respect to Sellers, only
insofar as such Laws relate to the FTL Assets), involving the protection of
human health and the environment, except where the failure to be in compliance
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate with other
such failures, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the
Business.

                  (b) Except with respect to Claims that have been or will be
discharged pursuant to the Confirmation Order and/or the Sanction Order, no
written or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, oral notification of a release of a
hazardous substance (as defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA")) has been filed by or on
behalf of any Seller with respect to any FTL Asset or by any Transferred
Subsidiary since CERCLA became effective, and no notice has been received by a
Seller or Transferred Subsidiary informing such Seller or Transferred Subsidiary
of potential liability for a release of a hazardous substance under CERCLA or
any similar state or foreign Law. No site or facility owned or operated, or that
has been owned or operated, by a Seller or any Transferred Subsidiary is or has
been listed on the CERCLIS published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
or on any similar list maintained by any state in which any FTL Asset is
located.

                  (c) None of the FTL Assets or any other Assets and Properties
of any Transferred Subsidiary contains or is affected by the presence of any
Hazardous Substance in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business.

                  (d) No Transferred Subsidiary is liable with respect to any
matter or Claim under or in connection with any applicable Laws or governmental
approvals involving the protection of human health or the environment that
arises from or relates to any Excluded Asset or Excluded Subsidiary.

                  2.10 Entire Business. The sale of FTL Assets by Sellers to
Purchaser and the provisions, transfers, assumptions, and other actions caused
by Sellers of their Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement will effectively
convey to Purchaser all of the FTL Assets and the entire Business and all of the
tangible and intangible property used by Sellers and the



                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Transferred Subsidiaries (whether owned, leased or held under license by Sellers
and the Transferred Subsidiaries, by any of their Affiliates or by others) in
connection with the conduct of the Business as heretofore conducted by Sellers
and the Transferred Subsidiaries (except for the Excluded Assets) including,
without limitation, all tangible Assets and Properties of Sellers and the
Transferred Subsidiaries reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included in
the Quarterly Financial Statements and Assets and Properties acquired since the
Quarterly Financial Statement Date in the conduct of the Business, other than
the Excluded Assets and Assets and Properties disposed of in the ordinary course
of business since such date. There are no shared facilities or services which
are used in connection with any business or other operations of either Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates other than the Business, and, as of the
Closing, neither Sellers nor any Excluded Subsidiary shall hold any License that
is material to the Business.

                  2.11 Financial Statements. Subject to the qualifications
expressed in the opinion of Sellers' auditors dated February 13, 2001, in
connection with Sellers' December 30, 2000 financial statements, each Seller's
audited financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2000 and unaudited
financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2001
(collectively, the "FTL Financial Statements"), as of their respective dates,
fairly present in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the consolidated
financial position of each Seller and their respective consolidated Subsidiaries
as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein). Sellers have not,
since December 31, 2000, made any material change in the accounting practices or
policies applied in the preparation of the FTL Financial Statements. The Books
and Records of Sellers and their Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP.

                  2.12 Taxes.

                  (a) Each of the Transferred Subsidiaries has filed all
material Tax Returns that it was required to file. All such Tax Returns were
correct and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes owed by any of
the Transferred Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid. None of the Transferred Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.

                  (b) There is no material dispute or claim concerning any Tax
liability of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries either (i) claimed or raised by
any authority in writing or (ii) as to which any Seller has Knowledge.

                  (c) None of the Transferred Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

                  (d) None of the Transferred Subsidiaries is a party to any tax
allocation or sharing agreement. None of the Transferred Subsidiaries (i) has
been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax
Return (other than a group the common parent of



                                      -23-
<PAGE>

which was FTL, Inc.) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than any member of the group the common parent of which is FTL, Inc.)
under Reg. ss. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

                  (e) The unpaid Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries, whether
or not then due and payable, (1) did not, as of the Quarterly Financial
Statements Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (other than any reserve
for deferred taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
tax income) set forth on the face of the Quarterly Financial Statements, and (2)
will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for operations and transactions through
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
Transferred Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.

                  2.13 Title to FTL Assets. Each Seller has good and marketable
title to, or in the case of leaseholds, valid leasehold interests in, its Assets
and Properties that comprise part of the FTL Assets, free and clear of any Liens
other than Permitted Liens or Liens that will be released or discharged pursuant
to the Confirmation Order or the Sanction Order at or prior to the Closing. Each
Transferred Subsidiary has good and marketable title to, or in the case of
leaseholds, valid leasehold interests in, its Assets and Properties that
comprise part of the FTL Assets, free and clear of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens or Liens that will be released or discharged pursuant to the
Confirmation Order or the Sanction Order at or prior to the Closing.

                  2.14 Intellectual Property. (a) All Intellectual Property
owned by a Seller or Transferred Subsidiary that is material to the conduct of
the Business is owned free and clear of any Liens or other restrictions upon use
or enjoyment and other than Permitted Liens or Liens that will be released or
discharged pursuant to the Confirmation Order or the Sanction Order at or prior
to the Closing. The trademarks that are included in the Intellectual Property
have either been duly registered with, or are covered by pending applications
filed with, the United States Patent and Trademark Office or such other
applicable offices, foreign or domestic. Sellers have taken such other
commercially reasonable actions to ensure the full protection of their and the
Transferred Subsidiaries' respective rights to, and title and interest in, such
Intellectual Property under applicable Law. Such registrations and filings
remain in full force and effect, in each case to the extent material to the
Business.

                  (b) To the Knowledge of Sellers, no Seller or Transferred
Subsidiary is infringing upon the Intellectual Property rights of any other
Person.

                  2.15 Insurance. All insurance policies of any kind or nature
owned by or issued to any Seller or Transferred Subsidiary, including, without
limitation, policies for fire, life, theft, product liability, public liability,
property damage, other casualty, workers' compensation, employee health and
welfare, title, property and liability, with respect to the Business and/or the
FTL Assets are in full force and effect and are of a nature and provide such
coverage as is sufficient and as is reasonably appropriate or is customarily
carried by companies engaged in business similar to the Business.

                  2.16 Labor Relations. No Seller or Transferred Subsidiary is a
party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, and there are no labor
unions or other organizations representing, purporting to represent or
attempting to represent any employees employed in the operation of the Business.
There has not occurred or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, been threatened any
material strike, slowdown, picketing, work stoppage, concerted



                                      -24-
<PAGE>

refusal to work overtime or other similar labor activity with respect to any
employees employed in the operation of the Business. There are no labor disputes
currently subject to any grievance procedure, arbitration or litigation, or any
Action or Proceeding, and there is no representation petition pending or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened with respect to any employee employed in the
operation of the Business. No Seller or Transferred Subsidiary has received any
notice of the intent of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority responsible for
the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct an investigation relating
to the Business, and no such investigation is in progress.

                  2.17 No Undisclosed Liabilities. No Seller or Transferred
Subsidiary has any Liabilities of any nature arising out of or relating to the
Business, except (i) to the extent disclosed or reserved against in the
Quarterly Financial Statements, (ii) for Liabilities not required by GAAP to be
accrued, disclosed or reserved against in the Quarterly Financial Statements
(other than Liabilities that are known to Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiary,
reasonably estimable, material to the Business, and not required by GAAP to be
accrued, disclosed or reserved against solely because they are judged not to be
probable or reasonably possible to occur), and (iii) for Liabilities that (x)
were incurred after the Quarterly Financial Statement Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (y) individually and in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business.

                  2.18 Breaches of Representations and Warranties. The officers
and directors and the Joint Provisional Liquidators of FTL, Ltd. shall not be
liable for any breach by Sellers of any representation or warranty given in the
Agreement.

                  2.19 Absence of Changes. From the Quarterly Financial
Statement Date to the date of this Agreement, there has not occurred a Material
Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business or any change, event or
development that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business.

                                  ARTICLE III

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

                  Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the
Disclosure Schedule delivered by Purchaser to Sellers prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule"), Purchaser
represents and warrants to Sellers that as of the date hereof:

                  3.01 Corporate Existence. Purchaser is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its
business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its Assets
and Properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for such
failures to be formed, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority which, individually or in the aggregate, are not having, and would not
be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Section 3.01 of Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule lists as of
the date of this Agreement all holdings of Berkshire, whether



                                      -25-
<PAGE>

direct or indirect, of the beneficial ownership of the outstanding voting
securities (or similar ownership interests), and any directors or officers of
Berkshire that are also directors or officers, of any company that engages in
the manufacture, distribution or sale of apparel (other than the sale of apparel
in retail establishments), to the extent that such ownership or director or
officer position must be disclosed in a filing under the HSR Act or antitrust or
competition law of any foreign jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement.

                  3.02 Authority. Purchaser has the requisite corporate power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Operative
Agreements to which it shall be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and such
Operative Agreements, and the performance by Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Purchaser, and no other corporate action on the part of Purchaser
is necessary. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and constitutes, and upon the execution and delivery by Purchaser of
the Operative Agreements, such Operative Agreements will constitute, legal,
valid and binding obligations of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in
accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at Law).

                  3.03 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of
this Agreement does not, and the execution and delivery by Purchaser of the
Operative Agreements, the performance by Purchaser of its obligations under this
Agreement and such Operative Agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not:

                  (a) conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of the Charter Documents of Purchaser;

                  (b) result in a violation or breach of any term or provision
of any Law or Order applicable to Purchaser or any of its Assets and Properties,
other than such violations or breaches as would occur solely as a result of the
identity or the legal or regulatory status of Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates; or

                  (c) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by any of such Operative
Agreements or to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder, (i) result in
a violation or breach of, (ii) constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) a default under, (iii) require Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries to obtain any consent, approval or action of, make any filing with
or give any notice to any Person as a result or under the terms of, or (iv)
result in or give to any Person any right of termination, cancellation,
acceleration or modification in or with respect to, or (v) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon Purchaser or any of its Assets and
Properties under, any Contract or License to which Purchaser or any of its
Assets and Properties is bound.

                  3.04 Governmental Approvals and Filings. No consent, approval
or action of, filing with or notice to any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
is required to be obtained by


                                      -26-

<PAGE>
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement, or any of the Operative Agreements or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except (i) for
consents, approvals or actions of, and filings with or notices to the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, (ii) for necessary filings by Purchaser or its Affiliates
under the HSR Act or any antitrust or competition Law of any foreign
jurisdiction applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting period(s)
thereunder, (iii) those consents, approvals, actions or filings as would be
required solely as a result of the identity or the legal or regulatory status of
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, and (iv) where the failure to
obtain any such consent, approval or action, to make any such filing or to give
any such notice would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect Purchaser
in any material respect or the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of such Operative Agreements
or to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.

                  3.05 Legal Proceedings. Except for the Reorganization Cases,
there are no Actions or Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against, relating to or affecting, Purchaser or any of its Assets and
Properties which would reasonably be expected to result in the issuance of an
Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of
the Operative Agreements.

                  3.06 Financing. Berkshire has sufficient cash and/or available
credit facilities to provide Purchaser and/or its assignees with the funds to
pay the Purchase Price, to make any Working Capital adjustment payment required
under Section 1.08 and to make all other necessary payments of fees and expenses
of Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Operative Agreements.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                              COVENANTS OF SELLERS

                  Each Seller covenants and agrees with Purchaser that, at all
times from and after the date hereof until the Closing (and after the Closing to
the extent expressly contemplated herein), each Seller will, and will cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all covenants and provisions of this Article
IV, except to the extent Purchaser may otherwise consent in writing.

                  4.01 Regulatory and Other Approvals. (a) Sellers will, and
will cause their respective Subsidiaries to, as promptly as practicable, (i) use
all reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, make all
filings with and give all notices to Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or
any other Person required of Sellers for Sellers and Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Operative Agreements, including
without limitation those described in Sections 2.04(c) and 2.05 of Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) provide such other information and communications to
such Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or other Persons as such
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or other Persons may reasonably request
in connection therewith and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser in
connection with the performance of its obligations under Section 5.01. Sellers
will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to, provide prompt
notification to Purchaser when


                                      -27-

<PAGE>


any such consent, approval, action, filing or notice referred to in clause (i)
above is obtained, taken, made or given, as applicable, and will advise
Purchaser of any communications (and, unless precluded by applicable Law,
provide copies of any such communications that are in writing) with any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority or other Person regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements.

                  (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
Sellers in Sections 4.01(a) and 4.02, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any,
as may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby made by
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority. If any action or proceeding in any
domestic or foreign court or other tribunal is instituted or threatened to be
instituted by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law, Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, use all reasonable efforts to take such
action (but not including holding separate or divesting or agreeing to hold
separate or to divest any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Sellers
or any of its Affiliates) as will (i) resolve any objections which any such
Governmental or Regulatory Authority may have to such transactions, (ii) avoid
the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order which has, or will have, the effect of
preventing or interfering with the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) obtain approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority.

                  4.02 HSR Filings. In addition to and without limiting the
covenants contained in Section 4.01, Sellers will, and will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, (a) take promptly all actions necessary to make the
filings required of Sellers or their respective Affiliates under the HSR Act,
(b) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information received by Sellers or their respective Affiliates from the Federal
Trade Commission ("FTC") or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
("DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c) cooperate with Purchaser in connection
with Purchaser's filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the DOJ or state attorneys general.

                  4.03 Bidding Procedures. Each Seller acknowledges that this
Agreement is the culmination of an extensive process undertaken by Sellers to
identify and negotiate a transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay the
highest and best purchase price for the FTL Assets while assuming or otherwise
satisfying the FTL Liabilities. Set forth on Exhibit H hereto are the bidding
procedures (the "Bidding Procedures") to be employed, subject only to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court approval (the form of which is also set forth on Exhibit H),
with respect to the sale of the Business. Within two (2) Business Days of the
date of this Agreement, Sellers will apply to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
approval of the Bidding Procedures and of the provisions of this Agreement to be
performed by Sellers before the Closing (including Sections 1.09, 4.03, 4.04,
4.05, 4.06, 4.07 and 4.09), and Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 of this Agreement
(including the Termination Fee) ("Bidding Procedures Motion"). The hearing on
the Bidding Procedures Motion shall be held after the date of this Agreement and
the parties shall work in good faith to obtain a hearing date as early as
possible. The sale of the Business is subject to competitive bidding as set
forth in the Bidding Procedures, and approval of the Bidding Procedures Motion
by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The overbid provisions and related bid protections
in the Bidding

                                      -28-

<PAGE>


Procedures are designed to compensate Purchaser for its efforts and agreements
to date and to facilitate a full and fair process designed to maximize the value
of the FTL Assets for the benefit of each Seller's stakeholders. Sellers will
not change or attempt to change the Bidding Procedures without approval of
Purchaser.

                  4.04 Conduct of Business. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
operate the Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to:

                  (a) preserve intact the present business organization and
reputation of the Business in all material respects, keep available (subject to
dismissals and retirements in the ordinary course of business) the services of

lenders and other Persons with whom Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries
otherwise have significant relationships in connection with the Business;

                  (b) maintain the FTL Assets in good working order and

forth in Section 4.04(e) of Sellers' Disclosure Schedule; and

                  (f) prevent any Transferred Subsidiary from taking any action
that Sellers are prohibited from taking pursuant to Section 4.05 of this
Agreement.

                  4.05 Certain Restrictions. Except as expressly provided for in
this Agreement, or the Operative Agreements, Sellers will, and will cause their
respective Transferred Subsidiaries to, refrain from:

                  (a) other than in the ordinary course of business, acquiring
or disposing of, or incurring any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on, any
Assets and Properties used in, of, or related to the Business, other than any
disposals pursuant to the Order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, dated April 19,

                  (m) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent

                  (n) entering into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

                  4.06 Affiliate Transactions. Prior to the Closing and except
as provided in the Plan or the Scheme of Arrangement, Sellers will not engage in
any transaction with any officer, director or Affiliate of any Seller or of any
Transferred Subsidiary outside the ordinary course of business, nor will Sellers
fail to prevent any such action by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, other
than as mandated by an Order of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand
Court.

                  4.07 Bankruptcy Court Approvals. The provisions in this
Section 4.07 shall terminate in the event that Purchaser is not the Successful
Bidder pursuant to the Bidding Procedures.

                  (a) Upon the issuance by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of an Order
approving the Bidding Procedures Motion, each Seller shall, and shall cause each
of the other Debtors to, amend the Plan, the Scheme of Arrangement, the
Disclosure Statement and the Explanatory Statement to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and without terms or conditions inconsistent with those set forth
herein, and thereafter Sellers shall, and shall cause each of the other Debtors
to, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the entry of the Confirmation
Order and the Sanction Order as soon as practicable. Prior to the filing by any
Debtor of the Plan, the Scheme of Arrangement, the Disclosure Statement, the
Explanatory Statement, any amendment to the foregoing, or any motion or other
pleading describing or affecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Operative Agreements, with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand
Court, Sellers shall provide a copy thereof to Purchaser and its counsel, and
Purchaser and its counsel shall be

                                      -31-

<PAGE>


given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document,
amendment, motion or pleading, which comments, if substantive, shall not without
substantial reason be excluded from the document, amendment, pleading or motion
filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand Court. The Debtors shall
not file any pleading or take other action in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the
C.I. Grand Court in a manner that has or would reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of the Business, or on the transactions
contemplated hereby, or on the ability of Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Operative
Agreements, or that is inconsistent with fully performing and carrying out the
provisions of this Agreement, without first obtaining the written consent of
Purchaser. Sellers shall send by facsimile, to Purchaser and to counsel for
Purchaser, on the same day as filing, copies of any and all pleadings filed by
the Debtors with respect to the Reorganization Cases or C.I. Proceedings.

                  (b) Sellers agree to, and shall cause each of the other
Debtors to, ensure that the amended Disclosure Statement and the amended
Explanatory Statement, as filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the C.I.
Grand Court, contain adequate information and otherwise comply with the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Law. The amended Disclosure Statement and
the amended Explanatory Statement shall contain a recommendation of the Boards
of Directors of each of Sellers and other Debtors that holders of claims against
or interests in the Debtors entitled to vote on the Plan and/or the Scheme of
Arrangement vote to accept the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement. Sellers shall
promptly notify Purchaser if at any time before the Effective Date they become
aware that the Disclosure Statement and/or the Explanatory Statement contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. In such event, Sellers shall make the appropriate filings with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the C.I. Grand Court regarding such misstatement or
omission and take such other actions to address such misstatement or omission as
required by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the C.I. Grand Court.

                  (c) If the Confirmation Order, the Sanction Order or any other
Orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand Court relating to this
Agreement, the Disclosure Statement, the Explanatory Statement, the solicitation
of acceptance of the Plan or Scheme of Arrangement or confirmation of the Plan
or sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement shall be appealed by any party (or a
petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing or reargument shall be filed
with respect thereto), Sellers agree to take such steps, if any, as may be
reasonable and appropriate to prosecute such appeal, petition or motion or
defend against such appeal, petition or motion and to use reasonable efforts to
obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion, all with
the objective of effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (d) Sellers will request that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court enter
an Order, not later than the date of the first hearing before the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for approval of the amended Disclosure Statement, finding that
Sellers conducted the Auction and selected Purchaser as the Successful Bidder in
accordance with the Bidding Procedures, that the Auction was fair in substance
and procedure, and that this Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer
for the Business.

                                      -32-

<PAGE>


                  (e) The Plan and Scheme of Arrangement shall provide that each
Seller and, to the extent applicable, each Excluded Subsidiary shall promptly
change its corporate name to a name not including "Fruit of the Loom" or any
derivative or similar name and shall promptly cease using such name and any
derivative or similar name, provided that the use of "FOL" shall be permitted.
In addition, the Plan shall provide that any liquidation of Union or FTL Inc.
shall occur no earlier than the day after the Closing Date.

                  4.08 Tax Matters. (a) Conveyance Taxes. Subject to Section
1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, share transfer and stamp duty or taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar Taxes (together, the
"Conveyance Taxes") which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not exempted from any such Conveyance Tax
under Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, Sellers shall be liable for and shall
hold Purchaser harmless against such Conveyance Taxes and adequate provision
shall be made in the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement, for payment of all
amounts that may be owed in connection with such Conveyance Taxes.

                  (b) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing agreement between
a Transferred Subsidiary and any other Person will be terminated prior to the
Closing and will have no further effect for any taxable year.

                  (c) Tax Returns. Sellers will include the income of the
Transferred Subsidiaries (including any deferred income triggered into income by
Reg. ss. 1.1502-13 or Reg. ss. 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into
income under Reg. ss. 1.1502-19) on their consolidated federal income Tax
Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal income
Taxes attributable to such income. Similar principles will apply to cause
Sellers to include the income of the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to
any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law. Sellers will prepare
and file all Tax Returns for the Transferred Subsidiaries for taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay (and adequate provision
shall be made in the Plan for the payment by Sellers of) any income or franchise
Taxes due to any state or local taxing authority with respect thereto, including
any Taxes attributable to the transactions and elections undertaken to
effectuate this Agreement; provided that Purchaser shall prepare and file all
non-U.S. foreign Tax Returns for the Transferred Subsidiaries that are due
after the Closing Date. Sellers will (and will cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries to) allow Purchaser an opportunity solely to review and comment on
any Tax Return (including any amended return or claim for refund) filed by
Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries and, solely as to non-U.S. foreign Tax
Returns shall not file, or permit the Transferred Subsidiaries to file, any such
non-U.S. foreign Tax Return (including any amended return or claim for refund)
without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Purchaser will prepare all Tax Returns for the Transferred
Subsidiaries for taxable periods beginning before and ending after the Closing
Date ("Straddle Period Returns"), provided that, to the extent permitted by Law,
such Straddle Period Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice and consistent with the consolidated federal income Tax Return filed by
Sellers pursuant to this Section 4.08(c). Purchaser shall allow Sellers an
opportunity solely to review and comment on any Straddle Period Return and shall
not


                                      -33-

<PAGE>


file any such Straddle Period Return without the consent of Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Sellers and Purchaser cannot
agree on any position to be taken on any Tax Return that is subject to the
consent of the other party, an independent "Big 5" accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser shall be retained to determine the position
to be taken on such Tax Return, and the decision of such independent accounting
firm shall be final, non-appealable and binding on Sellers and Purchaser. The
cost attributable to retaining such accounting firm shall be the responsibility
of the party whose position, as measured by reference to the tax liability of
the entity whose Tax Return is at issue, is at the largest dollar variance from
the position that the accounting firm determines to be correct.

                  (d) Audits. Sellers will (and will cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries to) keep Purchaser timely informed of, and allow Purchaser and its
counsel to participate in, any audits of, or discussions or proceedings with
respect to, the Transferred Subsidiaries' non-U.S. foreign Tax Returns and will
not settle (or permit a Transferred Subsidiary to settle) any audit of the
Transferred Subsidiaries' non-U.S. foreign Tax Returns without the consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (e) Newco LLC. Union will own, from the date of the formation
of Newco LLC until its sale as contemplated by this Agreement, 100 percent of
the membership interests in, and be the sole owner of, Newco LLC. No election
has or will be made to treat Newco LLC as a corporation for Tax purposes. Newco
LLC will at all times be treated as a disregarded entity for Tax purposes to the
extent permitted by Law. Sellers will treat Union's sale of Newco LLC membership
interests to Purchaser as the sale by Union of the assets of Newco LLC for Tax
purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

                  4.09 No Solicitations. From the date hereof, subject to the
exceptions stated in this Section 4.09 and except for actions expressly
permitted by the Bidding Procedures, Sellers will not take, nor will they permit
any of their respective Affiliates (or authorize or permit any of the
Representatives acting for or on behalf of Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates) to take, directly or indirectly, any action to solicit, negotiate,
assist or otherwise facilitate (including by furnishing confidential information
with respect to the Business or permitting access to the Assets and Properties
and Books and Records of Sellers or their Subsidiaries) any offer or inquiry
from any Person concerning an Alternative Transaction. If Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates (or any Representative acting for or on their
behalf) receives from any Person any offer, inquiry or informational request
referred to above, Sellers will promptly advise such Person, by written notice,
of the terms of this Section 4.09 and the Bidding Procedures and will promptly,
orally and in writing, advise Purchaser of such offer, inquiry or request and
deliver a copy of such notice to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subsequent to the selection of Purchaser as the Successful Bidder in accordance
with the Bidding Procedures, the Boards of Directors of Sellers shall be
entitled to furnish information to or enter into discussions or negotiations
with any Person that makes, after the date hereof, a bona fide unsolicited
written proposal for an Alternative Transaction, if and only to the extent that
(A) the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issues an Order that the Boards of Directors of
Sellers do so, (B) Sellers shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such Person in customary form and having terms and conditions no less
favorable to Sellers than the Confidentiality Agreement, (C) Sellers shall have
promptly provided Purchaser with a copy of such Order and, prior to furnishing
such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, Sellers shall have provided

                                      -34-

<PAGE>


written notice to Purchaser to the effect that it is furnishing information to,
or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, which notice
shall identify such Person and the proposed terms of such Alternative
Transaction in reasonable detail, and (D) Sellers keep Purchaser reasonably
informed of the status and all material information with respect to any such
discussions or negotiations. Nothing in this Section 4.09 shall (x) permit
Sellers to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article
VIII), (y) permit Sellers to enter into any agreement with respect to an
Alternative Transaction for so long as this Agreement remains in effect (it
being agreed that for so long as this Agreement remains in effect, Sellers shall
not enter into any agreement with any Person that provides for, or in any way
facilitates, an Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement
under the circumstances described above)), or (z) affect any other obligation of
Sellers under this Agreement.

                  4.10 Fulfillment of Conditions. Sellers will, and will cause
their Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver at or prior to the Closing each
Operative Agreement that they are required hereby to execute and deliver as a
condition to the Closing and will take all commercially reasonable steps
necessary and proceed diligently and in good faith to satisfy each condition to
the obligations of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

                  4.11 Access to Information. Each Seller shall, and shall cause
each Transferred Subsidiary, and their respective officers, employees, and other
representatives to, afford to Purchaser and its representatives reasonable
access to its properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and shall, and shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary, and their respective
officers, employees and representatives to, furnish promptly to Purchaser any
and all information concerning its business, properties, financial condition,
operations and personnel as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request.
No investigation pursuant to this Section 4.11 shall affect any representations
or warranties of Sellers herein or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE V
                             COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

                  Purchaser covenants and agrees with Sellers that, at all times
from and after the date hereof until the Closing (and after the Closing to the
extent expressly contemplated herein), Purchaser will comply with all covenants
and provisions of this Article V, except to the extent Sellers may otherwise
consent in writing.

                  5.01 Regulatory and Other Approvals. (a) Purchaser will, as
promptly as practicable, (i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain all consents,
approvals or actions of, make all filings with and give all notices to
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or any other Person required of Purchaser
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Operative
Agreements, (ii) provide such other information and communications to such
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or other Persons as such Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities or other Persons may reasonably request in connection
therewith, and (iii) provide reasonable cooperation to Sellers in connection
with the performance of their obligations under Sections 4.01 and 4.02.
Purchaser will provide prompt notification to Sellers when any such consent,
approval, action, filing or notice referred to in clause (i) above is obtained,
taken, made or given, as applicable, and will advise Sellers of any
communications (and, unless precluded by applicable Law,

                                      -35-

<PAGE>


provide copies of any such communications that are in writing) with any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority or other Person regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements.

                  (b) In addition to and without limiting Purchaser's covenants
contained in paragraph (a) above, Berkshire shall, and shall cause Purchaser and
its other Affiliates to, (i) take promptly all actions necessary to make the
filings required of Purchaser or its Affiliates under the HSR Act, (ii) comply
at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional information
received by Purchaser or its Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the
HSR Act, (iii) cooperate with Sellers in connection with their filing under the
HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by either
the FTC or the DOJ or state attorneys general, and (iv) not knowingly take or
cause to be taken any action, including the acquisition of any business, voting
securities (or other ownership interests) or assets, which would reasonably be
expected to materially delay or prevent any consents, approvals and actions of
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority (including under the HSR Act and any
antitrust or competition Law of any foreign jurisdiction) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
Purchaser as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, Purchaser shall use all
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby made by any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority. If any action or proceeding in any domestic or foreign
court or other tribunal is instituted or threatened to be instituted by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any law, Purchaser shall use all reasonable
efforts to take such action (but not including holding separate or divesting or
agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses, product lines or
assets of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any Seller or Transferred
Subsidiaries or any part of the Business) as will (i) resolve any objections
which any such Governmental or Regulatory Authority may have to such
transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order which has, or will have,
the effect of preventing or interfering with the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) obtain approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby by any Governmental or Regulatory Authority.

                  5.02 Bankruptcy Court Approvals. (a) Purchaser shall assist
and cooperate with the Debtors in their efforts to amend the Plan, the Scheme of
Arrangement, Disclosure Statement, and the Explanatory Statement to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and to obtain the entry of the Confirmation Order
and the Sanction Order. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers and each of the
Debtors with respect to any description of Purchaser and Berkshire in any of the
Plan, the Scheme of Arrangement, the Disclosure Statement or the Explanatory
Statement. Purchaser shall not file any pleading or take other action in the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand Court with respect to this Agreement,
the Plan, the Scheme of Arrangement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby that is inconsistent with fully performing and
carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, without first obtaining the
written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that nothing

                                      -36-

<PAGE>


contained in the foregoing shall be construed to limit in any way Purchaser's
rights under this Agreement, including Purchaser's rights under Article VIII
hereof, or to limit Purchaser's or its Affiliates' rights to advocate for the
approval of this Agreement and against any Alternative Transaction or Plan that
does not effectuate this Agreement.

                  (b) Purchaser agrees to assist and cooperate with the Debtors
to ensure that the Plan, the Scheme of Arrangement, the amended Disclosure
Statement and the amended Explanatory Statement, as filed with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court and the C.I. Grand Court, contain adequate information.
Purchaser shall from time to time furnish to the Debtors all such information
about Purchaser and Berkshire required to be disclosed in the Disclosure
Statement and the Explanatory Statement. Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Debtors if at any time before the Effective Date it becomes aware that the
Disclosure Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

                  (c) If the Confirmation Order, the Sanction Order or any other
Orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand Court relating to this
Agreement, the Disclosure Statement, the Explanatory Statement, the solicitation
of acceptance of the Plan or Scheme of Arrangement or confirmation of the Plan
or sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement shall be appealed by any party (or a
petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing or reargument shall be filed
with respect thereto), Purchaser agrees to take such steps, if any, as may be
reasonable and appropriate to prosecute such appeal, petition or motion or
defend against such appeal, petition or motion and to use reasonable efforts to
obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or motion, with the
objective of effecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  5.03 Letters of Credit/ Surety Bonds. Purchaser shall obtain
substitutions or, at Purchaser's election if allowed by the lender(s) under
Sellers' DIP Facility, secure back-to-back arrangements with respect to the
outstanding letters of credit issued under Sellers' DIP Facility and the
outstanding surety bonds, each as listed on Section 5.03 of Sellers' Disclosure
Schedule, and any replacements thereof, and any other letters of credit issued
under Sellers' DIP Facility and surety bonds arising in the ordinary course of
business subsequent to the date of this Agreement.

                  5.04 Employees. (a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to continue the employment of or to
offer employment to each Employee of Sellers and the Transferred Subsidiaries
other than the Specified Executive Employees and the Employees based in Chicago,
Illinois, at a rate of base salary which is, as of the Closing, no less than the
rate of base salary paid to such employee by such Seller or Transferred
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require Purchaser to cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to employ any such
Employee other than on an exclusively "at will" basis. Purchaser may, but shall
not be obligated to, cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to continue or offer
employment to each of the Specified Executive Employees on terms and at a salary
to be negotiated by such Specified Executive Employee and Purchaser. Each of the
Employees who continues or commences employment with a Transferred

                                      -37-


<PAGE>


Subsidiary as set forth herein is, for the period during which such employee
remains employed by such Transferred Subsidiary, hereinafter referred to as an
"Affected Employee."

                  (b) Subject to paragraph (f) below, for a period of one year
immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries to provide Affected Employees with benefits under the Benefit Plans
(or successor or replacement plans thereto), which benefits, in the aggregate,
are not less favorable than those provided to Affected Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date.

                  (c) Purchaser shall cause to be offered severance benefits to
Affected Employees terminated by Purchaser or a Transferred Subsidiary without
cause within one year of Closing, which benefits, in the aggregate, are not less
favorable than those provided to Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

                  (d) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Affected Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may
be eligible to participate in after the Closing other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Affected
Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
welfare plan maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid during the year in which the Closing occurs in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
welfare plans in which the Affected Employees are eligible to participate after
the Closing.

                  (e) Purchaser understands that the Specified Executive
Employees are entitled to certain benefits including, but not limited to,
emergence, severance, bonus and other similar payments pursuant to court Order
or binding Contract. Purchaser agrees to pay a portion of the Purchase Price (to
be calculated as described below) directly to such Specified Executive Employees
at Closing as settlement of such emergence, severance, bonus and other similar
amounts. At least five Business Days prior to Closing, Sellers shall provide
Purchaser with a schedule listing the (i) names of the Specified Executive
Employees that are to receive such payments, (ii) amount of the Purchase Price
to be paid to each such Specified Executive Employee and (iii) bank account and
any other necessary wire transfer information for each such Specified Executive
Employee (the "Executive Payment Schedule"). The amounts listed on the Executive
Payment Schedule shall be the total amounts to be paid by Purchaser or any

                  10.04 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Operative
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement supersede all prior discussions and
agreements prior to the date hereof between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and contain the sole and entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

                  10.05 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
each party will pay its own costs and expenses, incurred in connection with the
negotiation, execution and closing of this Agreement and the Operative
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

                  10.06 Public Announcements. At all times at or before the
Closing, the parties hereto will not issue or make any reports, statements or
releases to the public with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the consent of the other, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except to the extent that such disclosure is, in the
opinion of counsel, required by Law or by stock exchange regulation, provided
that any such required disclosure shall only be made, to the extent consistent
with Law, after consultation with the other parties hereto; provided, further,
that this Section 10.06 shall not apply to any reports, statements or releases
by Sellers to the public as required under the Bankruptcy Code or the Companies
Law or by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court or the C.I. Grand Court in connection with
the Reorganization Cases.

                  10.07 Confidentiality. Any information or material obtained by
Purchaser or any of its Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sellers'
Disclosure Schedule and information pursuant to Section 4.03) that constitutes
"Evaluation Material" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any information or
material obtained by Sellers or their Representatives pursuant to this Agreement
regarding Purchaser or Berkshire (including, without limitation, Purchaser's
Disclosure Schedule and information pursuant to Section 3.01) shall be treated
as confidential by Sellers and their Representatives in the same manner as
Evaluation Material under the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however, that
the Debtors shall have the right to file Purchaser's Disclosure Schedule and
Sellers' Disclosure Schedule with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the C.I. Grand
Court under seal. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement
shall prevail.

                  10.08 Solicitation Materials. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, following the entry of the Orders approving the
Disclosure Statement and the Explanatory Statement, if the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
and the C.I. Grand Court so authorize Purchaser in such Orders, Purchaser may
send with the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement materials a solicitation letter
seeking acceptance of the Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement by the creditors
and other parties in interest, subject to the approval of the Debtors, which
approval may not be unreasonably withheld.

                  10.09 Waiver. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no
such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly
executed by or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver
by any party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the
same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion.
All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will
be cumulative and not alternative.

                  10.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented
or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each
party hereto.

                  10.11 No Third Party Beneficiary. The terms and provisions of
this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and
their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of
the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

                  10.12 No Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement
nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
attempt to do so will be void, except that Purchaser may assign any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Berkshire. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

                  10.13 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

                  10.14 Retention of Bankruptcy Court Jurisdiction. Subject to
the proviso of the immediately succeeding sentence, and except as otherwise
provided herein, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction of the
proceedings referred to in the Plan, including but not limited for purposes of
determining any and all controversies and disputes arising under or in
connection with, or for purposes of interpreting the provisions of, this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such jurisdiction
shall include any determination as to the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of any
condition to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
Articles VI and VII and any such determination shall be final and binding on the
parties and not subject to any appeal, the right to which is hereby waived by
the parties; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall limit the
rights of the parties to appeal any determination of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
relating to the amount of any monetary damages, fees, costs and expenses awarded
with respect to any such determination as aforesaid.

                  10.15 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a
Contract executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to the
conflicts of laws principles thereof.

                  10.16 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be
fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom.

                  10.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

         is the total amount of the Escrow Fund; and

                      (ii) Sellers shall be entitled to receive the amount of

         it in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel;

         after seeking the advice of legal counsel pursuant to the immediately
         preceding clause, in good faith be uncertain as to its duties or rights
         hereunder, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action in

         directed otherwise in writing by each of the parties hereto or by a
         final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction;

         responsibilities hereunder and exercise any rights hereunder either
         directly or by or through agents or attorneys selected with reasonable

Sellers on the other hand shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the fees of the
Escrow Agent for its services hereunder as and when billed by the Escrow Agent,
and each shall reimburse and indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and hold it
harmless against, one-half (1/2) of any loss, damages, cost or expense,
including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by
the Escrow Agent in connection with the Escrow Agent's performance of its duties
and obligations under this Agreement, as well as the reasonable costs and
expenses of defending against any
                                       4

claim or liability relating to this Agreement; provided that notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be required to indemnify the
Escrow Agent for any such loss, liability, cost or expense arising as a result
of the Escrow Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence or breach of this
Agreement.

                  9.  Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent.

                  (a) The Escrow Agent may resign as such thirty (30) calendar
days following the giving of written notice thereof to Sellers and Purchaser. In
addition, the Escrow Agent may be removed and replaced on a date designated in a
written instrument signed by Sellers and Purchaser and delivered to the Escrow
Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such resignation or removal shall be
effective until a successor escrow agent has acknowledged its appointment as
such as provided in paragraph (c) below. In either event, upon the effective
date of such resignation or removal, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the property
comprising the Escrow Fund and the Interest Account to such successor escrow
agent, together with such records maintained by the Escrow Agent in connection
with its duties hereunder and other information with respect to the Escrow Fund
and the Interest Account as such successor may reasonably request.

                  (b) If a successor escrow agent shall not have acknowledged
its appointment as such as provided in paragraph (c) below, in the case of a
resignation, prior to the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days following the
date of a notice of resignation or, in the case of a removal, on the date
designated for the Escrow Agent's removal, as the case may be, because Sellers
and Purchaser are unable to agree on a successor escrow agent, or for any other
reason, the Escrow Agent may select a successor escrow agent and any such
resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the parties to this
Agreement, provided that any such successor selected by the Escrow Agent shall
be a Permitted Bank referred to in Section 3(a)(iv)(B).

                  (c) Upon written acknowledgment by a successor escrow agent
appointed in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9 of its
agreement to serve as escrow agent hereunder and the receipt of the property
then comprising the Escrow Fund and the Interest Account, the Escrow Agent shall
be fully released and relieved of all duties, responsibilities and obligations
under this Agreement, subject to the proviso contained in Section 6(iii), and
such successor escrow agent shall for all purposes hereof be the Escrow Agent.

the "Agreement"), a copy of which is attached to the Motion, to the Purchaser or
the bidder making the highest or otherwise best offer pursuant to the Bidding
Procedures (the "Successful Bidder"); and the Court having reviewed the Motion;
and it appearing that notice of the Motion was good and sufficient under the
circumstances and that no other or further notice need be given; and the Court
having considered the arguments of counsel at the hearing held on November __,
2001 (the "Bidding Procedures Hearing"), and it appearing that the relief
requested in the Motion with respect to the Bidding Procedures, the Termination
Fee, and Fruit of the Loom's pre-closing performance of obligations under the
Agreement is in the best interests of Fruit of the Loom, its estate, and parties
in interest; and upon the record of the Bidding Procedures Hearing; and after
due deliberation thereon; and good cause appearing therefor, it is hereby

                                       2

         FOUND AND DETERMINED THAT:(2)

                  A. Fruit of the Loom has articulated good and sufficient
reasons for approving the Bidding Procedures.

                  B. Fruit of the Loom's obligation to the Purchaser (under the
conditions and as set forth in the Agreement) to pay the Termination Fee is (a)
an actual and necessary cost and expense of preserving Fruit of the Loom's
estate, within the meaning of section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) of
substantial and commensurate benefit to Fruit of the Loom's estate, (c)
reasonable and appropriate, in light of the size and nature of the transaction
and the efforts that have been and will be expended by the Purchaser, and (d)
necessary to ensure that the Purchaser will continue to pursue its proposed
acquisition of the Company. The Termination Fee was a material inducement for,
and condition of, the Purchaser's entry into the Agreement. The Purchaser is
unwilling to continue its obligation to purchase the Company under the terms of
the Agreement (including subjecting the Agreement to higher or otherwise better
offers as contemplated by the Bidding Procedures), unless it is assured payment
of the Termination Fee in each of the circumstances in which the Termination Fee
may

----------
(2) Findings of fact shall be construed as conclusions of law and conclusions
    of law shall be construed as findings of fact when appropriate.
    See Fed. R. Bankr. P.7052.


                                       3

become payable under the Agreement. Further, because the Termination Fee
induced the Purchaser to research the value of the Company and submit a bid that
will serve as a minimum or floor bid on which other bidders can rely, the
Purchaser has provided a benefit to Fruit of the Loom's estates by increasing
the likelihood that the Seller will receive the best possible price for the
Company. Finally, absent authorization of the Termination Fee, Purchaser's
obligations under the Agreement will terminate and Fruit of the Loom may lose
the opportunity to obtain the highest or otherwise best available offer for the
Company.

                  C. The Bidding Procedures are reasonable and appropriate and
represent the best method for maximizing the value of the Business for the
benefit of Fruit of the Loom estates.

                  D. The provisions of the Agreement, including Sections 1.09,
4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.09, 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 of the Agreement,
providing for the conduct of Fruit of the Loom's business and related matters
during the period prior to the Closing under the Agreement and requiring
performance prior to the closing, are reasonable and appropriate for the period
between the date hereof and the earlier of termination of the Agreement and the
effective date of a plan of reorganization for Seller.

                                                                PROCEDURES ORDER

                    FRUIT OF THE LOOM SALE BIDDING PROCEDURES

                  Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to the Asset Purchase Agreement by and
between Fruit of the Loom, Ltd. and Fruit of the Loom, Inc. collectively the
"Seller"),New FOL, Inc.(the "Purchaser"), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., November
1, 2001 (including all exhibits and agreements attached thereto, the
"Agreement") (*), with respect to the sale (the "Sale"), pursuant to Seller's
Joint Plan of Reorganization and Fruit of the Loom, Ltd.'s Scheme of Arrangement
(collectively, as each may be amended, the "Plan") of substantially all of the
assets used in the basic apparel business (the "Transaction") of the Reorganized
Debtors (collectively, the "Company"), which is subject to competitive bidding
as set forth herein.

                 Notwithstanding the selection of the Successful Bidder (as
hereinafter defined), and the execution of the Agreement (or the Marked
Agreement (as hereinafter defined), as the case may be, the consummation of the
Transaction provided for therein shall be contingent upon, and made pursuant to,
confirmation of, the Plan. The Transaction shall be made, (i) if no other
Qualified Bid (as defined below) is received, with the Purchaser pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement or (ii) if another Qualified Bid
is received by the Seller, with the Purchaser or such other Qualified Bidder (as
defined below) as the Seller, in the exercise of its business judgment, after
consultation with (x) the Unofficial Secured Bank Steering Committee, (y) the Ad
Hoc Committee of Secured Noteholders, and (z) the Official Committee of
Unsecured Creditors of Fruit of the Loom, Inc. (collectively, the "Committees"),
may determine to have made the highest or otherwise best offer in the Auction
(as such term is defined below), consistent with these Bidding Procedures (the
"Successful Bidder").

                           DETERMINATION BY THE SELLER

                  The Seller, after consultation with the Committees, shall (i)
determine whether any person is a Qualified Bidder, (ii) coordinate the efforts
of Qualified Bidders in conducting

----------
(*)  Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms shall have the
     meanings set forth in the Agreement.


<PAGE>

their respective due diligence investigations regarding the Company, (iii)
receive bids from Qualified Bidders, and (iv) negotiate any bid made to purchase
the Company (collectively, the "Bidding Process"). Any person who wishes to
participate in the Bidding Process must be a Qualified Bidder. Neither the
Seller nor its representatives shall be obligated to furnish any information of
any kind whatsoever relating to the Company to any person who is not a Qualified
Bidder.

                           PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

                  To participate in the Bidding Process, each interested person
(a "Potential Bidder") must deliver the following (unless previously delivered)
to Seller's Investment Banker (as defined below), with a copy to the Committees'
Financial Advisors (as defined below), no later than 12:00 noon (New York time)
on the third business day after entry of the order approving these Bidding
Procedures:

                     (i)  An executed confidentiality agreement in form and
                          substance satisfactory to the Seller, which is no less
                          favorable to the Seller than the confidentiality
                          agreement executed by the Purchaser; and

                     (ii) The most current audited and latest unaudited
                          financial statements (collectively, "Financials") of
                          the Potential Bidder, or, if the Potential
                          Bidder is an entity formed for the purpose of the
                          Transaction, (x) Financials of the equity holder(s) of
                          the Potential Bidder or such other form of financial
                          disclosure acceptable to the Seller and its advisors,
                          following consultation with the Committees and (y) the
                          written commitment of the equity holder(s) of the
                          Potential Bidder to be responsible for the Potential
                          Bidder's obligations in connection with the
                          Transaction.

                  A "Qualified Bidder" is a Potential Bidder that delivers the
documents described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, whose Financials
demonstrate the financial capability to consummate the Sale in the opinion of
the Seller after consultation with the Committees, and that the Seller
determines, after consultation with the Committees, is able to

                                       2



<PAGE>

consummate the Sale, if selected as the Successful Bidder. The Purchaser is a
Qualified Bidder.

                  Within two (2) business days after Seller's Investment Banker
receives from a Potential Bidder all of the materials required by subparagraphs
(i) and (ii) above, and after consultation with the Committees, the Seller shall
determine, and shall notify the Potential Bidder in writing (with a copy to
Purchaser), whether the Potential Bidder is a Qualified Bidder. At the same time
that the Seller notifies the Potential Bidder that it is a Qualified Bidder, the
Seller shall deliver (unless previously delivered) to the Qualified Bidder (i) a
confidential memorandum containing information and financial data relating to
the Company (the "Confidential Memorandum") and (ii) a copy of the Agreement.

                         OBTAINING DUE DILIGENCE ACCESS

                  To obtain due diligence access or additional information from
the Seller, a Qualified Bidder (other than Purchaser) must first provide the
Seller's Investment Banker (with a copy to the Committees' Financial Advisors)
with a written non-binding expression of interest ("Expression of Interest")
regarding (i) the Transaction, (ii) the purchase price range, (iii) the
structure and financing of the transaction (including the amount of equity to be
committed and sources of financing), (iv) any conditions to closing that it may
wish to impose, and (v) the nature and extent of additional due diligence it may
wish to conduct. If, based on the Expression of Interest and such additional
factors as the Seller determines (after consultation with the Committees) are
relevant, the Seller, in its business judgment, determines that the Qualified
Bidder is reasonably likely to make a bona fide higher or otherwise better offer
for the Company than offered by the Purchaser, the Seller shall afford such
Qualified Bidder reasonable due diligence.

                  Neither the Seller nor any of its affiliates (or any of their
respective representatives) are obligated to furnish any information relating to
the Company to any person except to Purchaser and a Qualified Bidder who makes
an acceptable Expression of Interest. Seller shall give Purchaser access to all
due diligence information provided to any other Qualified Bidder.

                  The Seller shall coordinate all reasonable requests for
additional information and due diligence access from Qualified Bidders. No
conditions relating to the completion of

                                       3


<PAGE>

due diligence shall be permitted to exist after the Bid Deadline (as defined
below).

                                  BID DEADLINE

                  THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING BIDS BY A QUALIFIED BIDDER SHALL
BE 12:00 NOON (NEW YORK TIME) ON [NOVEMBER 27], 2001 (THE "BID DEADLINE"). The
Seller, after consultation with the Committees, may extend the Bid Deadline once
or successively, but is not obligated to do so. If the Seller extends the Bid
Deadline, it shall promptly notify all Qualified Bidders of the extension.
Nothing in these Bidding Procedures will be deemed to amend Purchaser's rights
under the Agreement.

                  A Qualified Bidder that desires to make a bid shall deliver
written copies of its bid to (A) Lazard Freres & Co., LLC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza,
New York, New York, 10020, Attention: Blake O'Dowd, fax number (212) 332-1748

758-2628 (collectively the "Committees' Financial Advisors"), not later than the
Bid Deadline, who shall then distribute a copy of the bid to (i) the Sellers and
their other legal and financial advisors, (ii) counsel for the Committees, and
(iii) Purchaser and counsel for the Purchaser.

                           DUE DILIGENCE FROM BIDDERS

         Sellers' Financial Advisors and the Committees' Financial Advisors
shall be entitled to due diligence from the Qualified Bidder, upon execution of
a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably equivalent to the
confidentiality agreement executed by the Purchaser. The Qualified Bidder shall
comply with all reasonable requests for additional information and due diligence
access by the Sellers' Financial Advisors and the Committees' Financial
Advisors. Failure by the Qualified Bidder to fully comply with requests for
additional information and due diligence access will be a basis for Seller to
determine

                                       4


<PAGE>

that a subsequent bid made by the Qualified Bidder is not a Qualified Bid.

                                BID REQUIREMENTS

                  A bid must be a written irrevocable offer from a Qualified
Bidder (i) stating that the Qualified Bidder offers to consummate the
Transaction as contemplated by the Agreement, upon the terms and conditions
(other than the Termination Fee) set forth in a copy of the Agreement, marked to
show those amendments and modifications to the Agreement, including price and
terms, that the Qualified Bidder proposes (in form and substance acceptable to
Seller after consultation with the Committees, the "Marked Agreement"); (ii)
confirming that the offer shall remain open until the end of the first business
day following the earlier to occur of the closing under a Plan incorporating the
bid of a Successful Bidder (other than the Purchaser) and May 2, 2002; (iii)
enclosing a copy of the proposed Marked Agreement; and (iv) accompanied with (a)
a certified or bank check, or wire transfer, in the amount of Twenty Million
Dollars ($20,000,000.00) payable to the order of the Sellers as a good-faith
deposit (the "Good Faith Deposit"), and (b) written evidence of a commitment for
financing or other evidence of ability to consummate the transaction, subject to
no conditions other than those set forth in the Marked Agreement, in either
event satisfactory to Sellers in consultation with the Committees.

                  In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Sellers, after
consultation with the Committees, will consider a bid only if the bid:

                     a.   provides for an aggregate purchase price for the
                          Company of at least Ten Million Dollars
                          ($10,000,000.00) over the sum of (x) the aggregate
                          purchase price offered by Purchaser in the Agreement
                          (which shall be evaluated based, among other things,
                          on the cash purchase price, and working capital
                          adjustment and the assumption of liabilities set forth
                          in the Marked Agreement), and (y) the Termination Fee;

                     b.   provides that all cash and securities (other than
                          equity securities) which are components of the
                          purchase price are denominated in U.S. dollars only;


                                       5

<PAGE>

                     c.   is on terms that are not materially more burdensome
                          than the terms of the Agreement;

                     d.   is not conditioned on the outcome of unperformed due
                          diligence by the bidder with respect to the Company,
                          but may be subject to the accuracy in all material
                          respects at the Closing of specified representations
                          and warranties or the satisfaction in all material
                          respects at the Closing of that transaction of
                          specified conditions, none of which shall survive
                          Closing and none of which shall be materially more
                          burdensome than those set forth in the Agreement;

                     e.   does not request or entitle the bidder to any
                          Termination Fee, expense reimbursement or similar type
                          of payment; and

                     f.   fully discloses the identity of each entity that will
                          be bidding for the Company or otherwise participating
                          in connection with such bid, and the complete terms of
                          any such participation.

                  A bid received from a Qualified Bidder that meets the
requirements set forth in the preceding two paragraphs will be considered a
"Qualified Bid." For purposes hereof, the Agreement executed by the Purchaser
shall constitute a Qualified Bid, but under no circumstances will Purchaser be
required to make a Good Faith Deposit, nor will Purchaser be required to have
its offer, bid(s) or obligations under the Agreement remain open or otherwise
binding except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, notwithstanding any
provisions hereof, including provisions regarding the Next Highest Bid. Upon
receipt of a Qualified Bid, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with a copy
of the Qualified Bid and any Marked Agreement.

                    INCORPORATION OF SUCCESSFUL BID INTO PLAN

                  The terms of the Successful Bid shall be incorporated into the
Plan, which, together with the Disclosure Statement and the Explanatory
Statement, shall be amended to the extent required to give effect thereto. The
closing of the Sale shall be contingent upon confirmation of the Plan and the
occurrence of the effective date of the Plan. The Plan may provide that if the
Sale to the Successful Bidder does not close on or before April 30, 2002 (or, if
Purchaser is the Successful Bidder, such

                                       6


<PAGE>

other date as provided in the Agreement), the Seller may enter into a
Transaction with the bidder making the Next Highest Bid (as defined below),
without further notice or solicitation, provided that all conditions to the
closing of the Next Highest Bid in the Marked Agreement in connection therewith
are satisfied.

                                "AS IS, WHERE IS"

                  The Sale shall be on an "as is, where is" basis and without
representations or warranties of any kind, nature or description by the Sellers,
their agents or their estates, except to the extent expressly set forth in the
Agreement or the Marked Agreement, as the case may be.

                                     AUCTION

                  If Qualified Bids are received by the Bid Deadline, the Seller
will conduct an auction (the "Auction") with respect to the Transaction. THE
AUCTION SHALL TAKE PLACE AT 10:00 A.M. (NEW YORK TIME) ON [NOVEMBER 30], 2001 AT
THE OFFICES OF MILBANK, TWEED, HADLEY & MCCLOY LLP, 1 CHASE MANHATTAN PLAZA, NEW
YORK, NEW YORK 10005 or such later time or other place as the Sellers shall
notify all Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids. Only a Qualified
Bidder who has submitted a Qualified Bid will be eligible to participate at the
Auction. Only the authorized representatives of each of the Qualified Bidders,
the Committees, Purchaser and Sellers shall be permitted to attend the Auction.
At the Auction, Qualified Bidders will be permitted to increase their bids. The
bidding at the Auction shall start at the purchase price stated in the highest
or otherwise best Qualified Bid, as determined in the Sellers' sole discretion,
after consultation with the Committees, and as disclosed to all Qualified
Bidders prior to commencement of the Auction, and continue in increments of at
least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00).

                  Immediately prior to the conclusion of the Auction, the
Sellers, in consultation with their financial and legal advisors and the
Committees, shall (i) review each Qualified Bid on the basis of its financial
and contractual terms and the factors relevant to the sale process and the best
interests of the Sellers' estates, including, without limitation, those factors
affecting the speed and certainty of consummating the Sale, financing
contingencies, and antitrust and competition law considerations, (ii) identify
the highest or otherwise best offer for the Transaction (the "Successful Bid"),
and (iii)


                                       7


<PAGE>

identify the next highest or otherwise best offer after the Successful Bid (the
"Next Highest Bid").

                          ACCEPTANCE OF QUALIFIED BIDS

                  The Sellers presently intend to enter into a Transaction with
the Successful Bidder, whether such entity is the Purchaser or another Qualified
Bidder. Pursuant to the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding
Procedures (the "Bidding Procedures Order"), the Agreement shall constitute a
binding contract of Sellers only to the extent that performance is called for
before the closing under such agreement. The Sellers intend to present the
results of the Auction and the Agreement or the Marked Agreement, as the case
may be, to the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing (the "Approval Hearing"), at which
the Sellers will request that the Bankruptcy Court (i) confirm the results of
the Auction, including that the Auction complied with the Bidding Procedures and
the Bidding Procedures Order, and (ii) approve the selection of the Successful
Bid and the Successful Bidder, as the highest and best offer for the Business.

                    However, neither (a) the Sellers' inclusion of the
Successful Bid in the Plan, Disclosure Statement or Explanatory Statement, or
presentation of the Successful Bid and the Agreement or Marked Agreement, as
applicable, at an Approval Hearing, nor (b) the entry of an order approving the
Disclosure Statement or the Explanatory Statement (or any other order approving
the Agreement or the Marked Agreement before confirmation of the Plan) by the
applicable Court, shall obligate Seller to consummate the Transaction. The
Sellers will be obligated to consummate the Transaction and the Bankruptcy Court
and the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands each will have approved the
Transaction only when the Plan, as amended to give effect to the Successful Bid,
has been confirmed and the effective date thereof occurs. In the event that the
Successful Bidder fails to close the Agreement or the Marked Agreement, as the
case may be, with the Sellers for any reason, then the Sellers shall be
authorized, but not required, to close with the Qualified Bidder that submitted
the Next Highest Bid, following consultation with the Committees, without notice
to any other party or further court order; provided that Purchaser, if it
submitted the Next Highest Bid, shall have no obligation to close except as
expressly provided in the Agreement.

                                       8


<PAGE>

             RETURN OF GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT; QUALIFIED BIDS STAY OPEN

                  Pending the Closing, all Good Faith Deposits shall be
maintained by the Sellers in one or more interest-bearing escrow accounts. All
Qualified Bids (except any bids made by Purchaser) must remain open, until the
earlier to occur of (x) the Closing and (y) May 2, 2002. Pending such date, all
Good Faith Deposits shall be maintained by the Sellers in one or more
interest-bearing escrow accounts.

                                  MODIFICATIONS

                  The Sellers may, after consultation with the Committees, (a)
determine, in their business judgment, which Qualified Bid, if any, is the
Successful Bid and the Next Highest Bid; and (b) reject at any time before entry
of the Approval Order, any bid that, in the Sellers' sole discretion, is (i)
inadequate or insufficient, (ii) not in conformity with the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures, or the terms and conditions of Sale, or
(iii) contrary to the best interests of the Sellers and their estates. The
Sellers, after consultation with the Committees, shall have the right to adopt
such other rules for the Bidding Process which, in their sole judgment, will
better promote the goals of the Bidding Process and which are not inconsistent
with any of the provisions of these Bidding Procedures. At the Auction, after
consultation with the Committees, the Sellers may announce any such additional
procedural rules for conducting the Auction.
