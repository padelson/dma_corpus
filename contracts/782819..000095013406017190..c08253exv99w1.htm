       | (a)  |   | _Organization._ Goldcorp, each of the Goldcorp
Material Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of Goldcorp, each of the Goldcorp

Goldcorp, each of the Goldcorp Material Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of
Goldcorp, each of the Goldcorp Significant Interest Companies is registered,
licensed or otherwise qualified as an extra-provincial corporation or
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the nature of the business
or the location or character of the property and assets owned or leased by it
requires it to be so registered, licensed or otherwise qualified, other than
those jurisdictions where the failure to be so registered, licensed or
otherwise qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Goldcorp.
Except as disclosed by Goldcorp, all of the outstanding shares of the
Goldcorp Material Subsidiaries and the outstanding shares representing
Goldcorps interest in each of the Goldcorp Significant Interest Companies
are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable to the extent such a
concept exists under applicable law. All of the outstanding shares of the
Goldcorp Material Subsidiaries are owned directly or indirectly by Goldcorp.
Except pursuant to restrictions on transfer contained in the articles or by-

Subsidiary owned by Goldcorp or a Goldcorp Group Company which are owned by
Goldcorp are owned free and clear of all Encumbrances and neither Goldcorp
nor any of the Goldcorp Group Companies is liable to any Goldcorp Group
Company or to any creditor in respect thereof. There are no outstanding
options, rights, entitlements, understandings or commitments (contingent or

Glamis Significant Interest Companies or entering into any form of agreement,
arrangement or understanding) any inquiries or proposals regarding,
constituting or that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal;

    | (ii)  |   | participate, directly or indirectly, in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information or otherwise co-operate with, respond to, assist or participate
in, any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal;

or recommend, or propose publicly to agree to, approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until 15 calendar days following formal
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not be considered a violation
of this subsection 6.01(a)(iii));

       | (iv)  |   | make, or propose publicly to make a Change in
Glamis Recommendation;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (v)  |   | accept, enter into, or propose publicly to accept or

Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal;  
      
    | (vi)  |   | make any public announcement or take any other
action inconsistent with, or that could reasonably be likely to be regarded
as detracting from, the recommendation of the directors of Glamis to approve
the transactions contemplated herein,  
   

  

       |   |   | provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
preceding part of this subsection 6.01(a), but subject to the following
provisions of Article 6 of this Agreement, the directors of Glamis and on the
direction of any of the directors of Glamis, any officer, employee,
representative, agent or advisor of Glamis may, prior to the approval of the
Arrangement by Glamis Shareholders, consider or negotiate any unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal that may constitute a Superior Proposal, and
the directors of Glamis may make a Change in Glamis Recommendation in respect
of a Superior Proposal, or approve or recommend to the Glamis Shareholders or
enter into an agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal in accordance with
the provisions of the following subsections of this Article 6 but in each
case only if the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
Agreement by Glamis and if the directors of Glamis determine in good faith
after consulting with outside counsel (which may include written opinions or
advice) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of such directors under applicable Law.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Glamis shall, and shall cause the officers, directors,
employees, consultants, representatives and agents of Glamis and its
subsidiaries to, immediately terminate and cease any discussions or
negotiations with any parties (other than Goldcorp) with respect to any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to constitute, an
Acquisition Proposal. Glamis agrees not to release any third party from
any confidentiality agreement relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to
which such third party is a party. Glamis further agrees not to release any
third party from any standstill agreement or provision to which such third
party is a party. Glamis shall immediately request the return or destruction
of all information provided to any third party that, at any time since
December 31, 2004, has entered into a confidentiality agreement with Glamis
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to the extent that
such information has not previously been returned or destroyed, and shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are
honoured.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Promptly and, in any event, within 24 hours of the
receipt by any director or officer of Glamis of any Acquisition Proposal, or
any amendment to the foregoing, or any request for non-public information
relating to Glamis, any of the Glamis Subsidiaries or any of the Glamis
Significant Interest Companies in connection with any potential Acquisition
Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of Glamis or any
of the Glamis Subsidiaries or any of the Glamis Significant
Interest Companies by any person that informs Glamis, any of the Glamis
Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, Glamis shall notify Goldcorp thereof, at first orally and then, as
soon as possible thereafter, in writing. Such written notice shall include
the identity of the person(s) making such proposal and all material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and provide such other details of the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or contact as Goldcorp may
reasonably request.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If Glamis receives a request for material non-public
information from a person who is considering making or has made a written
Acquisition Proposal (the existence and content of which have been disclosed
to Goldcorp), and the directors of Glamis determine that such proposal could,
if consummated in accordance with its terms, reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal or does constitute a Superior Proposal and Glamis is
permitted, subject to and as contemplated under this section 6.01 then, and
only in such case, the directors of Glamis may, subject to the execution of a
confidentiality agreement on terms that are not more favourable to the ##### 

 

 

45  

       |   |   | making or considering making the Acquisition
Proposal than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and which
includes a standstill provision that restricts such person from acquiring, or
publicly announcing an intention to acquire, any securities or assets of
Glamis (other than pursuant to a Superior Proposal) for a period not
less than one year from the date of such agreement, provide such person with
access to information regarding Glamis; provided, however, that Glamis sends
a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Goldcorp immediately upon the
execution thereof and Goldcorp is provided with a list of or a copy of the
information, if any, provided to such person that was not previously provided
to Goldcorp and Goldcorp is immediately provided with access to similar
information.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Glamis shall ensure that its officers, directors,
consultants and employees and any financial advisors or other advisors or
representatives retained by Glamis are aware of the provisions of this
section 6.01, and Glamis shall be responsible for any breach of this section
6.01 by its financial advisors or other advisors or representatives.  
   

  

Section 6.02 Notice of Superior Proposal Determination 

   

       | (a)  |   | Glamis and the directors of Glamis shall not make
a Change of Glamis Recommendation or accept, approve, recommend or enter into
any agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement and a standstill agreement contemplated by
subsection 6.01(d) hereof) on the basis that it would constitute a Superior
Proposal, unless (i) Glamis has complied with its obligations under section
6.01 and the other provisions of this Article 6, (ii) such Superior Proposal
does not provide for the payment of any break, termination or other fees
or expenses to the other party in the event that Glamis completes the
Arrangement or any similar other transaction with Goldcorp or any of its
affiliates agreed prior to any termination of this Agreement, (iii) it has
provided Goldcorp with the information about such Acquisition Proposal as
required under subsection 6.01(c) that the directors of Glamis have
determined would be a Superior Proposal pursuant to subsection
6.01(a) hereof, and (iv) five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed from the
later of the date Goldcorp received notice of the determination of the
directors of Glamis to accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement
in respect of such Superior Proposal and the date Goldcorp received the
documents pursuant to subsection 6.01(c) hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | During the five Business Days referred to in subsection
6.02(a) hereof, Goldcorp shall have the opportunity, but not the obligation,
to offer in writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement.
The directors of Glamis shall review any offer by Goldcorp to amend the terms
of this Agreement and the Arrangement in order to determine in good faith, as
of the later of the dates referred to in subsection 6.02(a)(iv) hereof,
whether the offer of Goldcorp upon acceptance by Glamis would result in the
Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. If the directors of
Glamis so determine, Glamis shall enter into an amended agreement
with Goldcorp reflecting the amended proposal of Goldcorp and will promptly
reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement as amended.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Glamis acknowledges and agrees that each successive
modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of the requirement under subsection 6.02(a)(iv) hereof
and shall initiate an additional five Business Day period.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If the Proxy Circular has been sent to Glamis
Shareholders prior to the expiry of the five Business Day period set forth in
subsection 6.02(a) and, during such period, Goldcorp requests in writing that
the Glamis Meeting proceed, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, Glamis
shall continue to take all reasonable steps necessary to hold the Glamis
Meeting and to cause the Arrangement to be voted on at the Glamis Meeting.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Where at any time before the Glamis Meeting, Glamis has
provided Goldcorp with a notice under subsection 6.01(c), an Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly disclosed or announced, and the five  ##### 

 

 

46  

       |   |   | (5) Business Day period under subsection 6.02(a) has
not elapsed, then, subject to applicable Laws, at Goldcorps request, Glamis
will postpone or adjourn the Glamis Meeting at the Glamis Meeting (but not
beforehand without Goldcorps consent) to a date acceptable to Goldcorp,
acting reasonably, which shall not be later than twenty (20) days after the
scheduled date of the Glamis Meeting and shall, in the event that Goldcorp
and Glamis amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to subsection 6.02(b),
ensure that the details of such amended Agreement are communicated to the
Glamis Shareholders prior to the resumption of the adjourned
Glamis Meeting.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

Section 6.03 Break Fee Event 

   

       |   |   | In the event that (each of the events below being a
"Triggering Event"):  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (a)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp and Goldcorp
Subco pursuant to subsection 7.03(c) or (f) hereof;  
      
    | (b)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp and Goldcorp
Subco pursuant to subsection 7.03(b) hereof due to Glamis having breached its
obligations under subsections 6.01 or 6.02;  
      
    | (c)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Goldcorp and Goldcorp
Subco pursuant to subsection 7.03(b) hereof through the fault (whether by
commission or omission unless such commission or omission is ordered by the
Court) of Glamis failing to submit the Arrangement for approval to the Glamis
Shareholders, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on or prior to
the date that is five Business Days prior to the Completion Deadline or
failing to solicit proxies in accordance with subsection 4.01(b)(iii)
hereof;  
      
    | (d)  |   | an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Glamis
and made known to Glamis Shareholders generally or shall have been made
directly to Glamis Shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal in respect of Glamis
(a "Pending Glamis Acquisition Proposal") and such Pending Glamis Acquisition
Proposal or announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior
to the Glamis Meeting and, thereafter, the Glamis Shareholders do not approve
the Arrangement at the Glamis Meeting, this Agreement is terminated by either
Goldcorp or Glamis pursuant to subsection 7.03(d) or (e) hereof and
Glamis completes an Acquisition Proposal within 12 months following the
termination of this Agreement;  
      
    | (e)  |   | the Board of Directors of Glamis shall have made a
Change of Glamis Recommendation in respect of a Pending Glamis Acquisition
Proposal and, thereafter, the Glamis Shareholders do not approve the
Arrangement at the Glamis Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by either
Glamis or Goldcorp pursuant to subsection 7.03(d) hereof; or  
      
    | (f)  |   | this Agreement is terminated by Glamis pursuant to
subsection 7.03(g),  
   

 

then Glamis shall pay to Goldcorp in the circumstances set forth in
subsections 6.03(a), (b), (c) or (e) above, at the time of the termination of
this Agreement or within 30 days of such termination, and, in the
circumstances set forth in subsection 6.03(d) above, within five
days following the completion of such Acquisition Proposal, an amount in cash
equal to US$215,000,000 (the "Glamis Termination Payment"), in immediately
available funds. Glamis shall not be obligated to make more than one payment
pursuant to this section 6.03. Glamis hereby acknowledges that the Glamis
Termination Payment is a payment of liquidated damages which are a genuine
pre-estimate of the damages which Goldcorp will suffer or incur as a result
of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant non-completion of
the Arrangement and are not penalties. Glamis hereby irrevocably waives any
right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages
are excessive or punitive. Upon receipt of payment of the Glamis Termination
Payment by Goldcorp, Goldcorp shall have no further claim against Glamis in
respect of the failure to complete the Arrangement, provided that nothing
herein shall preclude Goldcorp from seeking injunctive relief to  ##### 

 

 

47   

restrain any breach or threatened breach by Glamis of any of its obligations
hereunder or otherwise to obtain specific performance without the necessity
of posting bond or security in connection therewith. 

   

ARTICLE 7 
 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 

   

Section 7.01 Amendment 

   

 This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time before or after the holding of the Glamis Meeting be amended by mutual written agreement of the parties hereto without, subject to applicable Law, further notice to or authorization on the part of the Glamis Shareholders and any such amendment may, without limitation: 

   

       | (a)  |   | change the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any of the parties hereto;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | waive any inaccuracies in or modify any representation
or warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;  
      
    | (c)  |   | waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants

obligations of any of the parties hereto; and  
      
    | (d)  |   | waive compliance with or modify any condition herein
contained,  
   

 

provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Share Exchange
Ratio shall not be amended without the approval of the Glamis Shareholders
given in the same manner as required for the approval of the Arrangement or
as may be ordered by the Court. This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement
may be amended in accordance with the Final Order, but in the event that the
terms of the Final Order require any such amendment, the rights of the
parties hereto under sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 6.03 and Article Seven hereof
shall remain unaffected. 

   

Section 7.02 Mutual Understanding Regarding Amendments 

   

       | (a)  |   | In addition to the transactions contemplated
hereby or at the request of a party hereto, the parties hereto will continue
from and after the date hereof and through and including the Effective Date
to use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to maximize
present and future planning opportunities for Glamis, the Glamis
Shareholders, the Glamis Subsidiaries, Goldcorp and the Goldcorp Material
Subsidiaries as and to the extent that the same shall not prejudice any
party hereto or the shareholders thereof. The parties hereto will ensure
that such planning activities do not impede the progress of the Arrangement
in any material way.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The parties hereto mutually agree that if a party
hereto proposes any other amendment or amendments to this Agreement or to the
Plan of Arrangement, Glamis on the one hand, and Goldcorp and Goldcorp Subco
on the other hand, will act reasonably in considering such amendment and if
the other of them and the shareholders thereof are not materially prejudiced
by reason of any such amendment they will co-operate in a reasonable fashion
with the party hereto proposing the amendment so that such amendment can be
effected subject to applicable Laws and the rights of the Glamis
Shareholders.  
      
    | (c)  |   | At any time prior to the Meeting: (i) Glamis and
Goldcorp shall each be entitled to propose to the other modifications to the
Arrangement in order to facilitate the tax or other planning objectives of
Glamis, Goldcorp and the Glamis Shareholders; and (ii) Glamis shall be
entitled to propose to Goldcorp modifications to the manner in which the
Glamis Options, Glamis Restricted Shares and Glamis SARS are to be dealt with
pursuant to this Agreement or under the Arrangement in order to take
into account the tax planning or other objectives of the holders of such
securities, provided, in each case that: (A) any such proposal is not likely
to materially prejudice the other party or the Glamis Shareholders, (B) would
not impede or materially delay the completion of the transactions  ##### 

 

 

48  

       |   |   | contemplated hereby, (C) the party making the
proposal has provided notice of such proposal to the other party not
less than 15 Business Days prior to the Meeting Date and (D) implementation
of the proposal would not result in a transaction that is inconsistent with
the fundamental terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
Share Exchange Ratio.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | Each of Glamis and Goldcorp agree that any such
modifications and any transactions or steps taken in accordance therewith
shall not be considered in determining whether any representation or warranty
made by them under this Agreement has been breached if such modifications,
transactions and steps are the sole cause of such breach.  
      
    |   |   | Glamis, Goldcorp and Goldcorp Subco shall enter into an
amending agreement reflecting the proposed amendments to the Arrangement and
this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall be modified accordingly and
Glamis and Goldcorp shall each use its respective commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate any such modifications to the Glamis Shareholders and
to ensure that any such modifications are, to the extent required under
applicable Law, presented to the Glamis Shareholders at the Meeting.  
   

  

Section 7.03 Termination 

   

       |   |   | This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Date:

    | (a)  |   | by the mutual written consent, duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of each of the parties hereto;

Glamis: (i) shall have made a Change in Glamis Recommendation, or (ii) except
as permitted under subsection 6.01(a)(iii), shall have failed, after being
requested by Goldcorp in writing, to reaffirm its approval or recommendation
of the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated herein as promptly as
possible (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after receipt of
such written request from Goldcorp, or (iii) shall have accepted, approved,
recommended or entered into an agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement that complies with subsection 6.01(d) hereof)) in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal;  
      
    | (d)  |   | by Goldcorp and Goldcorp Subco or by Glamis if the
Glamis Meeting shall have been held and completed and the Glamis Shareholder
Approval shall not have been obtained;  
      
    | (e)  |   | by either Goldcorp and Goldcorp Subco or Glamis if the
Arrangement shall not have been completed by the Completion Deadline provided
however, if the Arrangement has not been completed by such date because the
Glamis Meeting has not been held due to the fault of Glamis (the parties
acknowledging that Glamis is not at fault in the event that the Glamis
Meeting has not been held due to an order of a Governmental Entity), then
Glamis shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement;  
      
    | (f)  |   | by Goldcorp if the directors of Glamis shall have made
a Change in Glamis Recommendation;  
      
    | (g)  |   | by Glamis if Glamis proposes to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in compliance with sections
6.01 and 6.02 hereof, provided that Glamis has paid the Glamis Termination
Payment to Goldcorp;  
      
    | (h)  |   | by Goldcorp or Glamis at any time prior to September
13, 2006, if their confirmatory review results in the discovery of a material
fact which has not been disclosed by the other party and  ##### 

 

 

49  

     |   |   | which constitutes a Material Adverse Change or
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the other party.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

 

provided that any termination by a party hereto in accordance with paragraphs
(b) to (g) above shall be made by such party delivering written notice
thereof to the other party or parties hereto prior to the Effective Date and
specifying therein in reasonable detail the matter or matters giving rise to
such termination right. In the event of any such termination, subject to
the obligations of Glamis and Goldcorp contained in Article 6 hereof,
including the payment required by section 6.03 hereof, each party hereto
shall be deemed to have released, remised and forever discharged the other
parties hereto in respect of any and all claims arising in respect of
this Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein.

Section 8.02 Remedies 

   

 The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages may be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any party hereto or its representatives and advisors and that such breach may cause the non-breaching party hereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties hereto, Glamis (if either Goldcorp or Goldcorp Subco is the breaching party) or Goldcorp and Goldcorp Subco (if Glamis is the breaching party) will be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Subject to any other provision hereof including, without limitation, section 6.03 hereof, such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available hereunder or at law or in equity to each of the parties hereto. 

   

Section 8.03 Expenses 

   

 The parties hereto agree that all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Glamis Meeting, and the preparation and mailing of the Proxy Circular, including legal and accounting fees, printing costs, financial advisor fees and all disbursements by advisors, shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expense and that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to prevent the payment of such expenses. The provisions of this section 8.03 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

   

Section 8.04 Time of the Essence 

   

 Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement. 

   

Section 8.05 Entire Agreement 

   

 This Agreement, together with the agreements and other documents herein or therein referred to, constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no representations, warranties, covenants or conditions with respect to the subject matter hereof except as contained herein.  #####

Section 8.06 Further Assurances 

   

 Each party hereto shall, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, at the request of the other of them, but without further consideration, do, or cause to be done, all such other acts and execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such further agreements, transfers, assurances, instruments or documents as shall be reasonably required in order to fully perform and carry out the terms and intent hereof including, without limitation, the Plan of Arrangement. 

   

Section 8.07 Governing Law 

   

 This Agreement shall be governed by, and be construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein but the reference to such laws shall not, by conflict of laws rules or otherwise, require the application of the law of any jurisdiction other than the Province of Ontario. 

   

Section 8.08 Execution in Counterparts 

   

 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall conclusively be deemed to be an original and all such counterparts collectively shall be conclusively deemed to be one and the same. Delivery of an executed counterpart of the signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, and any party delivering an executed counterpart of the signature page to this Agreement by facsimile to any other party shall thereafter also promptly deliver a manually executed original counterpart of this Agreement to such other party, but the failure to deliver such manually executed original counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability or binding effect of this Agreement. 

   

Section 8.09 Waiver 

   

 No waiver or release by any party hereto shall be effective unless in writing and executed by the party granting such waiver or release and any waiver or release shall affect only the matter, and the occurrence thereof, specifically identified and shall not extend to any other matter or occurrence. Waivers may only be granted upon compliance with the provisions governing amendments set forth in section 7.01 hereof. 

   

Section 8.10 No Personal Liability 

   

       | (a)  |   | No director or officer of Glamis shall have any
personal liability whatsoever (other than in the case of fraud, negligence or
willful misconduct) to Goldcorp or Goldcorp Subco under this Agreement or any
other document delivered in connection with this Agreement or the Arrangement
by or on behalf of Glamis.  
---|---|---|---

shareholders under the _Business Corporations Act_ , by more than four months.
The record date must not precede the date on which the meeting is held by

Subject to the _Business Corporations Act_ , the directors may from time to
time declare and authorize payment of such dividends as they may deem
advisable. 

  

22.3 No Notice Required 

   

The directors need not give notice to any shareholder of any declaration under
Article 22.2. 

  

22.4 Record Date 

   

The directors may set a date as the record date for the purpose of determining
shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend. The record date must
not precede the date on which the dividend is to be paid by more than two
months. If no record date is set, the record date is 5 p.m. on the date on
which the directors pass the resolution declaring the dividend. 

  

22.5 Manner of Paying Dividend 

   

A resolution declaring a dividend may direct payment of the dividend wholly or
partly by the distribution of specific assets or of fully paid shares or of
bonds, debentures or other securities of the Company, or in any one or more
of those ways. 

  

22.6 Settlement of Difficulties 

   

If any difficulty arises in regard to a distribution under Article 22.5, the
directors may settle the difficulty as they deem advisable, and, in
particular, may: 

  

       | (1)  |   | set the value for distribution of specific
assets;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | determine that cash payments in substitution for all or
any part of the specific assets to which any shareholders are entitled may be
made to any shareholders on the basis of the value so fixed in order to
adjust the rights of all parties; and  
      
    | (3)  |   | vest any such specific assets in trustees for the
persons entitled to the dividend.  
   

  

22.7 When Dividend Payable 

   

Any dividend may be made payable on such date as is fixed by the directors. 

  

22.8 Dividends to be Paid in Accordance with Number of Shares

22.9 Receipt by Joint Shareholders 

   

If several persons are joint shareholders of any share, any one of them may
give an effective receipt for any dividend, bonus or other money payable in
respect of the share. 

  

22.10 Dividend Bears No Interest 

   

No dividend bears interest against the Company. 

  

22.11 Fractional Dividends 

   

If a dividend to which a shareholder is entitled includes a fraction of the
smallest monetary unit of the currency of the dividend, that fraction may be
disregarded in making payment of the dividend and that payment represents
full payment of the dividend. 

  

22.12 Payment of Dividends 

   

Any dividend or other distribution payable in cash in respect of shares may be
paid by cheque, made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent,
and mailed to the address of the shareholder, or in the case of joint
shareholders, to the address of the joint shareholder who is first named on
the central securities register, or to the person and to the address the
shareholder or joint shareholders may direct in writing. The mailing of such
cheque will, to the extent of the sum represented by the cheque (plus the
amount of the tax required by law to be deducted), discharge all liability
for the dividend unless such cheque is not paid on presentation or the amount
of tax so deducted is not paid to the appropriate taxing authority. 

  

22.13 Capitalization of Surplus 

   

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles, the directors may from
time to time capitalize any surplus of the Company and may from time to time
issue, as fully paid, shares or any bonds, debentures or other securities of
the Company as a dividend representing the surplus or any part of the
surplus. 

  

23\. DOCUMENTS, RECORDS AND REPORTS

properly the financial affairs and condition of the Company and to comply
with the _Business Corporations Act_.

ARTICLE 5 
 COVENANTS OF MANAGEMENT PARTIES 

   

     5.1  |   | Covenants of Management Parties regarding Business
Combination  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 In consideration of Goldcorp entering into the Arrangement Agreement and this Agreement, each Management Party agrees, in its capacity as a shareholder from Glamis, from and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement: 

  

       | (a)  |   | not to exercise any rights of dissent that may be
available to it under applicable Law in connection with the Business
Combination;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | to forthwith notify Goldcorp in writing upon the
acquisition of any additional Glamis Common Shares or Glamis Options other

    | (c)  |   | to take all reasonable action necessary to (i) permit
(a) such Partys Owned Securities to be acquired pursuant to the Business

if a director or officer of Glamis, from taking any action, from considering,
negotiating and authorizing an Acquisition Proposal in a manner consistent

Each Management Party hereby acknowledges that that it is aware that Glamis
has agreed in sections 6.01 and 6.02 of the Arrangement Agreement that Glamis
shall not except in certain enumerated circumstances, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, representative, advisor or agent
(which would include the Management  ##### 

 

 

\- 8 -   

Parties), make, solicit, initiate, facilitate, entertain, encourage or promote
any inquiries or proposals regarding, constituting or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition or change of control of Glamis or would or
could, in any case, result in the sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of Glamis and that any such action by a
Management Party contrary to section 6.01 or 6.02 of the
Arrangement Agreement would constitute a serious breach of the Arrangement
Agreement and may be in contravention of the Management Partys fiduciary
obligations to Glamis and Glamiss Shareholders.
