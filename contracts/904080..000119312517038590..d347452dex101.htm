Time. Subject to _Section 9.03(b)_ , from and after the occurrence of Closing,
Buyer shall be entitled to all of the rights of ownership (including the right

limiting Buyers rights to indemnity under _Section_ __ _ 12.04_, shall be
responsible for all Operating Expenses (other than overhead costs incurred by

28 ARTICLE III

 

CONSIDERATION

 

Section 3.01 _Purchase Price_. The consideration for (a) the purchase, sale
and assignment of the Assets by Seller to Buyer and (b) the assumption by
Buyer of the Assumed Obligations is $527,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"), as
adjusted pursuant to this Agreement (the "Adjusted Purchase Price"). The
Adjusted Purchase Price, less the Deposit, shall be paid by Buyer to Seller
at the Closing by means of a completed wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the account of Seller as designated by Seller to Buyer in writing
prior to the Closing.

 

Section 3.02 _Deposit; Remedies_.

 

(a) _Deposit_.

 

(i) On February 3, 2017, Buyer deposited by wire transfer in same day funds
with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") the sum of
$37,800,000 (such amount, including any interest earned thereon, the
"Deposit") and Buyer, Seller and Escrow Agent entered into that certain Escrow
Agreement dated February 3, 2017 (the "Escrow Agreement").

(ii) The Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall
be treated in accordance with _Section 9.05(b)_.

 

(b) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_ have been satisfied, (ii) Seller is ready, willing and
able to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) Buyer fails
to close as required hereunder and has no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, then Seller shall, as its sole and
exclusive remedy in such scenario, receive the Deposit from the Escrow Agent,
free of any claims by Buyer thereto as liquidated damages (and not as a
penalty) (in which event each Party shall, within five Business Days of the
date this Agreement is terminated, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the
Deposit to Seller). The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this
_Section 3.02(b)_ has been included because, in the event of a termination of
this Agreement described in this _Section 3.02(b)_ , the actual damages to be
incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of
liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

(c) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_ have been satisfied, (ii) Buyer is ready, willing and
able to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) Seller fails
to close as required hereunder and has no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, then Buyer shall have the right, at its
option:

 

(x) to seek specific performance by Seller (provided that if such specific
performance is not obtained Buyers exclusive remedies shall be, at its
option, the remedies in _Section 3.02(c)(y)_ or the remedies in _Section
3.02(c)(z)_ ), or

 

(y) to terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit from the Escrow Agent,
free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller (in which event each Party
shall, within five Business Days of the date that this Agreement is so
terminated, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer), and to
seek actual, direct damages from Seller up to an amount not to
exceed $36,000,000, or

(z) to terminate this Agreement and receive as liquidated damages (and not as
a penalty) and as its sole and exclusive remedy, the Deposit from the Escrow
Agent, free and clear of any claims thereon by Seller (in which event each
Party shall, within five Business Days of the date that this Agreement is
terminated, instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer). The
provision for payment of liquidated damages in this _Section_ __ _
3.02(c)(z)_ has been included because, in the event of a termination of this
Agreement described in this _Section 3.02(c)(z)_ , the actual damages to be
incurred by Buyer can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of
liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

 



29 (d) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than as set forth
in  _Section 3.02(b)_ , _Section 3.02(f)_ , _Section 3.02(i)(A)_ , _Section
11.01(b)_ (if the termination thereunder is as a result of a breach of this
Agreement by the Buyer such that the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _
8.01(a)_ and _8.01(b)_ are not able to be satisfied by Buyer by the Closing
Deadline), _Section 11.01(c)(i)_ or _Section 11.01(g)_ , then Buyer shall be
entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit, free and clear of any claims
by Seller with respect thereto. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller
pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_ , _Section 3.02(f)_ , _Section 3.02(i)(A)_ ,
_Section 11.01(b)_ (if the termination thereunder is as a result of a breach
of this Agreement by the Buyer such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.01(a)_ and _8.01(b)_ are not able to be satisfied by Buyer by the Closing
Deadline), _Section 11.01(c)(i)_ , or _Section 11.01(g)_ , then, as
liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) and Sellers sole and exclusive
remedy, Seller shall be entitled to retain the Deposit, free and clear of any
claims by Buyer with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, if this
Agreement is terminated (unless otherwise agreed) by both Seller and Buyer
pursuant to Section 11.01(a), then, as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy,
Buyer shall be entitled to the immediate return of the Deposit, free and clear
of any claims by Seller with respect thereto. Within five (5) days of a
termination of this Agreement as described in this _Section 3.02(d)_ , each
Party shall issue instructions to the Escrow Agent releasing the Deposit,
interest and any other amounts due to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, under
the Escrow Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall thereafter have the rights and
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.02_,
as applicable. The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this
_Section 3.02(d)_ has been included because, in the event of a termination of
this Agreement described in this _Section 3.02(d)_ , the actual damages to be
incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of
liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

 

(e) [ _Intentionally_ _Omitted._ ]

 

(f) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01(g)_ , then,
as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy, Seller shall be entitled to seek and
receive from

 



30  Buyer the full sum of the Deposit free of any claims by Buyer thereto as
liquidated damages (and not as a penalty), in which case, within five Business
Days of the date that this Agreement is terminated, (i) each Party shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the amount of the Deposit held
by Escrow Agent (such amount deposited pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)(i)_ ). The
provision for payment of liquidated damages in this _Section 3.02(f)_ has
been included because, in the event of a termination of this Agreement
described in this _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_, the actual damages to be incurred
by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of liquidated
damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such damages would
be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

 

(g) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ (and
the failure to Close as contemplated in _Section 11.01(b)_ is not caused by
or the result of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer such that the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(a)_ and _8.01(b)_ are not able to be
satisfied by Buyer by the Closing Deadline) or _Section 11.01(f)_ , then as
Buyers sole and exclusive remedy, Buyer shall receive, as liquidated damages
(and not as a penalty), the Deposit from the Escrow Agent, free and clear of
any claims thereon by Seller (in which event each Party shall, within five
Business Days of the date that this Agreement is terminated, instruct the
Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer). The provision for payment of
liquidated damages in this _Section 3.02(g)_ has been included because, in
the event of a termination of this Agreement described in this _Section
3.02(g)_ , the actual damages to be incurred by Buyer can reasonably be
expected to approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein
and because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not
impossible to measure accurately.

 

(h) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 11.01(d)(i)_ , then
Buyer shall receive, as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) and its
sole and exclusive remedy, the Deposit from the Escrow Agent, free and clear
of any claims thereon by Seller (in which event each Party shall, within five
Business Days of the date that this Agreement is terminated, instruct the
Escrow Agent to deliver the Deposit to Buyer). The provision for payment of
liquidated damages in this _Section 3.02(h)_ has been included because, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement described in this _Section 3.02(h)_
, the actual damages to be incurred by Buyer can reasonably be expected to
approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the
actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to
measure accurately.

(i) (A) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section
11.01(c)(ii)_ for failure by Buyer to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section 8.01(e)_ , then, Seller shall, as its sole and exclusive remedy,
receive the Deposit from the Escrow Agent, free of any claims by Buyer thereto
as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty); (B) if a material Proceeding
instituted by a securityholder of Seller or its Affiliates or a creditor of
Seller or its Affiliates, in each case in their capacity as such, results in a
termination of this Agreement (i) by Seller pursuant to
_Section 11.01(c)(ii)_ for failure by Buyer to satisfy the condition set
forth in _Section 8.01(c)_ , or (ii) by Buyer pursuant to _Section
11.01(d)(ii)_ for failure by Seller to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section 8.02(c)_ , then

 



31  Buyer shall receive, as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) and as its
sole and exclusive remedy, the Deposit from the Escrow Agent, free and clear
of any claims thereon by Seller; or (C) if this Agreement is terminated (x)
by Seller pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)(ii)_ or (y) by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 11.01(d)(ii)_ , in each case for any reason other than as set forth
in _Section 3.02(i)(A)_ or  _Section 3.02(i)(B)_ and to the extent none of
the other termination rights under _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ or _Section_ __ _
11.01_ apply, then Buyer shall be entitled to the immediate return of the
Deposit from the Escrow Agent, free and clear of any claims by Seller with
respect thereto, and Buyer and Seller shall thereafter have the rights and
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_. Within five (5) days of a
termination of this Agreement as described in this _Section 3.02(i)_ , each
Party shall issue instructions to the Escrow Agent releasing the Deposit,
interest and any other amounts due to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, under
the Escrow Agreement. The provisions for payment of liquidated damages in
this _Section 3.02(i)_ have been included because, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement described in this _Section 3.02(i)_ , the actual
damages to be incurred by Seller or by Buyer can reasonably be expected to
approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the
actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately.

 

Section 3.03 _Allocated Values_. Buyer and Seller agree that the unadjusted
Purchase Price is allocated among the Assets in the amounts set forth in
_Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _ 1_, _Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _ 2_,
_Exhibit A  Part 5_ and _Exhibit A  Part 6_. The "Allocated Value" for any
Asset equals the portion of the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such
Asset on _Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _ 1_, _Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _
2_, _Exhibit A  Part 5_ or _Exhibit A  Part 6_ and such Allocated Value
shall be used in calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided
herein. Buyer and Seller hereby agree that the Allocated Value for any Asset
shall be used solely for purposes of this Agreement and as set forth herein
and that such Allocated Value may not represent the fair market value
attributable to any Asset for any other purpose.

 

Section 3.04 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Purchase
Price and any other items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal
_i_ ncome Tax purposes among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and, to the extent allowed by applicable Law, in a manner consistent
with the Allocated Values, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Final Settlement Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03_. If the Parties
reach an agreement with respect to such allocation (as agreed, the
"Allocation"), (i) the Parties shall update the Allocation in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Seller and Buyer shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation
_o_ n all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset
Acquisition Statement under Section 1060), which Form will be timely
filed, if applicable, separately by Seller and Buyer with the Internal
Revenue Service pursuant to the requirements of Section 1060(b) of the Code),
and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position in any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable Law;
_provided,_ _however_ , that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in
its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax
audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such allocation.

Section 3.05 _[_ _ _Intentionally__ _ _ _ _Omitted__ _]_.

 



32 ARTICLE IV

 

TITLE MATTERS

 

Section 4.01 _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_.
Except as set forth in the Assignments and Deeds and without limiting Buyers
remedies under _Section 12.04(a)_ associated with a breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section 6.01(d)_, _Section 6.01(o)_ ,
_Section 6.01(q)_ , _Section 6.01(t)_ , _Section 6.01(aa)_ , _Section
6.01(bb)_ , _Section 6.01(dd)_ and/or _Section 6.01(ff)_ , Seller makes no
warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to Sellers title to any of the Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges
and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any
Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets shall be pursuant to the
Special Warranty of title set forth in the Assignments and Deeds, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.03_.

Section 4.02 _Special Warranty_. If the Closing occurs, then the Assignments
and the Deeds shall contain a special warranty of title effective as of the
Closing Date, whereby Seller shall warrant Defensible Title to the Leases, Fee
Minerals and Wells, against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming the same
or any part thereof by, through or under Seller or any of its Affiliates, but
not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances and the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ (such special warranty, the
"Special Warranty") _._

Section 4.03 _Recovery on Special Warranty_. From and after the Closing Date
up to the date that is the fifth anniversary date of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be entitled to furnish Seller written claim notices setting forth any
and all matters which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of Sellers Special
Warranty (collectively the "Special Warranty Notices" and individually a
"Special Warranty Notice"). To be effective, each Special Warranty Notice
shall be in writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged
breach of the Special Warranty and the Lease, Fee Mineral or Well (including
the description of such Well and the Leases or Fee Minerals applicable to such
Well as identified in Exhibit A  Part 1, Exhibit A  Part 2 or Exhibit A 
Part 6, as applicable), or portion thereof, affected thereby (each a "Special
Warranty Breach Property"), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Special Warranty
Breach Property (which may be the aggregate Allocated Values if more than one
Asset is subject to the same identical breach of the Special Warranty), (iii)
supporting documents (available to Buyer) or a sufficient description
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged breach
of the Special Warranty (including, if applicable, reference to documents in
Sellers Files or the identification of any document Buyer reasonably believes
is needed but missing from Sellers Files), and (iv) the Special Warranty
Breach Amount attributable to such alleged Breach of the Special Warranty and
the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. For the avoidance of
doubt, breaches of the Special Warranty may be based upon and supported
by documents, records and information contained in or missing from Sellers
Files. Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to
cure any breach of the Special Warranty asserted by Buyer pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.03_. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with any attempt
by Seller to cure any such breach but shall not be obligated to incur
any out-of-pocket costs or expenses in doing so. For purposes of the Special
Warranty, the value of the Leases, Wells and/or Fee Minerals set forth on 
_Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _ 1_, _Exhibit_ __ _ A  Part_ __ _ 2_ or
_Exhibit A  Part 6_, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value
thereof, as may be adjusted herein. Buyers recovery on the Special Warranty
shall be limited to the Allocated Value of such Well, Lease or Fee Mineral, as
may be adjusted herein.

 



33 Section 4.04 _Waiver of Title Defects  Pre-Closing_. WITHOUT LIMITING BUYERS
RIGHTS UNDER SELLERS SPECIAL WARRANTY (AS LIMITED BY _SECTION 4.03_ ), BUYER
WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM TITLE DEFECTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 4.05 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear,
in each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert such
matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a "Casualty Loss"), and
the Closing thereafter occurs, Seller, at Closing, shall pay to Buyer all sums
actually paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of any Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over
to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if
any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third
Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or against
any Seller Indemnitees) arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with
respect to the Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall reserve and
retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right, title, interest and
claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses
incurred prior to Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss and/or pursuing
or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties.

Section 4.06 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. With respect to each
Preferential Purchase Right set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 6.01(o)_, not later
than 2 Business Days after the Execution Date (and, with respect to each
Preferential Purchase Right that is not set forth in  _Schedule_ __ _
6.01(o)_ but is discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before
the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable after the discovery
thereof), Seller shall send to the holder of each such Preferential Purchase
Right a notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

 

(a) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies or the time for exercising a
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase
Right has not been exercised or waived, then the Asset subject to
such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be
assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such
Asset affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded. In such event, Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any
Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right prior to the Closing. If such
holder of such Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the
purchase of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential

 



34  Purchase Right in accordance with the terms thereof, the time for exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right has expired and such Preferential Purchase
Right has not been exercised, or if the Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or
before 10 Business Days following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or
portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer
at Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to the
amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such
excluded Asset (or portion thereof), and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the
Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment or Deed, as applicable.

 

(b) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired (and such Preferential Purchase Right has not been
exercised), in each case, prior to the Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.07 _Consents to Assign_. With respect to each Consent set forth in
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.01(d)_, Seller, not later than 2 Business Days after the
Execution Date (and, with respect to each Consent that is not set forth in
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.01(d)_ but is discovered by either Party after the
Execution Date and before the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the discovery thereof), shall send to the holder of each such Consent a
notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such Consent seeking such holders consent to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(a) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in  _Schedule_ __ _
6.01(d)_ (or any Consent that is not set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 6.01(d)_
but is discovered by either Party after the Execution Date and before the
Closing Date) prior to the Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent
would cause (or give the lessor or grantor the right to cause) (1) the
assignment of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable, or
(2) the termination of or the right to terminate a Lease, Fee Mineral,
Contract or right-of-way under the express terms thereof or (B) a Consent
requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case, the Asset
(or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be excluded
from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded. In the event that any such Consent (with respect to an Asset
excluded pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_) that was not obtained
prior to the Closing Date is obtained within 120 days following the Closing
Date, then, within 10 Business Days after such Consent is obtained, (x) Buyer
shall purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result
of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which
the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset
(or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment or Deed, as applicable.

(b) If Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule_ __ _
6.01(d)_ (or any Consent that is not set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 6.01(d)_
but is discovered by either Party after the

 



35  Execution Date and before the Closing Date) prior to the Closing and (A) the
failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (or give the lessor or grantor
the right to cause) (1) the assignment of the Asset (or portion thereof)
affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable, or (2) the termination of or
the right to terminate a Lease, Fee Mineral, Contract or right-of-way under
the express terms thereof and (B) such Consent requested by Seller is not
denied in writing by the holder thereof, then the Asset (or portion thereof)
subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller
to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets and Buyer shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such
Consent.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, with reasonable assistance from Buyer, to obtain all Consents listed

58 Section 9.03 _Final Settlement Statement; Supplemental Closing_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare within 120 days after the Closing Date and furnish to
Buyer a final settlement statement setting forth (i) the Purchase Price, and
(ii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price and pro-rating of any amounts
provided for in this _Article_ __ _ IX_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
(the "Final Settlement Statement"). Seller shall supply, together with its
delivery of the Final Settlement Statement, reasonable documentation in the
possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates to support the items for which
adjustments are proposed or made in the Final Settlement Statement and a brief
explanation of any such adjustments and the reasons therefor. Buyer shall
within 30 days after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement have the right,
but not the obligation, to deliver to Seller a written report (together with
reasonable supporting documentation) containing any changes that Buyer
proposes be made to such Final Settlement Statement (the "Dispute Notice").
Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived and
Sellers determinations (as contained in the Final Settlement Statement) with
respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not
addressed specifically in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to
timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to
be made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by
the Parties, and will be final and binding on the Parties (except with respect
to Asset Taxes) and not subject to further audit or arbitration. The Parties
shall undertake to agree on the final adjustment amounts and such final
adjustment amounts shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, not later
than five Business Days after such agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.03(a)_ or resolution pursuant to _Section 9.03(c)_. Subject to  _Section
9.03(b)_ , the occurrence of the Closing shall not relieve either Party of its
obligation to account to the other Party after the Closing with respect to
amounts that are received or become due after the Closing and that are
properly payable or chargeable to either Party pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement. If Seller fails to timely furnish to Buyer the Final
Settlement Statement in accordance with this _Section 9.03(a)_ within 120 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to prepare and deliver the
Final Settlement Statement within 30 days after the end of such period to
Seller, in which case the provisions of this _Section 9.03(a)_ (other than
this sentence) shall apply _mutatis_   _mutandis_ to the Parties, with the
reference "Seller" contained therein to be construed to mean Buyer and the
reference "Buyer" contained therein to be construed to mean Seller.

 

(b) From and after the agreement by the Parties of the Final Settlement
Statement, each Party shall continue to account to the other Party with
respect to proceeds, Operating Expenses and capital expenditures in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ until the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
following which date, but without limiting the Parties rights to the
indemnities set forth in _Article XII_ , there shall be no adjustment for, or
obligation to pay or account for, any proceeds, Operating Expenses or capital
expenditures between the Parties.

 



59 (c) If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in
the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall, within 15 Business Days
after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard
to such dispute in a written document of twenty pages or less and submit such
summaries to the Houston office of KPMG LLP, or such other party as the
Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the
Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation
such Party may desire to submit. Within 30 Business Days after receiving the
Parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a
decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to
each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described
above. Without limiting the application of _Section 14.01(c)_ or Buyers right
to indemnity under _Section 12.04(b)_ for Seller Taxes, any decision rendered
by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Seller and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the Parties
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne pro rata between the Parties with each
Party being responsible for the Accounting Arbitrators costs and expenses to
the extent the Accounting Arbitrator has not selected such Partys position on
an aggregate dollar basis with respect to all amounts submitted for
resolution by the Accounting Arbitrator.

including:

(a) all obligations (whether arising by Law or by contract) to properly plug

(other than with respect to those representations and warranties set forth in

its own behalf and on behalf of the other Seller Indemnitees) waives,
releases and forever discharges Buyer from any and all Liabilities under
_Section 12.02(a)_ in excess of this aggregate amount.

or warranty has been breached, with respect to all such Liabilities for a
breach of any representations and warranties for which indemnity is provided
under _Section_ __ _ 12.02_ or  _Section_ __ _ 12.04_ only, the references
to materiality qualifications (or correlative terms) contained in such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

through (xi) of the Designated Liabilities definition) shall become Assumed
Obligations, in each case, following expiration of the indemnities for such

their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect, consequential, punitive,
exemplary, remote or speculative damages, or damages for lost profits or loss
of business opportunity of any kind, arising under or in

 



69  connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
except to the extent any such party suffers such damages (including costs of
defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending
of such damages) to a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against
such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, Buyer, on behalf of each of the
Buyer Indemnitees, and Seller, on behalf of each of the Seller Indemnitees,
waive any right to recover special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, or damages for lost
profits or loss of business opportunity of any kind, arising in connection
with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

Section 12.11 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
this _Article_ __ _ XII_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Indemnitor" when used
in connection with particular damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such damages
pursuant to this Agreement, and the term "Indemnitee" when used in connection
with particular damages shall mean a Person having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such damages pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) To make claim for indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ XII_, an
Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of its claim, including the specific
details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim
Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a
claim by a Third Party against the Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnitee shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnitee has
actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all
papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that
the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice of a Third Party Claim as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 12.11_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of
its obligations under this _Article_ __ _ XII_ except to the extent (and
only to the extent of such incremental damages incurred) such failure results
in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnitor to effectively
defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnitors
ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to
notify the Indemnitee whether or not it agrees to indemnify and defend the
Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim under this _Article_ __ _ XII_. The
Indemnitee is authorized, prior to and during such 30 day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnitor and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnitor.

 



70 (d) If the Indemnitor agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee, it shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the
Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof, subject to the
terms hereof. If requested by the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee agrees to
cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnitor elects to
contest ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee shall not be required
to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnitee may participate in, but not control, at its sole cost and expense,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnitor pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.11_. An Indemnitor shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnitee, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not
result in a final resolution of the Indemnitees Liability with respect to the
Third Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional
written release of the Indemnitee from all Liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnitee (other
than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(e) If the Indemnitor does not agree to indemnify the Indemnitee within the 30
day period specified in  _Section_ __ _ 12.11(c)_ or fails to give notice to
the Indemnitee within such 30 day period regarding its election or if the
Indemnitor agrees to indemnify, but fails to diligently defend or settle the
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend against
the Third Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, if the
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the
Indemnitees choosing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnitee shall
make no settlement, compromise, admission or acknowledgment that would give
rise to Liability on the part of any Indemnitor without the prior written
consent of such Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the damages complained of, (ii) agree to indemnify the
Indemnitee for such damages, or (iii) dispute the claim for such damages. If
such Indemnitor does not respond to such Claim Notice within such 30 day
period, such Indemnitor will be deemed to dispute the claim for damages.

 

Section 12.12 _Escrow Claims_. If the Indemnity Escrow Amount deposited into
escrow at Closing was greater than zero dollars ($0.00), but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 10.06_ (if applicable):

(a) Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this _Article XII_ ,
any amounts due by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this _Article XII_ will be
first satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Amount. To the extent that Buyer is
determined to be owed by Seller amounts in excess of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, Buyer may seek payment for such amounts from Seller.

(b) In the event that any Buyer Indemnitee becomes entitled to any
distribution from Seller pursuant to this _Article XII_ , Buyer and Seller
shall execute joint

 



71  instruction letters to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to disburse to Buyer the amount of the undisputed claim out of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 

(c) On the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date that is 12
months after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to Seller the then existing amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, save and except the aggregate amount of all unsatisfied claims for
indemnification that Buyer has made against Seller on or before such date
pursuant to this _Article XII_ and which are subject to satisfaction (in whole
or in part) from the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 12.12(a)_.

 

Section 12.13 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree that
any indemnity payments made pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ XII_ shall be
treated for all U.S. federal and applicable state income Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

ARTICLE XIV

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 14.01 _Allocation of Asset Taxes_.

 

(a) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be
allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax period
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of determining the allocations described in _Section
14.01(a)_ , (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause
(iii) below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance or
production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that
are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause (i)_ or _(iii)_ ),
shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to such
Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or
other Asset Taxes, including the Pennsylvania impact fee, imposed on a
periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the
portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by
prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period that occur before the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
on the one hand, and the number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on
or after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For
purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the period for such Asset
Taxes assessed under West Virginia law shall begin on January 1 of each
calendar year and shall end on December 31 of each calendar year. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of such Asset Taxes assessed or assessable
under West Virginia Law on July 1, 2015 for the 2016 tax year that are
allocable to the Seller shall be based on the number of days the Assets were
owned from January 1, 2016, to the day before the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, and the amount of such Asset Taxes that are allocable to the
Buyer shall be based on the number of days the Assets were owned from the date
on which the Effective Time occurs to December 31, 2016.

(c) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, as applicable, the Parties
shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount
of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual
amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a
Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that
was taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.03_, timely payments will be made from one Party
to the other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount
of such Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section_ __ _
14.01_.

 



74 Section 14.02 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall bear and pay all sales, use,
transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, excise or similar Taxes incurred
or imposed with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement
("Transfer Taxes") and Buyer shall pay all required filing and recording fees
and expenses in connection with the filing and recording of the assignments,
conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to
Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize,
to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such
Transfer Taxes. Seller shall include a provision in the Plan, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of such
provision, providing for an exemption for the sale and transfer of the Assets
from any Transfer Taxes to the maximum extent legally permissible under
section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

Section 14.03 _Cooperation_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information
that are relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a

mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided under this Agreement.

Section 14.04 _Like-Kind Exchange_. Buyer and Seller agree that either or
both of Seller and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Assets as an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an
"Exchange"),  _provided_ that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of
the Exchange. Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange
subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1
and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a
part of its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that
term is defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an
exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Partys rights under
this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any other person in
connection with the Exchange shall release any Party from, or modify, any of
its liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each
other) under this Agreement, and no Party makes any representations as to any
particular Tax treatment that may be afforded to any other Party by reason of
such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the 

 



75  Exchange. Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets
as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred
hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the
cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall
agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Party, its Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Partys Exchange election.

 

Section 14.05 _Post-Closing Taxes_. Subject to Buyers indemnification rights
under _Article XII_ of this Agreement, after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
responsible for payment to the applicable Governmental Authority of all Asset
Taxes relating to any Tax period that ends before or includes the Effective
Time that become due and payable after the Closing Date, and shall file with
the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all Tax Returns required to be
filed after the Closing Date with respect to such Asset Taxes.

 

Section 14.06 _Section 754 Election_. Seller shall, prior to the Closing, (i)
cause each tax partnership that is scheduled with respect to _Section
6.01(i)(iv)_ to either (x) have in effect a valid election under Section 754
of the Code for any taxable year that includes the Closing Date or (y) obtain
all necessary consents therefor; and (ii) provide evidence satisfactory to
Buyer that the covenant set forth in clause (i) has been satisfied.

ARTICLE XV

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 15.01 _Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals_. As soon
as reasonably possible after the Closing, but in no event later than 90 days
after such Closing, Buyer shall remove the names of Seller and its Affiliates,
including "Stone" and all variations thereof, from the Assets. Promptly after
Closing, Buyer shall make all requisite filings with, and provide the
requisite notices to, the appropriate Governmental Authorities to accomplish
all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 15.02 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the documents to be executed pursuant hereto and the Annex,
Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement between
the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. No
supplement, amendment, alteration, modification, waiver or termination of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Parties and
specifically referencing this Agreement as being supplemented, amended,
altered, modified, waived or terminated.

Section 15.03 _Waiver_. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
or rights hereunder shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provisions hereof or right hereunder (whether or not similar), nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No
course of dealing on the part of any Party or their respective officers,
employees, agents, or representatives, nor any failure by a Party to exercise
any of its

 



76  rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or affect in
any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the performance of
