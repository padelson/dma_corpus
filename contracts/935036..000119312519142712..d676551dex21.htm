Seller or Sellers Accountants shall have delivered within 30 days after the
date on which the Adjustment Report is delivered to Seller, a written notice
to Buyer stating each and every item to which Seller takes exception,
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of any such exception

remains disputed, then Buyer and Seller shall engage PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or unavailable, another
independent firm of public accountants of nationally recognized standing
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") to
resolve any remaining disputes. The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator
to determine, based solely on presentations by Buyer and Seller, and not by
independent review, only those issues still in dispute with respect to the
Adjustment Amount. The decision of the Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding and shall be in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
4.5_. All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by
Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the disputed
items resolved by the Accounting Firm, utilizing the values of such items as
initially submitted by the parties to the Accounting Firm. Such proportional
allocations shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time its
determination is rendered on the disputed items.

 

(c) Any Adjustment Amount shall be paid within five business days following
the Adjustment Report Finalization Date as follows:

(i) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount equals the Adjustment Amount, no
payment shall be made;

calculated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_, Seller shall pay to
Buyer the difference thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified in writing to Seller by Buyer; and

 

(iii) if the Adjustment Amount, as calculated in accordance with this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_, exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall pay
to Seller the difference thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts specified in writing to Buyer by Seller.

 

Any payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_ shall
be made together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of
payment at the rate of interest per annum equal to the 30-day LIBOR in effect
on the Closing Date as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_.

records or information relating to any Consolidated Tax Group; and _provided_
, _further_ , Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller,
contact or communicate with any vendor, customer, employee, independent
contractor or other business partner of the Companies with respect to or in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such investigation shall be
conducted in a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of
the Companies or Seller and Buyer shall not undertake any invasive or
intrusive environmental testing without Sellers prior consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ shall be subject to the right of Seller to determine, in
its discretion, the appropriate timing of the disclosure of information it
deems proprietary commercial information or privileged information. The
parties shall act at all times in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.2. _Notifications_. From the date hereof to the Closing Date,
each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other of any action, suit
or proceeding of which they are aware that shall be instituted or threatened
against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality
of any Contemplated Transaction. Prior to Closing, each party hereto shall
promptly notify the other of any lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation
that may be threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Companies,
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, that would have been listed in
_Schedule_ __ _ 5.12_ or _Schedule_ __ _ 6.3_, as the case may be, if such
lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date
hereof. If a party fails to notify the other party under this _Section_ __ _
7.2_, a failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ shall not cause the
failure of any condition set forth in  _Article_ __ _ IX_ or _X_ to be
satisfied unless the underlying change, event or development would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article_ __ _
IX_ or _X_ to be satisfied.

Section 7.3. _Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals_ _; Shared
Contracts_. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to secure, as promptly as
practicable, the consent, approval or waiver required to be obtained from any
party to any Transferred Contract or other Business Agreement to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, such action
shall not include any requirement of Seller or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates (including the Companies) to expend money (other than
customary legal advisor costs), commence or participate in any Proceeding or
offer or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any
third party.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall act diligently and reasonably, and
Seller, upon the request of Buyer, shall act diligently and reasonably in
cooperating with Buyer, in attempting to secure any consents and approvals of
any Governmental Body required to be obtained by Buyer in order to permit the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(c) Parent, Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) file not more than ten business days after the date hereof
with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notifications and other
information required to be filed under the HSR Act. Each of Parent, Buyer and
Seller agrees to file (and to cause its Affiliates to file) any additional
information requested by such Governmental Bodies under the HSR Act or any
other competition Laws as promptly as practicable after receipt of such
request. Each of Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, shall furnish to the other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR
Act or other competition Law, as the case may be. Each of Seller, on the one
hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use reasonable best
efforts to comply promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional
information from the FTC and the DOJ. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in

 this Agreement (including the following sentence), prior to Closing, each of
the parties agrees to (and to cause its Affiliates to) use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable, consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, to
consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Contemplated
Transactions. In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Parent and Buyer agrees to (and to cause its
Affiliates to) use reasonable best efforts to take any and all
actions necessary to obtain all consents and approvals of any antitrust
Governmental Bodies, including but not limited to: (i) causing the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and
obtaining all other necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and
approvals from all Governmental Bodies and making all necessary registrations
and filings (including filings with Governmental Bodies) and taking all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body, (ii) defending any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of the Contemplated
Transactions, including opposing any motion or action for a temporary,
preliminary or permanent injunction against the Contemplated Transactions and
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered into by any
court or other Governmental Body vacated or reversed, and (iii) promptly
taking all steps and making all undertakings to secure antitrust clearance;
provided, however, that the foregoing covenants do not require Parent or
Buyer to propose, negotiate, offer to commit to enter into or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, sell, offer to sell or
otherwise dispose of, properties of Parent, Buyer, their respective Affiliates
and/or the Companies or hold separate such properties pending such sale or
other disposition. Prior to Closing, each of the parties agrees to (and to
cause its Affiliates to) keep the other party informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Body
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party relating to the Contemplated Transactions, in
each case regarding any of the Contemplated Transactions. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, prior to Closing, each
of the parties shall permit the other party to review in advance any material
communication delivered to, and to the extent practicable consult with the
other party in advance of any substantive meeting or discussion with, any
Governmental Body relating to the Contemplated Transactions or in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, and give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and discussions (to the
extent practicable and permitted by such Governmental Body or private party).
No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any
Governmental Body without the consent of the other party to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the parties shall mutually agree to
the strategy, manner and process relating to seeking the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, including, if applicable,
to pull and refile thereunder or to extend the period for any action.

 

(d) Buyer acknowledges that certain consents (including consents contingent
on the fulfillment of certain conditions), approvals, waivers, agreement, or
actions of, or (with or without lapse of time) notice to, third parties
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required
under instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements or arrangements (the "
_Applicable Consents_ "), which Applicable Consents may have not been obtained
or are themselves subject to conditions not fulfilled as of the Closing. Other
than (if 

 



49

    

 applicable) with respect to claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _
12.2(a)(i)_ in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(i)(A)(2)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.20(a)(ii)_, Seller shall
not have any liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Applicable Consents except to use efforts as herein
provided. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(i)_, if an Applicable Consent is not
obtained in respect of a Seller Licensed Subsidiary Contract prior to the
expiration of the applicable term of the Transition Services Agreement, such
Contract shall nevertheless be assigned to one of the Companies in accordance
with this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement, and the Companies
and Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating
to or arising out of such Seller Licensed Subsidiary Contract (including any
breaches thereof) and shall indemnify Seller and its Subsidiaries from any
losses relating thereto.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the Seller Licensed Subsidiary and/or the
Companies are parties to certain Seller Licensed Subsidiary Contracts. Prior
to Closing, the Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to with respect to the Seller Licensed
Subsidiary Contracts set forth on applicable subsections of  _Schedule_ __ _
7.3(e)(i)_, (1) obtain the consent of such Biller to remove the Seller
Licensed Subsidiary as a party to such Contract, (2) assign the rights and
obligations of the Seller Licensed Subsidiary under such Contract effective
as of the Closing to the Buyer Licensed Subsidiary and obtain the consent of
such Biller to such assignment, or (3) assign the rights and obligations of
the Seller Licensed Subsidiary under such Contract in respect of retail money
transfer services to the Buyer Licensed Subsidiary effective as of the Closing
and obtain the agreement of the applicable Biller that is the counterparty to
such Contract to enter into a new contract effective as of the Closing Date
pursuant to which the Seller Licensed Subsidiary will receive substantially
the same goods and services provided by such Contract to the Seller Licensed
Subsidiary prior to the Closing in respect of the walk-in services
contemplated thereby and to remove such walk-in services from such Seller
Licensed Subsidiary Contract.

 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the Companies are parties to certain
Biller Contracts (other than the Contracts set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
7.3(e)_) pursuant to which (A) the Companies provide services in respect of
the Business and (B) Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Companies),
provide services relating to the businesses of Seller other than the Business
(the " _Joint Service Contracts_ "). Prior to the Closing, the parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the agreement of the Biller that is the counterparty to each Joint
Service Contract to enter into (1) a new replacement contract effective as of
the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as practicable pursuant to which the
Companies will provide the services to such Biller that the Companies
provided under the applicable Joint Service Contract and (2) a new replacement
contract effective as of the Closing Date pursuant to which Seller or its
applicable Subsidiary will provide the services to such Biller that Seller or
its applicable Subsidiary (other than the Companies) provided to such Biller
under the Joint Service Contract.

(g) The parties acknowledge that the Companies are parties to certain
Contracts that relate to the operations or conduct of the business of Seller
and its Affiliates (excluding the Companies) and the Business, but will remain
with Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Companies) after the Closing. In
the case of those contracts set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.3(e)(ii)_ (the "
_Shared Contracts_ "), prior to Closing, the parties shall cooperate with 

 



50

    

 each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to (A) obtain
the agreement of the third party that is the counterparty to each Shared
Contract to enter into a new contract effective as of the Closing Date
pursuant to which the Companies will receive substantially the same goods and
services provided by the Shared Contract to the Companies, or Seller or its
Subsidiaries in respect of the Business, prior to the Closing (each, a "
_Replacement Shared Contract_ ") and, where applicable, to cause the
applicable counterparty to release the Seller and its applicable Affiliates
(excluding, prior to Closing, the Companies) from any applicable
minimum quantity or other commitments to the extent such commitments become
the obligation of the Companies under the Replacement Shared Contract and (B)
to the extent either of the Companies is a party to a Shared Contract, cause
the applicable counterparty to release the applicable Company from
obligations arising after the Closing Date under the Shared Contract effective
as of the Closing Date.

 

(h) If one or more Replacement Shared Contracts are not entered into prior
to or on the Closing Date, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing,
during the remaining term of the applicable Shared Contract, the parties shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to allow the Companies to the
extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law to receive substantially
the same goods and services of the subject matter of the Shared Contract
received prior to the Closing and the economic and other burdens of such
Shared Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall reimburse the
Seller for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with any such arrangement and, subject to the requirements of the
Transition Services Agreement, the Seller shall have no obligation to engage
in the Business following the Closing. Nothing in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_,
_7.3(f)_ , _7.3(g)_ or _7.3(h)_ shall require Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Companies) to expend money (other than customary
legal advisor costs), commence or participate in any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third
party.

 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the transactions contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_ shall occur until the applicable Biller is an
Eligible Biller. In the event that any Biller does not become an Eligible
Biller prior to the expiration of the applicable service under the Transition
Services Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to terminate
such Biller Contract and the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates in
respect of such Biller Contract in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ shall terminate.
Buyer will be responsible for any liability to a Biller arising from a claim
that such termination was a breach of the Biller Contract.

(j) Seller and the Buyer will each designate a qualified employee to serve
as its principal representative to coordinate and facilitate the transactions
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, _7.3(f)_ , _7.3(g)_ and _7.3(h)_.
Such employees designated will be granted sufficient authority to resolve on
behalf of Seller and the Buyer all questions and problems arising with respect
to the transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, _7.3(f)_ ,
_7.3(g)_ and  _7.3(h)_. From the date hereof until further written notice to
the other party, unless changed by the relevant Party by notice given in
accordance with this Agreement the representative of Seller shall be John
Jones, and the representative of the Buyer shall be Rob Osborne. Such
representatives shall discuss any issues regarding the transactions
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, _7.3(f)_ , _7.3(g)_ and _7.3(h)_ at
least twice per week during the first four weeks following the date hereof
and weekly thereafter. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, all
communications relating to this Agreement will be made in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 13.3_. In the event that such representatives are not able

 



51

    

 to resolve any issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, _7.3(f)_ , _7.3(g)_ and
_7.3(h)_ , the applicable issues shall be escalated to Sanjay Gupta, on
behalf of Buyer, and Caleb Kim, on behalf of Seller, or other senior
management team members mutually agreed by the parties, who shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve any such issues or disputes.

(k) From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, none of Seller,
Buyer, nor any of their respective Affiliates, will enter into any agreement
or effect a transaction that would reasonably be expected to delay obtaining
any antitrust approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(l) Subject to the services to be provided by Seller and its Affiliates
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, and cause its Affiliates to take, any and all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after Closing Buyer and its Affiliates have
any and all money transfer licenses and similar permits necessary to operate
the Business from and after Closing.

(m) Seller and Buyer will cooperate and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to convert each Biller of the Business to NextGen Platform as
promptly as reasonably practical; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(m)_ shall not require Seller or its Subsidiaries to
expend any funds or make any concessions other than those customarily made by
Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the NextGen Platform migration
and (ii) the obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(m)_ shall terminate as
of the Closing.

(n) Nothing in  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_ through
_7.3(h)_ shall include any requirement of Seller or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates (including the Companies) to expend money (other
than customary legal advisor costs), commence or participate in any
Proceeding or offer or grant any concession (financial or otherwise) to any
third party.

 

(o) The parties acknowledge and agree that Buyers obligation to obtain the
Financing is governed by _Sections 7.6_ and _7.7_ and not this _Section_ __ _
7.3_.

Section 7.4. _Operations Prior to the Closing Date_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
7.4_, requested by any Governmental Body, required or expressly permitted by

Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companies
to operate and carry on the Business in all material respect in the ordinary
course and substantially as operated immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement and to use their commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
goodwill of the suppliers, contractors, licensors, employees, customers,

change any Tax method of accounting, file any amended Tax Return, settle or

its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter
and negotiate in good faith and enter into as promptly as practicable
definitive agreements (the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") with

in the Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions of the related fee
letter), _provided_ that such terms do not contain any conditions to funding
that are not set forth in the Commitment

 



55

    

 Letter and otherwise would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or
delay the Closing); (ii) comply on a timely basis with all covenants, and
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions, required to be complied with or
satisfied by Parent in the Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions
of the related fee letter) and in such Definitive Financing Agreements; (iii)
cause the Financing to be consummated at such time or from time to time as is
necessary for Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement; (iv) pay
in a timely manner any and all commitment or other fees that become payable by
Buyer or Parent under the Commitment Letter on or following the date hereof;
and (v) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive

funding contained in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied, Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders under the Commitment
Letters to fund the Financing on the date the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ (without giving effect to the first proviso
therein). Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller,
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter or the

consummate the Contemplated Transactions or make the satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur. Parent shall not
release or consent to the termination of the obligations of any of the parties
under the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements.

 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter (including the
"flex" provisions of the related fee letter) for any reason or the Commitment
Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner adverse to Seller for any
reason, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than three business days prior to the
date the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1_, from
the same or alternative financing sources, alternative financing on terms not
less favorable (including, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) all conditions
precedent and contingencies to funding of such financing being in the
aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding, equivalent to (or
more favorable to Parent than) the conditions precedent and contingencies set
forth in the Commitment Letter (prior to such Alternative Financing) and (2)
such substitution not (x) delaying or preventing the Closing, (y)
adversely impacting the likelihood of the funding of the Financing or (z)
adversely impacting the ability of Parent or Buyer to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing
Agreements or the ability of Parent or Buyer to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) to Parent than the terms of the Financing in
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into consideration
the funds otherwise available to Parent), and (ii) the amount of financing
that was contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the date hereof. In the
event any alternative or substitute financing is obtained by Parent in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ (the " _Alternative
Financing_ "), references herein to the Financing (including, for avoidance of
doubt, the references in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, but excluding references
in

 



56

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_) shall be deemed to refer to the Alternative
Financing, and if a new financing commitment letter is entered into in
connection with such Alternative Financing, references herein to the
Commitment Letter (including, for avoidance of doubt, the references in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_, but excluding the references in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_)
shall be deemed to refer to the new financing commitment letter entered into
in connection with the Alternative Financing and any references to the fee
letters shall refer to the new fee letters entered into in connection with the
Alternative Financing.

 

(c) Parent and Buyer each acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the
Financing is not a condition to its obligations to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

(d) Buyer shall promptly (i) reimburse Seller for all
documented reasonable third-party out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by Seller or any of its
Affiliates in connection with their cooperation with Buyer in its efforts to
obtain the Financing and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Companies and

Seller, neither Parent nor Buyer shall amend, waive or otherwise modify any
provision in the Representation and Warranty Policy attached hereto as Exhibit

in such RandW Policy, the insurer thereunder or any other Person to subrogate or
otherwise make or bring, or cause Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates to
make or bring, any claim or Proceeding against Seller or any Affiliate
thereof or any past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee or

is 30 days after the date of this Agreement by providing written notice to
Seller (an " _Exercise Notice_ ") of such exercise. Subject to  _Section_ __
_ 7.13(c)_, any exercise of the Walletron Option by Buyer shall create an
irrevocable and binding obligation of Buyer and Seller to consummate the
acquisition of the Walletron Shares concurrently with the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer may rescind its
exercise of the Walletron Option and the Exercise Notice if, and only if, in
the 30-day period following the date of the Exercise Notice a material and
adverse event occurs with respect to Walletron and Buyer delivers notice of
option termination in writing to Seller prior to the expiration of such
30-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may only acquire the
Walletron Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ concurrently with the
Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, any
prior exercise of the Walletron Option shall be cancelled and of no further
force or effect.

 

(d) If the Walletron Option has been properly exercised and not rescinded
or terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.13(c)_, at the Closing
Seller shall assign and transfer to Buyer all of its right, title and interest
in and to the Walletron Shares to Buyer and Buyer shall pay the Walletron

manner and promptly upon the reasonable request of such other party;

 

(iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or
disputes with Taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Companies
(and, if the Walletron Option has been properly exercised and not rescinded or
terminated, in each case, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.13_,
Walletron);

 

(iv) make available to the other and to any Taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Companies (and, if the Walletron Option has been properly exercised and not
rescinded or terminated, in each case, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.13_, Walletron); and

 

(v) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request.

(e) _Tax Indemnity_. (i) Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision hereof, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify
Buyer, Parent and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents
representatives and Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies
and, in the event the Walletron Option is exercised, Walletron) and hold each
of them harmless against (A) any Taxes of the Companies for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable period
that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
any Taxes allocable (pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)(vii_)) to the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (in each case to the
extent not otherwise included in the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital, as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5_), (B) Sellers share
of the Transfer Taxes, if any, as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, (C)
any Liability of the Companies for the payment of the Taxes of another Person
(1) arising as a result of being (or ceasing to be) a member of a Consolidated
Tax Group 

 



66

    

 (or being included (or requiring to be included)) in any Tax Return relating
thereto, (2) under any Contract entered into prior to the Closing Date (other
than any Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business and not
primarily relating Taxes), or (3) as a result of being a transferee or
successor under applicable Law in a transaction consummated prior to the
Closing Date and (D) Excluded Taxes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Tax indemnity provided under this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ shall
not cover Tax Liabilities resulting from any action taken after the Closing on
the Closing Date by Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates that is outside the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement. (ii) Without limiting the generality or effect
of any other provision hereof, from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify Seller and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives and Affiliates and hold each of them harmless against all
Taxes (A) of the Companies properly allocable to a Tax period or portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date, (B) Buyers share of the Transfer
Taxes, if any, as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, and (C) described in
clauses (B) and (C) of the definition of Assumed Taxes. (iii) Payment by
the indemnifying party of any amount due under this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_
shall be made within 10 Business Days following written notice by the
Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
authority is due; _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than five Business Days before it is due
to the appropriate Taxing authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ below, payment of
the Tax to the appropriate Taxing authority shall not be considered to be due
earlier than the date a final determination to such effect is made by the
appropriate Taxing authority or court. (iv) The parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. (v) Any disputes between the parties
with respect to the Tax matters regarding the Companies in _Section_ __ _
8.2_ shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, whose fees and expenses shall
be borne in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_. (vi) For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) with respect to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date (A) in the case of any real or
personal property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes and similar periodic Taxes, by
multiplying the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (B) in the case of all
other Taxes, by way of a closing of books, as though the relevant taxable
period had ended on the Closing Date ( _provided_ that exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction
for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily basis). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any deductions attributable to Transaction Expenses that have not
been reflected on a Seller Tax Return shall, insofar as permissible, be
allocated to the taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date. (vii)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller and Buyer agree that
Seller makes no representation, warranty, and provides no other assurance,
with respect to the amount of any Tax Attributes of the Companies, or with
respect to the availability on and after the Closing Date of any Tax
Attributes of the Companies.

(f) _Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_. (i) If a Tax claim,
audit, examination, notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination shall be made or threatened against Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, or any of their Affiliates by any Taxing authority, which, if
successful, would result in an indemnity payment pursuant to

 



67

    

  _Section 8.2(e)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the indemnified party shall promptly
notify the indemnifying party in writing of such Tax Claim stating the nature
and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known by
the indemnified party. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable period of time to allow the
indemnifying party to effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise the indemnifying party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in
each case taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect to such
Tax Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
indemnified party or any of their Affiliates if, and to the extent that, the
indemnified partys ability to effectively contest such Tax Claim is actually
prejudiced as a result thereof. (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim that
relates to a Tax for which Seller would be solely responsible pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)(i)_, Seller shall control at its expense all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel), but shall not, without the prior written approval of Buyer (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree or
consent to compromise or settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of a Proceeding, any issue or claim arising in such Proceeding,
or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax Liability, to the extent that any
such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement may directly increase (A)
the Tax Liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any Company)
or (B) the Tax Liability of any Company with respect to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) for which Buyer would be responsible pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.2(e)(ii)_. (iii) With respect to any Tax Claim for which Buyer would be
solely responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)(ii)_, Buyer shall have
the right to control at its expense all proceedings taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel), but shall not, without the
prior written approval of Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of a Proceeding, any issue
or claim arising in such Proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax
Liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement may directly increase (A) the Tax Liability of Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than any Company) or (B) the Tax Liability of any
Company with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for which
Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)(i)_. (iv) With
regard to a Tax Claim that is (A) related to any Company with regard to a
Straddle Period and (B) would be described in _Sections 8.2(e)(i)_ or _(ii)_ ,
but for not being the sole responsibility of either Seller or Buyer, Seller
and Buyer shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in
connection with any such Tax Claim, and shall bear their own respective costs
and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , neither Seller nor Buyer shall agree or
consent to compromise or settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of a Proceeding, any issue or claim arising in such Proceeding,
or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax Liability, without the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). (v) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
resolution of any Tax Claims for which Buyer or Seller would be responsible
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ (including by the provision of reasonably
relevant records or information). The party requesting such cooperation shall
pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the other party.

(g) _338(h)(10) Election_. Seller shall join with Buyer in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election
under state, local, and foreign Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of
all issued and outstanding shares of the Companies hereunder (collectively,
the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_"). In furtherance of the

 



68

    

 preceding sentence, Buyer shall complete, execute and timely file with the
appropriate Taxing authority any such forms provided by Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(h)_ and Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer any
other documents or forms as Buyer shall reasonably request or as are required
by Law to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election, in each case, as reasonably
prepared by Buyer. Seller shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction, or
other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on its Tax
Returns to the extent required by Law, and shall take no position inconsistent
with treating the purchase by Buyer of all issued and outstanding shares of
the Companies as a transaction to which Section 338(h)(10) applies unless
required by Law. The consideration paid for all issued and outstanding shares
of the Companies hereunder and the Liabilities (to the extent included in
amount realized for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) of the Companies shall
be allocated among the assets of the Companies in accordance with Section 338
of the Code and their fair market values as shown on an allocation schedule
provided by Buyer and approved, or deemed approved, by Seller (the "
_Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Within 90 days after the Adjustment Report
Finalization Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a draft Purchase Price
Allocation. If within 30 days after Sellers receipt of the draft Purchase
Price Allocation, Seller has not objected in writing to such draft Purchase
Price Allocation, it shall become final. In the event that Seller objects in
writing within such 30-day period, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve the dispute. Any issues with respect to the Purchase Price
Allocation which have not been finally resolved within 30 days
following Sellers provision of an objection pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.2(g)_ shall be referred to the Accounting Firm, whose determination shall be
final and binding upon the parties. To the extent that the Purchase Price
is adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ or other provision of this
Agreement, the parties shall amend the Purchase Price Allocation to reflect
such adjustments and each of Buyer and Seller shall file an amended IRS Form
8883 (Asset Allocation Statement Under Section 338) as required. Buyer,
Seller and each of their Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with such Purchase Price Allocation (as it may be amended pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_), and none of the parties will voluntarily
take any position inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation in any
audit, inquiry, assessment, Proceeding or other similar event relating to Tax.

 

Section 8.3. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, except as set forth on _Schedule_ __ _
8.3(a)_, (i) the employment of each U.S. Business Employee not then employed
by a Company, along with all Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates
attributable to each such Business Employee (other than Liability under any
Employee Benefit Plan to the extent not otherwise addressed in _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_, _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(i)_ , or _(j)_ , and, with respect to
current liabilities, only to the extent reflected in Closing Date Working
Capital) shall be transferred to one of the Companies and (ii) Buyer or one
of its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall offer employment to each
International Business Employee, effective as of the Closing, with terms and
conditions of employment substantially similar in the aggregate to those
provided by Seller prior to the Closing, including with respect to
compensation and benefits and any other material terms, as required by
applicable Law. Effective as of the Closing, each International Business
Employee shall cease to be employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates, as
applicable. Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely liable for any Liability
(i) to any Business Employee that occurs by reason of a change in control
of either Company or the Contemplated Transactions, including the
Reorganization, (ii) to any International Business Employee, for all accrued
vacation time with

 



69

    

 respect to employment periods through the Closing Date, (iii) for all claims
under welfare benefit plans or retirement plans (other than with respect to
rollover contributions and transferred accounts contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 8.3(h)_ and _(j)_ , respectively) with respect to employment periods
through the Closing Date, and (iv) for any severance or similar costs incurred
by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the termination of employment
of any International Business Employee except to the extent caused by Buyers
failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing (or such later date mandated by Laws), each
Affected Employee shall cease to be eligible to participate in the Employee
Benefit Plans and any other employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates or to accrue benefits thereunder with respect
to services performed after the Closing.

 

(c) In addition to complying with all Laws regarding amount, types and
changes in compensation, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending no earlier than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
take all commercially reasonable action necessary so that each Affected
Employee receives (i) base wages, salaries, bonuses, commission arrangements
and incentive compensation (which may be in the form of cash or equity
incentives) at rates and with values substantially comparable in the aggregate
to the rates and values of wages, salaries, bonuses, commission arrangements
and incentive compensation (including cash and equity incentives) received by
the Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either (a) the
employee benefits provided to the Affected Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date or (b) the employee benefits provided as of the date hereof by
Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or
substantially similar benefits) (the arrangements under which such employee
benefits are provided, the " _Buyer s Benefits Programs_"). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, provide severance benefits to any Affected Employee who experiences a
termination of employment (including anyone whose employment terminates in
connection with a proposed relocation of more than 35 miles) (excluding solely
as a result of the Contemplated Transactions) during the one-year period
beginning immediately after the Closing in an amount that is at least equal to
the severance benefits that would have been paid to such employee pursuant to
the layoff or severance arrangements maintained by Seller and its Affiliates
and applicable to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, calculated on the basis of the Affected Employees compensation and
service at the time of the termination of employment. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer agrees not to engage in any "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined in WARN) for 90 days after the Closing
Date.

 

(d) Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to credit Affected Employees
with all service credited to such Affected Employees by the Companies, Seller
and their respective Affiliates as of the Closing in addition to service
earned with Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing for all purposes
(including purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits, such as
the amount of any vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits
under Buyers Benefit Programs, and shall provide that Affected Employees may
commence participation in Buyers Benefit Programs immediately following the
Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, waive any pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, actively
at work requirements or waiting periods for participation and coverage
applicable under Buyers Benefit Programs with respect to Affected Employees
and

 



70

    

 their dependents. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, credit
Affected Employees with any amounts paid under any of the Employee Benefit
Plans prior to the Closing for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, coinsurance or out-of-pocket requirements for the plan year that
includes the Closing Date as if such amounts had been paid under
a corresponding Buyers Benefit Program.

(e) With respect to each U.S. Business Employee who is an
Affected Employee, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide,
recognize and honor the accrued but unused paid time off (" _PTO_ ") and any
accrued sick leave hours under the Western Union Company Transition Sick Leave
Policy  U.S. Only as of the Closing Date to the extent reflected in Closing
Date Working Capital. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than the
Companies) shall have any Liability after the Closing for such PTO or accrued
sick leave to the extent reflected in Closing Date Working Capital.

(f) Without limiting the comparability requirement described in 
_paragraph_ __ _ (c)_ above, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates, to pay bonuses to Affected Employees who were U.S. Business
Employees with respect to the year in which Closing occurs that, in the
aggregate, are not less than the amount of bonus accruals reflected in
Closing Date Working Capital. Seller will pay all bonuses to Affected
Employees with respect to 2018 except to the extent such payment amounts are
reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital. 

(g) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, establish or maintain a
healthcare flexible spending account program and a dependent care flexible
spending account program for each Affected Employee who is a U.S. Business
Employee and who, in the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing
Date, contributed to the healthcare flexible spending account program or
dependent care flexible spending account program, as applicable, maintained by
Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Seller FSA Program_ "). The beginning balance
as of the Closing Date in each of Buyers healthcare spending account program
and dependent care flexible spending account program, as applicable, shall be
the unused portion of the balance in the applicable healthcare spending
account program and dependent care flexible spending account
program maintained by Seller or its Affiliates. Buyer shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by such Affected
Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have
not been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid
pursuant to and under the terms of Buyers flexible spending account programs.
If the aggregate amount withheld from such Affected Employees compensation
under the Seller FSA Program for the year in which the Closing occurs exceeds
the aggregate amount of reimbursements paid to such Affected Employees prior
to the Closing Date under the Seller FSA Program for such plan year, Seller
shall transfer (or cause to be transferred) to Buyer within 30 days after the
Closing Date a cash payment equal to such excess, if any (which amount shall
not be included in Closing Date Working Capital). If the aggregate amount of
reimbursements paid to such Affected Employees under the Seller FSA
Program prior to the Closing Date for the year in which the Closing occurs
exceeds the aggregate amount withheld prior to the Closing Date from such
Affected Employees compensation under the Seller FSA Program for such plan
year, Buyer shall transfer to Seller within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date a cash payment equal to such excess, if any (which amount shall
not be included in Closing Date Working Capital). Buyer and Seller intend that
the actions to be taken pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(g)_ be treated
as an assumption by Buyer of the portion of the Seller FSA Program and the
elections made thereunder attributable to such Affected Employees consistent
with Revenue Ruling 2002-32.

 



71

    

(h) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to
maintain, establish or designate a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
(the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") in which the Affected Employees who are U.S.
Business Employees are eligible to participate. Buyer shall cause the Buyer
401(k) Plan to accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) elected
by any such Affected Employee from any tax-qualified Employee Benefit Plan
(including any loan notes) in which such Continuing Employee participated
prior to the Closing.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Companies shall make any and all
payments to the Affected Employees relating to all amounts that would be
considered earned under the Employee Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule
8.3(h) (the " _Business Plans_ ") as of the Closing.

 

(j) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall assume the Liabilities under
the SISP attributable to the Affected Employees and shall administer such
Liabilities and make associated payments to Affected Employees in accordance
with the terms of the SISP and all elections thereunder.

 

(k) After the Closing Date, Buyer, its Affiliates and the Companies shall
have the Liability for, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any liability or obligation for, short-term disability benefits, sick pay
or salary continuation (and any medical dental and health benefits or claims
incurred after the Closing Date) for the Affected Employees for periods after
the Closing Date. Seller shall have the Liability therefor in respect of all
pre-Closing periods. For purposes of this paragraph, a medical, dental or
other claim shall be deemed incurred when the treatment for which the
Affected Employee (or a dependent thereof) is entitled to a benefit is
performed or undertaken, as applicable.

 

(l) Seller has provided an accurate and complete list as of the date hereof
of each Business Employee who experienced an "employment loss" (as defined in
WARN) during the 90 days prior to the date hereof, stating for each such
employee the date of Employment Loss, the employees position and work
location. Provided that the aforementioned list is accurate and complete,
Buyer agrees that it shall have all Liabilities with respect to any "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined in WARN) triggered by its actions with
respect to the Business Employees after the Closing Date. Seller shall have
all Liabilities with respect to any mass layoff or plant closing triggered by
its actions prior to the Closing Date, and all such Liabilities arising after
the Closing Date to the extent that they are the result of inaccuracies or
omissions in the aforementioned list of employment losses.

(m) Regardless of anything else contained herein, the parties do not
intend for this Agreement to amend any plans or arrangements or create any
rights or obligations except between the parties. No Affected Employee or
other current or former employee of the Companies, including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof, or any other person not a party to this Agreement, shall
be entitled to assert any claim hereunder. Nothing herein expressed or implied
shall confer upon any of the Affected Employees or any other person any right
to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature
or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



72

    

Section 8.4. _Securities Law Legends_. Buyer agrees and understands that
the Shares have not been, and shall not be, registered under the Securities
Act or the securities Laws of any state and that the Shares may be sold or
disposed of only in one or more transactions registered under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities Laws or as to which an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities Laws is available. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no person has
any right to require Seller to cause the registration of any of the Shares.
The certificates representing the Shares may contain a legend similar to the
following and other legends necessary or appropriate under applicable state
securities Laws:

 

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE " _ACT_ ") OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF UNLESS A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS WITH RESPECT
TO SUCH SHARES IS EFFECTIVE OR UNLESS THE COMPANY IS IN RECEIPT OF AN OPINION
OF COUNSEL SATISFACTORY TO IT TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH SHARES MAY BE SOLD
WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT AND SUCH LAWS.

 

Section 8.5. _Insurance; Risk of Loss_. Seller shall, and shall cause the
Companies to, keep insurance policies or self-insured retentions currently
maintained for the benefit of the Companies covering their business, assets
and current or former employees and the Contributed Assets, as the case may be
(the " _Insurance Coverage_ "), or suitable replacements therefor, in full
force and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date. From and
prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to take such actions as may be
reasonably necessary not to voluntarily relinquish or terminate policies
providing Insurance Coverage if doing so would adversely affect the
availability of such Insurance Coverage. The availability of Insurance
Coverage with respect to any claim shall be subject in all respects to
Sellers applicable deductibles, retention and similar limits. From and after
the Closing Date, the Companies shall be solely responsible for all insurance
coverage and related risk of loss based on claims pending as of the
Closing Date and claims made after the Closing Date, without regard to when
the event giving rise to any such claim occurred, with respect to the
Companies and their business, assets and current or former employees.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, Seller and Buyer agree
that all claims with respect to insured events relating to the Business
occurring prior to the Closing will be administered in all material respects
in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Coverage. Seller will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer with the benefit of the Insurance
Coverage with respect to such claims to the extent Losses occurring prior to
the Closing related to the Business are covered notwithstanding the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ that (a) such
recovery will be net of any deductibles or self-insured retention amounts,
costs of any retroactive insurance premiums or other amounts paid or expenses
incurred in connection with any insured claims made after the Closing under
the Insurance Coverage and (b) Seller shall have no obligation to Buyer or any
Company hereunder to prioritize Company

 



73

    

 claims over other claims of Seller or any of its Affiliates. In the event of
any failure by any insurer to satisfy any claim, Seller and its Affiliates
shall have no liability or obligation to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 8.5_; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude any liability of
Seller for any breach by Seller of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_. To the extent
that after the Closing any party hereto requires any information regarding
claim data, payroll or other information relating to the Companies in order to
make filings with insurance carriers or regulators from another party hereto,
such other party shall promptly supply such information. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to expend
money (other than customary legal advisor costs), commence or participate in
any Proceeding or offer or grant any accommodation or concession (financial or
otherwise) to any third party.

 

Section 8.6. _Substitute Guaranties; Replacement Letters of Credit_. At or
prior to Closing, Buyer shall (a) make Buyer or one of its Affiliates
substituted for Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies) in
those guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or similar arrangements
entered into by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 8.6(a)_ (the " _Guaranties_ "), (b) cooperate in
Sellers efforts to make Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies)
fully released from all of its obligations under the Guaranties (including if
necessary, by replacing collateral for such obligations of Seller and its
Affiliates and upon receipt, if any, of any cash or collateral deposits,
returning such to Seller) and (c) provide for replacement letters of credit
for the letters of credit included in the Guaranties; _provided_ , _however_ ,
if Buyer fails to take such actions prior to Closing, Buyer shall take such
actions, as promptly as possible, and effective as promptly practicable,
following the Closing. If Buyer is unable to effect such a substitution and
release with respect to any Guaranties after using reasonable best efforts to
do so, Buyer shall indemnify Seller from any Losses arising from such
Guaranties. Without limiting the foregoing, after the Closing, Buyer will not,
and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, renew, extend, amend or
supplement any loan, contract, lease or other obligation that is covered by
a Guaranty without providing Seller with evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Seller that Sellers Guaranty has been released.

 

Section 8.7. _Assistance with Financial Reporting_. For a period of six
years after the Closing, Buyer shall provide reasonable assistance to Seller
during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice in connection
with any reporting obligations of Seller pursuant to the Securities Act or
Exchange Act or any of the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder and
any other financial reporting obligations of Seller, in each case, related to
the Business or the Companies during any period prior to the Closing.

 

Section 8.8. _Non-Competition;  Non-Solicitation; No-Hire_.

 

(a) Seller hereby agrees that Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, for a period of two years after the Closing Date, engage
in, control or manage any business that engages in the Business (whether
utilizing the Sprint Platform or any other platform). Nothing herein shall
prohibit Seller and its Subsidiaries from (i) being a passive owner of not
more than 5% of the outstanding stock of any class of an entity which is
publicly traded, so long as such Person has no active participation in the
business of such corporation, (ii) engaging in any business activities (other
than the Business) that were conducted by Seller and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date or the one year period preceding the

 



74

    

 Closing Date in the ordinary course and in accordance with its past
practices, (iii) acquiring an ownership interest in any Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if 10% or more of the gross revenues of such Person are
attributable to a Business, Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
divest such Business within 12 months of such acquisition or (iv) providing
any Seller Service the primary purpose of which is for the collection of
payments by a United States customer from outside of the United States, but
which may include the incidental or occasional collection and transmission of
US dollar payments within the United States for such customer.

 

(b) Seller hereby agrees that Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, for a period of one year after the Closing Date, (i)
solicit any Affected Employee to leave the employ of the Companies or (ii)
hire any Affected Employee. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the foregoing shall not be deemed breached by and shall not prevent
Seller and its Subsidiaries from, (A) undertaking general solicitations of
employment not specifically targeted at any of the foregoing employees or (B)
soliciting or hiring any of the foregoing employees from and after the date

force or effect, (i) with respect to any business or Subsidiary of Seller that
is disposed of to a Person or Persons who are not controlled by Seller or (ii)
with respect to Seller and its Subsidiaries if Seller is involved in a
Business Combination. " _Business Combination_ " means any transaction or
series of transactions (A) pursuant to which any Person or group of Persons
acquires beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the outstanding voting power
of Seller or 50% or all or substantially all of the assets of Seller and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or (B) in the form of a merger,
reorganization, combination or other structure, as a result of which, the
stockholders of Seller immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own
less than 50% of the surviving or resulting Person from such transaction.

 

Section 8.9. _On-Going Actions_. During the period between the
date hereof and the Closing, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts
to take the actions contemplated in Sections 1.7 through 1.10 of Schedule A of
the Transition Services Agreement as though the Transition Services Agreement
were in effect as of the date hereof and without the use of the service
contemplated in Schedule B of the Transaction Services Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that such actions may not be completed prior to Closing
and following Closing, the Transition Services Agreement, and not this
Agreement, shall govern the actions to be taken under Section Sections 1.7
through 1.10 of Schedule A of Schedule A of the Transition Services
Agreement).

required to be completed.

 

Section 12.2. _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article_ __ _
XII_, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) and their officers, directors, employees and
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from and
against, without duplication, any Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from (i) prior to the
expiration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.1_, any breach or inaccuracy
of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller in _Article_ __ _
V_ of this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as if such
representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing, (ii) prior to
the expiration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 12.1_, any breach by
Seller to perform any of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement that
requires performance after the Closing Date, (iii) Taxes to the extent
provided under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e),_ and (iv) any Excluded Liabilities.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, (i) with respect
to claims for indemnification arising under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ (other
than for a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in the Seller Fundamental Representations), the cumulative
indemnification obligations of Seller shall in no event exceed $2,812,500 (the
" _Cap_ "), (ii) with respect to claims arising under (A) _ Section_ __ _
12.2(a)(i)_ for a breach or inaccuracy of a Seller Fundamental Representation,
(B) _ Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(ii)_ or (C) _ Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iii)_,
the cumulative indemnification obligations of Seller shall in no event exceed
the Purchase Price (the " _Purchase Price Cap_ "), (iii) with respect to
claims for indemnification arising under  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ (other
than for a breach or inaccuracy of the Seller Fundamental Representations),
Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person until
the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified
Persons exceeds $2,812,500 (the " _Deductible_ "), after which, Seller shall
only be obligated for such aggregate Losses in excess of Deductible up to the
Cap. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_ shall not apply in
respect of claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iv)_ or
Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons in respect of any Fraud.

 



79

    

Section 12.3. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article_ __ _
XII_, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
(excluding the Companies) and their officers, directors, employees and
representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ " and,
together with the Buyer Indemnified Persons, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from
and against any Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person
arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations or warranties made by Buyer in _Article_ __ _ VI_ of this
Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as if such representation or
warranty was made on and as of the Closing, (ii) any breach of Buyer to
perform any of its covenants in this Agreement that requires performance
after the Closing Date or (iii) any Assumed Liabilities.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, (i) with respect
to claims for indemnification arising under _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(i)_
(other than for a breach or inaccuracy of the Buyer Fundamental
Representations), the cumulative indemnification obligations of Buyer shall in
no event exceed $2,812,500, (ii) with respect to claims arising under (A) _
Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(i)_ for a breach or inaccuracy of the Buyer Fundamental
Representations or (B) _ Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(ii)_, the cumulative
indemnification obligations of Buyer shall in no event exceed the Purchase
Price, (iii) with respect to claims for indemnification arising under
_Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(i)_ (other than for a breach or inaccuracy of the
Buyer Fundamental Representations), Buyer shall not be required to indemnify
any Seller Indemnified Person until the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or
suffered by the Seller Indemnified Persons exceeds $2,812,500. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) except for clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _
12.3(b)_, none of the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.3(b)_
shall apply to claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(ii)_
or claims arising out of a breach of the Buyer Fundamental Representations,
and (ii) none of the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.3(b)_
shall apply to claims for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _
12.3(a)(iii)_.

Section 12.4. _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement shall
terminate on the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_), unless an Indemnified Party shall have incurred a Loss
prior to such applicable survival termination date and made an Indemnification
Claim (as defined below) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2_ or _12.3_ ,
subject to the terms and conditions of _Article_ __ _ XII_, prior to such
termination date, as applicable, including by delivering a Claim Notice (as
defined below) to the Indemnifying Party (as defined below). If an
Indemnified Party has made a proper Indemnification Claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 12.2_ or _12.3_ prior to such termination date,
then such claim for such Loss incurred (and only such claim for such Loss
incurred), if then unresolved, shall not be extinguished by the passage of the
deadlines set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1_.

 

Section 12.5. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. An Indemnified
Party shall give prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party or
parties obligated to provide

 



80

    

 indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") after the Indemnified Party
first becomes aware (and in any event within 30 days thereof) of the basis for
a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XII_ (including
any Third Party Claim) (such claim, an " _Indemnification Claim_ "), and such
Claim Notice shall contain (a) a reasonably detailed description and, if
reasonably available or determinable, the Loss incurred or reasonably expected
to be incurred by the Indemnified Party together with such supporting
documents reasonably available to such Indemnified Party, (b) a reasonably
detailed explanation of the basis for the Indemnification Claim to the extent
of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party, and (c) a demand for payment
of such Loss; _provided_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect such Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder and shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
_Article_ __ _ XII_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

Section 12.6. _Notice and Opportunity To Defend_. If there occurs an
indemnifiable event which involves any claim or the commencement of any
action or proceeding by a third Person, including any Governmental Body (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give such Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice (and in any event within 30 days of such Third
Party Claim) of such Third Party Claim or the commencement thereof. The
failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only if, and to the extent
that, such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to (a) participate in the defense of any
such Third Party Claim or (b) assume the defense thereof, with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) if (i) the Third
Party Claim relates primarily to any criminal Proceeding, (ii) the Third Party
Claim primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Third Party Claim is one in which
the Indemnifying Party is also a party and, based upon the advice of counsel,
joint representation would be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party which are inconsistent from to those
available to the Indemnifying Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of such election to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party hereunder for
any legal costs or expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except as otherwise provided in this _Article_ __ _ XII_. The
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to cooperate reasonably
with each other and their respective counsel in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Proceeding or asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim as
contemplated hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) at its own expense in the defense of such
Proceeding or asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Proceeding, no settlement or compromise thereof may be effected
(A) by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless (1) the settlement seeks only monetary relief and all such
relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party, (2)
the settlement or compromise provides for a full release by the party of the
Indemnified Party with respect to the claim(s) being settled, and (3) the
settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of finding or
wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party or (B) by the Indemnified Party
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of a Proceeding, neither the Indemnifying

 



81

    

 Party nor the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any such Proceeding
without the consent of the other party. Except as contemplated hereunder, in
no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement or
compromise effected without its prior written consent. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ XII_, the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not
assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
Indemnified Party shall have failed to give a Claim Notice of the Third Party
Claim as provided above), _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall only be obligated to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute
any Third Party Claim, (1) the parties shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof and (2) the Indemnifying Party shall pursue the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim in good faith. The provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 12.6_ shall not apply to the conduct of any Tax Claim, the
conduct of which shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_.

 

Section 12.7. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XII_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 12.8. _Additional Matters; Manner of Payment_.

 

(a) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement, any
Buyer Ancillary Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired
(or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives a payment in respect of Losses after
the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of such Losses, the
Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and promptly pay
to the Indemnifying Party the extent of such payment within five business
days after receipt. Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all steps as required by Law to mitigate any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected
to, or does, give rise thereto. An Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification pursuant to _Sections_ __ _ 12.2_ or _12.3_ , as applicable,
shall be reduced by the amount paid by a third party (including an insurance
company or any third party owing an indemnification or similar obligation to
the Indemnified Party), or paid by such third party to another for the account
or benefit of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, with respect to the
settlement or resolution of a claim for which Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, was entitled to indemnification hereunder. If an Indemnifying Party
makes any payment for any Losses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article_ __ _ VII_, such Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and
remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with respect to the
claim giving rise to such Losses.

 



82

    

(c) The amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or indemnification by, reimbursement or cash receipts from, or
indemnification agreement with any third-party with respect to such Losses, in
each case, net of reasonable costs of collection resulting from making any
claim thereunder. Buyer shall not make any claim for indemnification under
this _Article_ __ _ VII_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ to the extent any matter
that was taken into account in the determination of Working Capital or the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price in _Article_ __ _ IV_.

 

(d) With respect to indemnification claims made under _Sections_ __ _
12.2(a)(i)_ or  _12.3(a)(i)_ , for purposes of determining breach and
calculating the amount of any Losses attributable to any such breach,
inaccuracy or noncompliance, except in the case of _Section_ __ _ 5.4_,
_ Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.20_ and the Listing
Representations, all references to "material," "materiality," "material
respects", "Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications shall be
disregarded.

(e) Any payments required to be made by Seller to any Buyer Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ XII_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ shall
first be made as follows:

 

(i) First, from Seller until such Losses equal $2,812,500;

 

(ii) Second, with respect to Losses covered by the RandW Policy, under the
RandW Policy; and

 

(iii) Then, if and to the extent recoveries and amounts available to be
claimed under the RandW Policy have been exhausted for Losses and
Indemnification Claims remain unsatisfied, the Buyer Indemnified Person shall
then be entitled to pursue recovery of such remaining unsatisfied Losses from
Seller directly, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth
in this _Article_ __ _ XII_

Section 12.9. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to disputes related
to the Purchase Price adjustments in _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ (which shall be
governed exclusively by _Section_ __ _ 4.5_), the indemnification provisions
contained in this  _Article_ __ _ XII_, subject to the limitations set forth
herein, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to any party in
connection with any Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions following the Closing. The foregoing
notwithstanding, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 12.9_ shall limit or restrict
the ability or right of any party hereto to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 13.12_ for any breach or alleged breach
of any provision of this Agreement or in respect of Fraud; _provided_ , that
any procedures in respect of and limitations on Losses in this  _Article_ __
_ XII_, to the extent applicable, shall in no event be diminished or
circumvented by such relief. The parties agree that the provisions in this
Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on the remedies
hereunder with respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder.

Section 13.4. _Successors and Assigns_.

 

(a) The rights of either party under this Agreement shall not be assignable
by such party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the
other party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
shall have the right, without the prior written consent of Seller, to assign
all or any portion of their rights, interests, and obligations under this
Agreement to (i) any Affiliate (so long as Buyer and Parent remains fully
liable for all of its obligations hereunder) and/or (ii) any Financing Source
(as defined below) (so long as Buyer and Parent remains fully liable for all
of its obligations hereunder) for purposes of creating a security interest
herein or otherwise assigning collateral in respect of any debt financing.

 

(b) Following the Closing, neither party may assign any of its rights
hereunder or delegate its duties to any third Person without the written
consent of the other party, except that any party may assign its rights and
delegate its duties hereunder to an Affiliate. Any assignment hereunder
(whether before or after the Closing) shall not relieve the assigning party
of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and successors
and assigns permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 13.4_ and pursuant to _Article_
__ _ XI_ and _Sections_ __ _ 8.2(e)_, _8.5_ and  _13.16_ any right, remedy
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 13.5. _Access to Records after Closing_.

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to the personnel and all of the
books and records of the Companies to the extent that such access may
reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or
affected by the operations of the Companies prior to the Closing Date.

 



85

    

 Buyer agrees to maintain such records in readable and readily accessible
format during such six-year period. After such six-year period, Buyer may
destroy or dispose of such records after providing at least 60 days advance
written notice to Seller and an opportunity for Seller to obtain, at the cost
of Seller, copies of any such records. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer
upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.
Seller shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 13.5(a)_ and shall reimburse Buyer for any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
13.5(a)_.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to the personnel and all of the
books and records relating to the Companies which Seller or any of their
Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Seller agrees to maintain such
records in readable and readily accessible format during such six-year period.
After such six-year period, Seller may destroy or dispose of such records
after providing at least 60 days advance written notice to Buyer and
an opportunity for Buyer to obtain, at the cost of Buyer, copies of any such
records. Such access shall be afforded by Seller and their Affiliates upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. Seller
agrees to maintain such records in readable and readily accessible format
during such six-year period. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs
and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 13.5(b)_ and
shall reimburse Seller for any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.5(b)_.

 

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 13.5_ where such access would violate any Law, privilege
or confidentiality obligation.

 

Section 13.6. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the Exhibits
and Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto and
the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties
hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and
supersede all other prior representations, warranties, agreements,
understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the parties
hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except
by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the
parties hereto. _Section_ __ _ 13.13_, the last sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 13.6,_ and _Section_ __ _ 13.16_ of this Agreement may not be amended or
modified in whole or in part in a manner that adversely affects the rights of
the Financing Source Related Parties thereunder without the prior written
consent of the requisite commitment parties having consent over amendments to
this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter. 

Section 13.7. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. For this purpose, an email, even if it includes a signature block of
the sender, shall not be considered a "writing", although an electronic copy
of a document duly executed on behalf of a party hereto shall be considered a
"writing" even if transmitted by email or other electronic means. The failure
of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement
shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to
affect the validity of

 



86

    

 this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to
enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this
Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach.

Section 13.8. _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
each party hereto shall pay all costs and expenses incident to its
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and
compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to
be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements
of its counsel and independent public accountants.

 

Section 13.9. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision
hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a
construction would be unreasonable.

Section 13.10. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer.

Section 13.11. _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date each
party hereto shall take such other actions and execute such other documents
and instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably requested by
the other party hereto from time to time to effectuate or confirm the transfer
of the Shares to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 13.12. _Jurisdiction; Specific Performance_. Except as provided
herein with respect to non-judicial determinations and in _Section_ __ _
13.16_, any Proceeding hereunder or in respect of the Contemplated Transaction
may only be brought in federal or state court in Wilmington, Delaware. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

Section 13.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto waives the right
to a trial by jury in any Proceeding in connection with or relating to this
Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or
the Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 13.14. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party hereto
agrees that all documents, materials and other information which it shall
have obtained regarding the other parties during the course of the
negotiations leading to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions
(whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement),
the investigation

 



87

    

 provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and other related
documents shall be held in confidence pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at Closing.

Section 13.15. _Privilege; Waiver of Conflicts_. Buyer, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed after the
Closing to include the Companies) hereby (a) agrees that, notwithstanding any
current or prior representation of the Companies and Seller by Sidley Austin
LLP (" _Prior Companies Counsel_ "), Prior Companies Counsel shall be allowed
to represent Seller in any matters or disputes that arise under or relate to
the Contemplated Transactions, (b) waives any claim that Buyer, the Companies,
or any of their Affiliates has or may have that Prior Companies Counsel has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation, (c) agrees that, if a dispute arises after the Closing between
Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Seller on the other hand, then Prior Companies Counsel may represent
Seller in such dispute, even though the interests of Seller may be directly
adverse to Buyer or the Companies and even though Prior Companies Counsel may
have represented the Companies in matter substantially related to such dispute
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Companies, and (d) agrees that,
after the Closing, Seller shall retain, own, and control (in its sole and
absolute discretion) all communications between or among Prior Companies
Counsel and Seller or the Companies that relate, in any way, to the
Contemplated Transactions, and with respect to such information, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller
and may be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed or
disputed by Buyer or the Companies or any of their Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to
constitute an agreement by Seller or the Companies to waive any privilege of
the Companies with respect to any information or communication that does not
relate to any dispute under or relating to the Contemplated Transactions (it
being understood that any privilege of the Companies that attaches with
respect to such other matters shall be controlled solely by the Companies
after the Closing). Also, if a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer
or the Companies on the one hand, and any third party other than a Seller on
the other hand then the Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure to such third-party of confidential communications by Prior
Companies Counsel;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such
privilege relates in any way to the Contemplated Transactions, the Companies
may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Buyer acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed after the Closing to include the Companies) that it
has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning
the significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives
to, the waivers, permissions, and other provisions of this _Section_ __ _
13.15_, including the opportunity to consult with independent counsel of its
choice.

Section 13.16. _Financing Source Related Parties_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of
the parties agrees (a) that no Financing Source Related Party shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties or for any claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, or in respect of, or by
reason of, the Contemplated Transactions or in respect of any representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, (b) that, without limiting
the rights of any party hereto against the other parties hereto, in no event
shall any party hereto or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover

  



88

    

 monetary damages from, any Financing Source Related Party, in connection
with this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract,
tort or otherwise (it being understood that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
13.16_ shall limit the rights of Parent or Buyer against the Financing Source
Related Parties under the Commitment Letter), and (c) that it shall not bring
or support any Person, or permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in any
Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Source Related Parties in their capacities as
such in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
any Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; (b) agrees that,
except as specifically set forth in the terms of any Financing commitments,
all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Source Related Parties in
their capacities as such in any way relating to any Financing commitments or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal Laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction; and (c)
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY,
IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Financing Source Related Parties are intended
third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of
_Section_ __ _ 13.1_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 13.6_, _Section_
__ _ 13.13_ and this _Section_ __ _ 13.16_ to the same extent as if
the Financing Source Related Parties were parties to this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, (a) " _Financing Sources Related Parties_ " means
the Financing Sources, their Affiliates and their respective former,
current and future directors, officers, managers, members, stockholders,
partners, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns and (b) " _Financing Sources_ " means, in their capacity as
such, any lender providing a commitment pursuant to any Financing or any
Affiliates, employees, officers, directors, agents or advisors of any such
lender in connection with such commitment.

(a) Parent absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
Seller, the prompt and complete performance of Buyers obligations under this
Agreement and payment in full of all amounts due and payable by Buyer under

other provisions to the contrary, this  _Section_ __ _ 13.17_ shall not
modify the Obligations under this Agreement or require Parent, when performing

(c) The obligations of Parent hereunder shall be irrevocable, absolute and
unconditional, except as provided in the last paragraph of _Section_ __ _
13.17(e)_ hereof, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as

shall not be affected, modified or impaired or prejudiced (i) by any other
security now or hereafter held by the Seller as security for the Obligations
of Buyer under this Agreement, or (ii) upon the occurrence of any one or more
of the following whether or not with notice to or consent by Buyer or Parent,
as applicable (except to the extent that its consent may be required pursuant

(i) the compromise, settlement, release, change, modification or
termination of any of the Obligations; 

(ii) the extension of time for payment of any of the Obligations;

and to proceed against Parent for recovery of the total of any and all amounts
due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 13.17_, or to proceed from time to time
against Parent for such portion of any and all such amounts as Parent may
determine.

(e) With respect to all Obligations, this is a guarantee of punctual
and complete performance and payment and not of collection, and Parent hereby
waives and relinquishes:

 

(i) any right to require the Seller to proceed against Buyer, or any other
Person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by the Seller at
any time or to pursue performance by any Person or any other remedy in
Sellers power before proceeding against Parent;

 



90

    

(ii) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of
authority, death or disability of any other Person or the failure of Seller to
file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or
any other proceeding) of any other Person;

 

(iii) other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 13.17(b)_ above, demand,
presentment, protest and notice of any kind, including any action or non-
action on the part of any of Buyer, the Seller, the Companies, any creditor of
any of Buyer or Parent or on the part of any other Person under this or any
other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness
held by the Seller as collateral or in connection with any Obligations hereby
guaranteed; or

 

(iv) any defense arising because of the exercise of any right or remedy
available to, or election made by, Seller pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code,

or otherwise.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section_ __ _ 13.17_ to the
contrary, Parent reserves to itself (i) all rights, setoffs, counterclaims,
recoupments and other defenses to which Buyer is entitled in accordance with
this Agreement (the " _Buyer Defenses_ ") (except for defenses arising out of
the bankruptcy of Buyer or the incapacity or lack of authority of Buyer to
enter into or perform its obligations under this Agreement), and Parent shall
be entitled to assert any such Buyer Defense to the same extent that any such
Buyer Defense could be asserted by Buyer in any action brought by Seller to
enforce an Obligation against Buyer and (ii) subject to _Section_ __ _
13.17_, all rights and remedies accorded by Law to sureties or guarantors
based on the defense of the statute of limitations related to the
enforceability of this _Section_ __ _ 13.17_ in any action hereunder or in
any action for the payment of any Obligations hereby guaranteed.

(f) _Termination; Reinstatement of Guaranty_.

 

(i) Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 13.17(f)(ii)_, this

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 13.17(f)(i)_, this 
_Section_ __ _ 13.17_ shall be reinstated if at any time following the
termination of this Section under _Section_ __ _ 13.17(f)(i)_, any payment by
Parent or Buyer of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned
by the Seller upon the bankruptcy of Buyer or Parent or otherwise, and is so
rescinded or returned to the party or parties making such payment, all as
though such payment had not been made. Such period of reinstatement
shall continue until satisfaction of the conditions contained in, and shall
continue to be subject to, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 13.17(f)_.

 

(g) Parent acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and
indirect benefits from the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and
that the covenants, agreements and waivers set forth in this Section are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
