which they are entitled to receive upon exchange of their Old Certificates

deliver the notice required under Section 6.2 of the Mid-State Bancshares

awards granted under the Mid-State Bancshares 2005 Equity Based Compensation
Plan. Prior to the Effective Time and in accordance with the provisions of
the Mid-State Bancshares 2005 Equity Based Compensation Plan, each
outstanding Company Stock Option granted under the Mid-State Bancshares 2005
Equity Based Compensation Plan, whether vested or unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and terminated by the Company in
exchange for the right to receive an amount of cash immediately prior to the
Effective Time equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such Company Stock Option, multiplied by the Option Spread, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. In
order to facilitate the determination of the amounts to be paid pursuant to
the preceding sentence, all Company Stock Options granted under the Mid-
State Bancshares 2005 Equity Based Compensation Plan shall cease to be
exercisable three days prior to the Effective Time.  The " _Option Spread_ "
for a Company Stock Option will be equal to the Per Share Amount less the
exercise price of the Company Stock Option.

  

### (b) At least 45 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i)
fully vest all then outstanding Company Stock Options granted under the Mid-
State Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan, and (ii) give notice (the " _Option
Notice_ ") of such vesting and the pendency of the Effective Time to all
persons holding outstanding Company Stock Options granted under the Mid-State
Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan as required under Section 15 of the Mid-
State Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan. The Option Notice shall provide
that during the period commencing on the date that is five days after the
date of the Option Notice and ending on the date that is 31 days thereafter
(the " _Exercise Period_ "), each person receiving the Option Notice shall
have the right to exercise their vested Company Stock Options granted under
the Mid-State Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan. Any Company Stock
Options granted under the Mid-State Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan which
are not exercised during the Exercise Period will cease to be exercisable
after the Exercise Period. After the Exercise Period and prior to the
Effective Time each outstanding Company Stock Option granted under the Mid-
State Bancshares 1996 Stock Option Plan will be cancelled and terminated by
the Company in exchange for the right to receive an amount of cash
immediately prior to the Effective Time equal to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
the Option Spread, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment.

     

   

## 3.06. _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision

of the steps required by Section 1300(b) of the CCC to properly exercise and
perfect such shareholders dissenters rights (any such shares being referred
to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall, in the event such Dissenting
Shares, in the aggregate, represent 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, be deemed to have ceased to represent any interest in
the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time and shall be entitled to
those rights and remedies set forth in Chapter 13 of the CCC; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event that a shareholder of the Company fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right or remedy granted by the
CCC, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder shall be
converted into the Per Share Amount as specified in this Agreement; and
_provided further_ , that in the event Dissenting Shares, in the
aggregate, represent less than 5% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, all such Dissenting Shares shall be converted into the Per Share
Amount as specified in this Agreement.

  

### (b) The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any notice or
demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received
by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate

liability other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

 **ARTICLE VI**

  

 **Covenants**

  

## 6.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Acquiror and the Company will each use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable
under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly
as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with, and furnish
information to, the other party to that end.

  

### (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.01(a), the Company
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent or approval
of all persons party to a Contract with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to the extent such consent or approval is required in order to
consummate the Merger and the Other Mergers or for the Surviving Corporation
to receive the benefit of such Contract.

  

## 6.02. _Shareholder Approval_. The Company Board will submit to
its shareholders the principal terms of this Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved or adopted by shareholders in order to carry
out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, the
Company will take, in accordance with the CCC, other applicable law,
applicable NASDAQ National Market System rules, the rules of any other
relevant exchange and its Constituent Documents, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement, the " _Company Meeting_ "), as promptly as practicable, to
consider and vote upon approval of the principal terms of this Agreement as
well as any other such related matters. The

     

   

## Company Board will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its
shareholders a vote approving the principal terms of this
Agreement, including providing an unqualified recommendation that its
shareholders vote in favor of the Merger. The Company Board will not impose
a requirement that the holders of more than a majority of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger and the
principal terms of the Agreement approve the Merger and the principal terms
of the Agreement. If the Company Board, after consultation with (and based on
the advice of) outside counsel, determines in good faith that, because of the
receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would more likely
than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law
to continue to recommend the approval of the principal terms of this
Agreement, then, in submitting the principal terms of this Agreement to the
Company Meeting, the Company Board may submit principal terms of this
Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate the
basis for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by law; _provided_ that the Company Board __ may not take any actions
under this sentence until after giving Acquiror at least five business days
to respond to such Acquisition Proposal (and after giving Acquiror notice of
the latest material terms, conditions and identity of the third party in the
Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Acquiror.

  

## 6.03. _Proxy Statement._ (a) The Company will prepare a proxy statement
for the Company Meeting (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents,
and file a preliminary draft Proxy Statement with the SEC no later than
December 15, 2006. Each party will cooperate, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other party, its counsel and
its accountants, in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto, the solicitation of proxies and preparation for the
Company Meeting, and, the Company agrees to file the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto with the SEC within the time required to
permit the Company Meeting to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
and the Closing to occur in a timely manner.  Each party shall cooperate and
provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any amendment to the Proxy Statement prior to filing it with the SEC.

  

### (b) The Company shall promptly notify Acquiror of the receipt of all
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by
the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information
and shall promptly provide to Acquiror copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Acquiror shall each use its best efforts to
promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received
on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the SEC
staff

     

   

### advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

  

### (c) Each of Acquiror and the Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading.
Acquiror and the Company each further agrees that if it becomes aware that
any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof
and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

  

## 6.04. _Press Releases_. Acquiror and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing any press release, written employee communication
or other written shareholder communication with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement and will not issue any such communication or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_  that a party may, without
the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the
extent practicable under the circumstances), issue such communication or make
such public statement as may be required by applicable law or securities
exchange rules; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such party shall immediately
inform the other party of the issuance of such public communication or the
making of such public statement.  Acquiror and the Company will cooperate to
develop all public communications and make appropriate members of management
available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as
reasonably requested by the other party.

  

## 6.05. _Access; Information_. (a) The Company agrees that upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, but without causing unreasonable disruption to its business,
it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Acquiror, and
officers, employees, counsel, accountants of Acquiror and its Affiliates and
other authorized Representatives, such access during normal business hours to
the Companys books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and
work papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other
information as Acquiror may reasonably request and the Company will furnish
promptly to Acquiror (1) a copy of each report, schedule and other document
filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities or
banking laws, and (2) all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of it as Acquiror may reasonably request. Acquiror
shall have the opportunity to conduct an environmental assessment of the
parcels of real property owned by the Company, Company Bank or their
Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
property referred to as the

     

   

## "Gibson" site), using a consulting firm or consulting firms
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Such assessment shall consist, for
each property, of a "phase one" review, to be followed by a "phase two"
review where Acquiror, in its reasonable discretion, shall deem necessary,
but shall be completed within 90 days of the date hereof. In connection with
such assessment, the Company, Company Bank and their Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and assist Acquirors environmental consultant or consultants in
the preparation of the environmental assessment and make reasonably available
its properties, records, documents, consultants and employees. Acquiror and
Acquiror Bank shall hold, and shall cause their counsel, accountants and
other agents and representatives to hold, all such information and documents
in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

### (b) Acquiror will hold confidential any information which is nonpublic
and confidential to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
Confidentiality Agreement between Acquiror and the Company, dated June 6,
2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

## 6.06. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company will not, and will cause
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors and Affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in
any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic
information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_  that in the event the Company receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, including from an Other
Person (as defined below) after the execution of this Agreement, and the
Company Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Company Board concludes in
good faith (and based on the advice of outside counsel) that failure to take
such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ _further_ that prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to the Company
than the Confidentiality Agreement (without regard to any modification
thereof pursuant hereto). The Company will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before
and/or on the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Acquiror ("
_Other Persons_ ") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly (within 24
hours) advise Acquiror following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the
substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Acquiror apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

  



   

41   

 

  

### (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  

## 6.07. _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The Company will not take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Voting
Agreements to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and the
Company will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure
the continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as
now or hereafter in effect. The Company will not take any action that would
cause the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Voting Agreements not to
comply with any Takeover Provisions and the Company will take all necessary
steps within its control to make those transactions comply with (or continue
to comply with) any Takeover Provisions.

  

## 6.08. _Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents; Estoppel
Certificates_.  (a) Each of Acquiror and the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental
Authorities that are required to be effected or obtained by it (the "
_Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and use all reasonable best efforts to
take all actions required to eliminate any impediments, known or which may
become known to either party, to the receipt of any Requisite Regulatory
Approval as soon as reasonably possible, and of all other third parties from
which it is required to obtain consents (the " _Third-Party Consents_ "),
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and to obtain
customary estoppel certificates from landlords under the leases of real
property under which the Company, Company Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
is a lessee or sublessee, and will make all necessary filings in respect of
those Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Third-Party Consents for which it is
responsible within 30 days after the date hereof or, if making such filings
within the prescribed 30-day period is not reasonably practicable, as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. Each of Acquiror and the Company will
have the right to review in advance, promptly comment on and receive copies
of correspondence and requests for amendments or supplements to such filings
and, to the extent practicable, each party will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to all material written information submitted to any third party
or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals and Third-Party Consents.  In exercising the foregoing right, each
of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.  In
addition, each party will (i) promptly inform the other party of (and supply
to the other party) any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda)
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii)
consult with the other party in advance, to the extent practicable and not
prohibited by law, of any meeting or

     

   

## 

  

conference with any Governmental Authority. Each party agrees that it will
consult with the other party with respect to obtaining all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and each party will keep the other party appraised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

### (b) Acquiror and the Company will, subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party will cooperate with the other party and will
assist the other party as reasonably requested to permit the other party to
obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and Third-Party Consents to be
obtained by the other party.

  

## 6.09. _No Rights Triggered._ The Company shall take all reasonable
steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and any other action or combination of actions, or any
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, do not and will not result
in the grant of any Rights to any person (a) under the Companys
Constituent Documents or (b) under any material Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except, in each case, as Previously
Disclosed or contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreements.

  

## 6.10. _Indemnification_. (a) Following the Effective Time and for a
period of six years thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Party_
") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities as incurred, in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby), to the full extent as such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the
Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on
the date of this Agreement with the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

### (b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will use all reasonable best efforts to provide directors and
officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors of the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated

     

   

### 

  

### hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by the Company;
_provided_ that (1) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend in the aggregate over such six-year period, more than 250 percent
of the current amount expended yearly by the Company to maintain or procure
such directors and officers insurance coverage; (2) if the cost
thereof exceeds the threshold of subparagraph (1) or if the Surviving
Corporation is otherwise unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 6.10(b), the Surviving Corporation will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is
reasonably available at an aggregate cost of not more than 250 percent of the
current amount expended yearly by the Company to maintain or procure such
directors and officers insurance coverage; and (3) present and former
officers and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to the
Surviving Corporations insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.

  

### (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that failure so to notify will not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.10(a) unless and to
the extent that the Surviving Corporation is materially prejudiced as a
consequence. In the event of a Claim (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (1) Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and Acquiror shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall be obligated pursuant
to this Section 6.10(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for
such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, (2) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter, and (3) Acquiror shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and _provided_ _further_ that Acquiror shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and non-appealable, that the indemnification of such

     

   

### 

  

### Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law.

  

### (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence of the Holding Company
Merger, Acquiror will assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
under this Section 6.10.

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

  

## 6.11. _Funds_.  Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to have, at the Effective
Time, cash on hand in an aggregate amount sufficient to enable Merger Sub to
timely perform its obligations hereunder, including to pay in full (i) an
amount equal to the Exchange Fund, and (ii) all fees and expenses payable by
Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

## 6.12. _Employee Matters_. (a) As soon as possible after the date
hereof, but in no event later than 10 days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall amend, or shall cause the Company Bank to amend,
the 401(k) Plan, in accordance with ERISA and the Code, to (i) provide that
the only form of benefit payment under the 401(k) Plan is a single lump sum
payment, (ii) provide that from and after the date of amendment, 401(k)
Plan participants may not take out more than one 401(k) Plan loan,
(iii) prohibit any subsequent investment in employer securities (as defined
in Section 407(d) of ERISA), and (iv) comply with final regulations
issued under Sections 401(k) and 401(m) of the Code. All 401(k) Plan
participants shall be fully vested in their 401(k) Plan accounts effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall terminate, or
shall cause the Company Bank to terminate, the 401(k) Plan effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who
continue to be employed by Acquiror Bank or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who have sufficient service
(taking into account service credited pursuant to Section 6.12(c)) under the
tax-qualified retirement plan maintained by Acquiror Bank, shall be allowed
to enter active participation in the tax-qualified retirement plan maintained
by Acquiror Bank in accordance with its terms and conditions and the tax-
qualified retirement plan maintained by Acquiror Bank shall agree to
accept rollovers of Covered Employees account balances (provided such
balances constitute an "eligible rollover distribution" under Section 402(c)
of the Code), including one loan, subject to the receipt of a favorable
determination letter regarding the termination of the

     

   

## 

  

401(k) Plan, or at an earlier time as agreed to by the parties. During the
period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Effective Time,
Company Bank will use its reasonable best efforts to provide advice and
guidance to Employees with more than one loan outstanding under the 401(k)
Plan regarding refinancing and consolidating loans so that such Employees
only have one outstanding loan under the 401(k) Plan as of the Effective
Time. Any discretionary profit sharing contribution made to the 401(k) Plan,

Agreement) to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval or with

## 9.07. _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
and the Voting Agreements represent the entire understanding of Acquiror and
the Company regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any
and all other oral or written agreements previously made or purported to be
made, other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. No representation, warranty,
inducement, promise, understanding or condition not set forth in
this Agreement has been made or relied on by any party in entering into
this Agreement. Except for Section 6.10, which is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties to the extent stated, nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement

     

   

## 

  

is intended to confer any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon
any person other than Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company.

  

## 9.08. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part (except by operation of law), by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of each other party hereto, except that
Acquiror and Merger Sub may assign or delegate in their sole discretion any
or all of their rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement to any
direct or indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror, but no such
assignment shall relieve Acquiror of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

## 9.09. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will
remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party.  Upon such determination, the parties will negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute
provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

  

## 9.10. _Alternative Structure_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, before the
Effective Time, Acquiror may revise the structure of the Merger or otherwise
revise the method of effecting the Merger and related transactions;
_provided_  that (1) such revision does not alter or change the kind or
amount of consideration to be delivered to the shareholders of the Company
and the holders of Company Stock Options, (2) such revision does not
adversely affect the tax consequences to the shareholders of the Company, (3)
such revised structure or method is reasonably capable of consummation
without significant delay in relation to the structure contemplated herein,
and (4) such revision does not otherwise cause any of the conditions set
forth in Article VII not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof).  This Agreement and any
related documents will be appropriately amended in order to reflect any such
revised structure or method.

 **IN WITNESS WHEREOF,**  the parties have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above
written.
