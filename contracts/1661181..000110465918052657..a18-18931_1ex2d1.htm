AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of August 17,
2018, by and among Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., a Cayman
Islands exempted company (" _Parent_ "), Avista Healthcare Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and Organogenesis Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall individually be
referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Parties_ ". The
term " _Agreement_ " as used herein refers to this Agreement and Plan of
Merger, as the same may be amended from time to time, and all schedules,
exhibits and annexes hereto (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the

section and, if applicable, subsection in which the definition of each such
term is located.

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

A. Parent is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted
company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar
Business Combination with one or more businesses. Immediately prior to the
Closing (as defined below) or at any earlier time subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Parent shall transfer by way of continuation out of the Cayman
Islands into the State of Delaware or domesticate as a Delaware corporation
(the " _Domestication_ ") in accordance with Section 388 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Cayman Islands
Companies Law (2018 Revision) (" _Cayman Law_ ").

 



 

B. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL and other applicable Legal Requirements (the "
_Applicable Legal Requirements_ "), the Parties intend to enter into a
Business Combination by which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") with the Company being the surviving entity of the Merger
(the Company, in its capacity as the surviving corporation in the Merger, is
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 



 

C. As a result of the Merger, among other things, each existing share of
common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, as further provided by this Agreement.

 



 

D. For U.S. federal income tax (as defined below) purposes, each of the
Parties intends that the Domestication will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement be,
and hereby is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

 



 

E. The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
the stockholders of

 



      
 

 



 

the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement providing
for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, (b) approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby including the Merger in accordance with
the DGCL on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and (c)
adopted a resolution recommending the plan of merger set forth in this
Agreement be adopted by the stockholders of the Company.

 



 

F. Stockholders of the Company holding at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock will (i) execute and deliver to Parent, Company

hereto as _Exhibit A_ within 24 hours of the date hereof, and (ii) approve
and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "), acting by written consent in accordance with Section 228 of the
DGCL, as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement (as
hereinafter defined) shall have become effective and in any event no later
than the 5th Business Day following the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement.

 



 

G. The board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has unanimously
(a) determined that it is in the best interests of Parent and the shareholders
of Parent, and declared it advisable, to effect the Domestication, enter into
this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL and Cayman
Law, as applicable, (b) approved this Agreement and the Transactions
contemplated hereby including the Merger in accordance with the DGCL and
Cayman Law, as applicable, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and (c) adopted a resolution recommending the plan of merger set
forth in this Agreement be adopted by the shareholders of Parent (the "
_Parent Recommendation_ ").

 



 

H. Sponsor will execute and deliver to the Company a Parent Support Agreement
(as hereinafter defined) substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
B_ concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent.

 



 

I. Certain creditors of the Company are executing and delivering to Parent,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an Exchange
Agreement (the " _Exchange Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such creditors
have agreed to the repayment and satisfaction in full of the outstanding debt
obligations of the Company owed to them in exchange for: (i) 6,502,679 shares
of AHPAC Common Stock equal to $45,746,347.00 of the outstanding principal
amount of such debt obligations as of immediately prior to the Closing,
divided by $7.035, (ii) a cash payment equal to $22,000,000.00 of the
outstanding principal amount of such debt obligations and (iii) a cash payment
in the amount of the accrued and unpaid interest and fees on such debt
obligations as of and through the Closing Date.

 



 

J. Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
have received and shall have made available to Parent consents (the " _Debt
Consents_ ") from the lenders in connection with the Existing Credit
Agreements as are necessary or desirable in order to ensure that upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there shall
be no Default or Event of Default (as each such term is defined in the
Existing Credit Agreement) under the Existing Credit Agreements, which such
consents shall (i) be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and (ii) specifically approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

K. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
is consummating an equity financing in an aggregate amount of $46,000,000 (the
" _Initial Private Investment_ "). Immediately prior to the Closing, Parent
will consummate an equity financing in an aggregate amount of $46,000,000 (the
" _Additional Private Investment_ " and, together with the Initial Private
Investment, the " _Private Investments_ ") in accordance with the terms of the
Subscription Agreements entered into as of the date hereof.

 



 

L. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Class B
Holders shall enter into a letter agreement in the form mutually agreed upon
by the Company and Parent (the " _Parent Sponsor Letter Agreement_ ") pursuant
to which the Class B Holders shall agree to surrender to Parent (i) an

_Exhibit C_ shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Charter_ "), and (ii) the Bylaws of
Merger Sub in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ shall
become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation
Bylaws_ "), except that, in each case, the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Organogenesis Inc.".

 



 

2.3 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the board of directors and executive officers of the Company shall be
the board of directors and executive officers of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Charter Documents of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

 



 

2.4 _Effect of the Merger on Securities of the Constituent Corporations_.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and this Agreement and without any further action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holders of any of the
securities of Parent or the Company Common Stock, the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_.

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Parent, and shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each such share
of Company Common Stock, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ ")) will be automatically cancelled and extinguished and be converted,
into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid in and
nonassessable shares of AHPAC Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (which
consideration shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any reference herein to a "Certificate" shall be
deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the
ownership of Company Common Stock) formerly representing any shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), and each book-entry account
statement relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of such Excluded Share, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Options_. Each outstanding Company Option (whether
vested or unvested) shall be assumed by Parent and automatically converted
into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed
Option_ "). Subject to the subsequent sentence, each Assumed Option will be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Companys 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan and applicable award agreement (except any references therein
to the Company or Company Common Stock will instead mean Parent and AHPAC
Common Stock, respectively). Each Assumed Option shall: (i) have the right to
acquire a number of shares of AHPAC Common Stock equal to (as rounded down to
the nearest whole number) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock which the Company Option had the right to acquire immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio; (ii) have
an exercise price equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the
quotient of (A) the exercise price of the Company Option (in U.S. Dollars),
divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; (iii) be subject to the same vesting
schedule as the applicable Company Option; and (iv) be administered by
Parents Board of Directors or a committee thereof. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.4(b)_ under the Company Equity Plan, the applicable award agreements and
applicable Law, including delivering all required notices, obtaining any
consents, making any amendments and passing resolutions of the Company Board
or a committee thereof. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long
as any of the Assumed Options remain outstanding, a sufficient number of
shares of AHPAC Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of such Assumed
Option.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the Company Warrants that
expire or are deemed automatically net exercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time according to their terms as of the date of this Agreement as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be cancelled,
retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Stock and each holder thereof shall instead have the right to receive
from the Parent a new warrant for shares of AHPAC Common Stock (each, a "
_Replacement Parent Warrant_ "). Each Replacement Parent Warrant shall have,
and be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in
the Company Warrants, except that: (i) the number of shares of AHPAC Common
Stock which can be purchased with each Replacement Parent Warrant shall equal
a number of shares equal to (as rounded down to the nearest whole number) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis) which the Company Warrant had the
right to acquire immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio; and (ii) the exercise price for each Replacement Parent
Warrant shall be equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the
quotient of (A) the exercise price of the Company Warrant (in U.S. Dollars),
divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation
for so long as any of the Replacement Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of shares of AHPAC Common
Stock for delivery upon the exercise of such Replacement Parent Warrants.

 



 

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of AHPAC Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, and each Company Stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of AHPAC Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of AHPAC Common Stock that otherwise would
be received by such Company Stockholder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of
such fractional share, one (1) share of AHPAC Common Stock.

 



 

(e) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any share or stock
split, reverse stock split, share consolidation, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Shares
or AHPAC Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, share capitalization,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Shares or AHPAC
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof until the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and fully outstanding share of
common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

2.5 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a
commercial bank or trust company with the Companys prior approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates
for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Deposit._ On the Closing Date, Parent will deposit with the Exchange
Agent, the number of shares of AHPAC Common Stock sufficient to pay any Per
Share Merger Consideration that may be payable from time to time following the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall mail, or shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail, to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of

 



      
 

 



 

the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section 2.5(f)_) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for surrendering the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.5(f)_) to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section _
_2.5(f)_ ) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter
of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor one or more shares of AHPAC Common Stock which shall
represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of AHPAC Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.7_; _provided that_ ,
to the extent that, prior to the Effective Time, any Certificates are
delivered to the Exchange Agent with completed letters of transmittal in
accordance with this _Section 2.5(c)_ at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, then Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue to
the former holder of such Certificates, promptly after the Effective Time, the
number of shares of AHPAC Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.7_. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the shares of AHPAC Common Stock to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(d) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for (without interest and after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.7_) that number of shares
of AHPAC Common Stock equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by the Certificate multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the Company Stockholders for 180 days after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.7_) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.5(f)_), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, (i) upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and (ii) if required by Parent, the provision by such Person of an
indemnity (in form and substance mutually agreed by Parent and the Company)
against any claim that may be made against it, the Company, or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue
the Per Share Merger Consideration such Person has a right to receive pursuant
to Article I (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.7_).

 



 

2.6 _Tax Treatment of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
Parties shall not take or cause to be taken any action, or knowingly fail to
take or cause to be taken any action, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to prevent (i) the Domestication from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and (ii)
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 



 

(b) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
Parties will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.6_ and will not take any inconsistent position
on any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law following a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or
good-faith administrative settlement with (or final administrative decision
by) the relevant Governmental Entity. The Parties hereby adopt this Agreement
as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code and
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

 



 

(c) The parties agree that Parent may cause the Domestication to be
consummated at any time prior to the Closing.

 



 

2.7 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
(including its payroll agent), the Exchange Agent and their Affiliates shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To the extent
that amounts are so properly withheld and remitted to the relevant
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

2.8 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and perfected
appraisal rights for such

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration described in _Section 2.4(a)_
attributable to such Dissenting Shares. Such stockholders shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock
held by them in accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such stockholders
fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal
rights under the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right
to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock under the DGCL (whether
occurring before, at or after the Effective Time) shall thereupon be deemed to
be converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest, attributable to such Dissenting Shares upon their surrender in the
manner provided in Section 2.5.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands by
dissenting stockholders received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served on the Company and any material
correspondence received by the Company in connection with such demands.

 



 

2.9 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Closing Date, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and
necessary action.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY_

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding numbered section of the letter dated
as of the date of this Agreement delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger

Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. The Company is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("
_Approvals_ ") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or other comparable governing instruments with
different

 



      
 

 



 

names) (collectively referred to herein as " _Charter Documents_ ") of the
Company, as amended and currently in effect, have been delivered or made
available to Parent. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions
of the Companys Charter Documents.

 



 

(b) The Company is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or license would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each jurisdiction in which the Company is
qualified or licensed to do business.

 



 

3.2 _Company Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) The Companys direct and indirect Subsidiaries, together with their state
of incorporation or formation, as applicable, are listed in _Section 3.2(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "). The Company
owns all of the outstanding equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries,
free and clear of all Liens. Except for the Company Subsidiaries, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any ownership, equity, profits or voting
interest in any Person or have any agreement or commitment to purchase any
such interest, and has not agreed and is not obligated to make nor is bound by
any written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract, lease, binding
understanding, instrument, note, option, warranty, purchase order, license,
sublicense, insurance policy, benefit plan, commitment or undertaking of any
nature, as of the date hereof or as may hereafter be in effect under which it
may become obligated to make any future investment in or capital contribution
to any other Person.

 



 

(b) Each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Company Subsidiary that is a limited liability company is duly organized or
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of
organization or formation and has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary is in possession of
all Approvals necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents
of each Company Subsidiary, as amended and currently in effect, have been
heretofore delivered or made available to Parent. No Company Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Each Company Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which the character of the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so qualified or license would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section
3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each jurisdiction in which
any Company Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business.

 



 

3.3 _Capitalization_.

Company Warrants (including in each case the grant date, number and type of
shares issuable thereunder, the exercise price, the expiration date, any
vesting schedule and, with respect to the Company Options only, whether
subject to Section 422 of the Code) as of the date of this Agreement. Each
Company Option was granted with an exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock equal to or greater than the fair market value of a share of Company
Common Stock on the grant date of such Company Option, as determined in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code and is not otherwise subject to
Section 409A of the Code. All Company Options have been granted and
administered in accordance with the applicable Company Equity Plan, the
applicable option agreement and Applicable Legal Requirements. The Company
Warrants are not subject to Section 409A of the Code. Other than as set forth
in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no securities or
ownership interests are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
warrants or other rights to purchase Company Common Stock. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized, validly issued,

performance unit, profit participation, restricted stock, restricted stock
unit or other equity-based compensation award or similar rights with respect
to the Company.

with the Transactions, there are no registration rights, and there is no

of the Transactions, no shares of capital stock, warrants, options or other

their terms, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

January 1, 2015 have been, in compliance with all Applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or
operation of its business, except for failures to comply or violations which

equity and cash flows (including any related notes thereto) of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016
and 2015 (the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements comply as

case of Parent or Merger Sub); _provided that_ , (x) prior to any disclosure
contemplated by clause (iv) above, the Party required to disclose such non-
public information will provide prompt written notice of such requirement to
the other Party so that the other Party may seek, at such other Partys cost,
a protective order or other remedy and (y) in the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained the party required to disclose such non-
public information will disclose or furnish only that portion of non-public
information which is legally required to be provided as advised in writing by
outside counsel and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances

 



      
 

 



 

that confidential treatment will be accorded such non-public information. In
the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in _ARTICLE ** ** VIII_
hereof, each Party will destroy or return or cause to be destroyed or returned
to the other all documents and other material obtained from the other in
connection with the Merger contemplated hereby; _provided that_ neither Party

avoid any Legal Proceeding, (c) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties required as a result of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, including the consents referred to in _Section
3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood, for the

limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of their assets or properties), (d) the defending of any
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or

regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, use its commercially reasonable efforts to enable the Merger
and the other Transactions to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, the imposition
of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or
to own or exercise control of their respective assets, properties and capital
stock, or the incurrence of any liability or expense.

 



 

6.6 _No Parent Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall knowingly engage in any
transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of the
making of a public announcement regarding the Transactions. The Company shall

comply with the foregoing requirement.

 



 

6.7 _No Claim Against Trust Account_. The Company hereby waives all right,
title, interest or claim of any kind against Parent to collect from the Trust
Account any monies that may be owed to it by Parent for any reason whatsoever,
including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by Parent or any
negotiations, agreements or understandings with Parent (whether in the past,
present or future), and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at
any time for any reason whatsoever; _provided_ , that (a) nothing in this
_Section 6.7_ shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companys right to pursue
a claim against Parent pursuant to this Agreement for legal relief against
monies or other assets of Parent or Merger Sub held outside of the Trust
Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or for fraud and (b) nothing in this
_Section 6.7_ shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company
may have in the future pursuant to this Agreement against Parents or Merger
Subs assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of
_Section 8.1(b)_ (but only if the Transactions have failed to close by the
date specified therein because of Parents or Merger Subs breach of an
obligation herein), _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_, and Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries completes a Business Combination with another company, the
Company shall not be prohibited from filing and pursuing a claim for damages
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions following consummation
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of an alternative Business Combination,
in each case against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that
is party to such alternative Business Combination or any Affiliate thereof
Furthermore, Parent and Merger Sub shall not execute any definitive agreement
related to such Business Combination that (x) attempts to prevent the Company
from so filing or pursuing any such claim, or (y) permits the Person that
survives such combination not to assume Parent and Merger Subs obligation for
damages in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. This paragraph
will survive this Agreement and will

 



      
 

 



 

not expire and will not be altered in any way without the express written
consent of Parent and the Company.

not to be satisfied, (b) would require any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or (c) constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result
in, any Transaction Litigation. The Company and Parent shall have the
obligation to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, respectively, being delivered concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement with respect to any matter hereafter
arising or discovered which, if existing or known prior to the execution and

Company Disclosure Letter, or the Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively. The
obligation of the Company and Parent to amend or supplement the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, shall
terminate on the Closing Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will promptly
provide the Company with written notice of any event, development or condition
of which they have Knowledge that is reasonably likely to cause any of the

condition of which it has Knowledge that is reasonably likely to cause any of

the shares of AHPAC Common Stock issued in connection with the Transactions to

Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the
of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to

the Indemnified Party was serving in such capacity at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in any case occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Legal
Requirement or provided under the Charter Documents of the Surviving

Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another enterprise (including any litigation arising out of or pertaining to
matters occurring or existing or alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the
Effective Time, or arising out of or pertaining to this Agreement and the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified Party in connection with and
prior to the final disposition of such litigations, such fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) to be advanced within

merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.12(e)_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as a
witness) in any litigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 6.12_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such litigation.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and

of or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein that would be
deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Code Section
280G) (such waived amounts, the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all

than five (5) Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers and approval, the
Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Parent

Parent evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited
in accordance with the foregoing and whether the requisite number of votes of
the stockholders of the Company was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G

in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this

9.3 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the Transactions, and the consummation
thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same document and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the
other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Delivery by facsimile or electronic transmission to counsel for
the other Parties of a counterpart executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet
the requirements of the previous sentence.

 



 

9.4 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; and (b) other than the rights, at and after the
Effective Time, of Persons pursuant to the provisions

other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

 



 

9.5 _Severability_. In the event that any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the application of such term, provision, covenant or restriction to
other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction of this

restriction that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or
restriction.

 



 

9.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise
by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction and immediate injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being required, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may
be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be
difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive
relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue hardship to the
parties. Each of the parties hereto hereby further acknowledges that the
existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish
the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any
other injunctive relief. Each party hereto hereby further agrees that in the
event of any action by any other party for specific performance or injunctive
relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be
adequate or that specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of such
breach or violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages
are adequate or any other grounds.

 



 

9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and each other document executed in
connection with the Transactions, and the consummation thereof, and any
action, suit, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement and
each other document executed in connection with the Transactions, and the
consummation thereof, or the validity, interpretation, breach or termination
of this Agreement and each other document executed in connection with the
Transactions, and the consummation thereof, shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the
law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
courts of the State of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of
Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of

Transactions, and the consummation thereof, agrees that process may be served
upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for
such Persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection
which they might otherwise have to such manner of service of process. Each
Party and any Person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so
only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any
legal dispute, that (a) such Person is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason, (b) such Legal
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such court, (c) such
Persons property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such Legal
Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or (e) the venue of such Legal
Proceeding is improper. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third
party beneficiary hereby agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action,
claim, cause of action or suit other than before one of the above-named
courts, nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending
to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or
suit to any court other than one of the above-named courts, whether on the
grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to
service of process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware
law, and further consents to service of process by nationally recognized
overnight courier service guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to
_Section 9.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 9.8_, a party
hereto may commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit in a court
other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order
or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts. TO THE EXTENT NOT
PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE PARTIES AND
ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE,
SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON
ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE
TRANSACTIONS, AND THE CONSUMMATION THEREOF, AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING
THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY
TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS, AND THE CONSUMMATION THEREOF.
FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE
ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

 



 

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 



      
 

 



 

9.10 _Assignment_. No Party may assign, directly or indirectly, including by
operation of law, either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Parties.
Subject to the first sentence of this _Section 9.10_, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. In the
event any provision of any of the other Transaction Agreement in any way
conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement (except where a provision
therein expressly provides that it is intended to take precedence over this
Agreement), this Agreement shall control.

 



 

9.13 _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.

 



 

9.14 _No Recourse_. Other than the rights, at and after the Effective Time, of
Persons pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.4_ or _6.12_ , no Person who
is not a Party, including any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, consultant, incorporator, partner, manager, stockholder (including
the Company Stockholders), member, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative
or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Party, or any
current, former or future director, officer, employee, consultant,
incorporator, partner, manager, stockholder, member, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement and the Transactions, or based on, in respect of, or
by reason of this Agreement and the Transactions or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by
Applicable Legal Requirements, each Party hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements, (a) each Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Party or otherwise impose liability of a Party
on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of
equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single
business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or
otherwise, and (b) each Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty
Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

9.15 _Release_.

its Subsidiaries respective current and former officers, directors,

agreement or understanding or otherwise, at law or equity, arising out of or

Transactions without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
that no such consent or prior notice shall be required in connection with any
public announcement or press release the content of which is consistent with
that of any prior or contemporaneous public announcement or press release by
any Party in compliance with this _Section 9.15_. Nothing in this _Section
9.15_ shall limit any Party from making any announcements, statements or
acknowledgments that such Party is required by Applicable Legal Requirement or
the requirements of any national securities exchange to make, issue or
release; _provided further_ that, to the extent practicable, the Party making
such announcement, statement or acknowledgment shall provide such
announcement, statement or acknowledgment to the other Parties prior to
release and consider in good faith any comments from such other Parties.

 



 

9.17 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties in _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement and in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this

shall terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing.

Stockholder Approval and the consummation of the Merger.

creditors rights generally and the effect of general principles of equity,
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity.

 



 

5.2 _Ownership of the Company Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, such

Stockholders name.

 



 

5.3 _No Conflict; Consents_.

an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a material
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of
the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Stockholder pursuant to any
Contract to which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholder is
bound, except, in the case of clause (i) or (iii), as would not reasonably be
expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair the
ability of such Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person is

Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby.

A. On August 17, 2018, the Company, Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp.
(" _Parent")_ , Avista Healthcare Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") entered into an

things, provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company being the surviving entity of the Merger.

 



 

B. Sponsor agrees to enter into this Agreement with respect to all Class A
common stock of Parent, par value $0.0001 per share and Class B common stock
of Parent, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") that

13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act) or of record, subject to the terms of
the Parent Sponsor Letter between Sponsor, Avista Healthcare Public
Acquisition Corp. and certain of its directors, dated of even date herewith

2.2 _Additional Purchases_. Until the Expiration Time, Sponsor agrees that any
Parent Securities that Sponsor purchases or otherwise hereinafter acquires or

the operation of, any provision of this Agreement or (b) alleging a breach of
any fiduciary duty of any Person in connection with the evaluation,
negotiation or entry into the Merger Agreement.

 



 

5. _Representations and Warranties of Sponsor_. Sponsor hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Due Authority_. Sponsor has the full power and authority to make, enter
into and carry out the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Sponsor and constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of Sponsor enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited by the effect of
applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other
applicable Law affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and
the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 



 

5.2 _Ownership of Parent Common Stock_. As of the date hereof, Sponsor is the
owner of the shares of Parent Common Stock indicated on _Schedule A_ hereto
opposite Sponsors name, free and clear of any and all Liens, other than those
(i) created by this Agreement, or (ii) as disclosed on _Schedule A_. Sponsor

right to control such vote as contemplated herein), power of disposition,
power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth in this
Agreement and power to agree to all of the matters applicable to Sponsor set
forth in this Agreement, in each case, over all shares of Parent Common Stock

Sponsor Letter. As of the date hereof, Sponsor does not own any capital stock
or other voting securities of Parent other than the shares of Parent Common
Stock set forth on _Schedule A_ opposite Sponsors name. As of the date
hereof, Sponsor does not own any rights to purchase or acquire any shares of

performance by Sponsor of the obligations under this Agreement and the
compliance by Sponsor with any provisions hereof do not and will not: (i)

contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of any charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of
association, by-laws, operating agreement or similar formation or governing
documents and instruments of Sponsor, or (iii) result in any material breach
of or constitute a material default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a material default) under, or give to others any
rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien on any of the shares of Parent Common Stock owned by
Sponsor pursuant to any Contract to which Sponsor is a party or by which
Sponsor is bound, except, in the case of clause (i) or (iii), as would not
reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially
impair the ability of Sponsor to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person is
required by or with respect to Sponsor in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Sponsor of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Letter Agreement, dated October 10, 2016, among Parent, its officers and
directors and Sponsor, Sponsor has not: (i) entered into any voting agreement,
voting trust or similar agreement with respect to any Parent Common Stock or
other equity securities of Parent owned by Sponsor, or (ii) granted any proxy,
consent or power of attorney with respect to any Parent Common Stock or other
equity securities of Parent owned by Sponsor (other than as contemplated by
this Agreement).

 



 

6. _Fiduciary Duties_. The covenants and agreements set forth herein shall not prevent any of Sponsors designees serving on the board of directors of Parent from taking any action, subject to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, while acting in such designees capacity as a director of the Parent. Sponsor is entering into this Agreement solely in its capacity as the owner of Sponsors shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

7. _Termination_. Except as set forth herein with respect to specific provisions hereof, this Agreement shall not terminate and shall remain in full force and effect until fully performed by the parties hereto; _provided_ that this Agreement shall terminate at such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ thereof; _provided further_ that _Sections 2, 3_ and _5_ shall terminate and have no further force and effect immediately as of and following the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

8. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in the Company any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Sponsors shares of Parent Common Stock. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to Sponsors shares of Parent Common Stock shall remain vested in and belong to Sponsor, and the Company shall have no authority to direct Sponsor in the voting or disposition of any of the shares of Parent Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein.

10. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

10.1 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

10.2 _Non-survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement. This _Section

that by its terms is to be performed in whole or in part after the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

10.3 _Assignmen_ t. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation
of this _Section 10.3_ shall be void.

 



 

10.4 _Amendments and Modifications_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects by written
agreement signed by each of the parties hereto with respect to any of the
terms contained herein.

 



 

10.5 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and
covenants hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching
parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent or remedy breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof and to any further
equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which any
party is entitled under this Agreement. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any
such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which a party is entitled at law or in equity.

(a Delaware corporation)

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _Stockholders_

 



 

SECTION 1. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of stockholders of Avista
Healthcare Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Corporation_ "),
for the election of directors and for the transaction of such other business
as may properly come before the meeting shall be held each year at such date

of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ " or " _Board_ ") shall
determine.

 



 

SECTION 2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for the
transaction of such business as may properly come before the meeting may be
called by order of the Board of Directors or by stockholders holding together
at least a majority of all the shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at

SECTION 3. _Notice of Meetings_. Written notice of all meetings of the
stockholders, stating the place (if any), date and hour of the meeting, the

of stockholders may be examined, shall be mailed or delivered to each
stockholder not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting.
Notice of any special meeting shall state in general terms the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is to be held.

 



 

SECTION 4. _Stockholder Lists_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger
of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every
meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, either at a place within the city
where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice
of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to
be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder
who is present.

 



      
 

 



 

The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders
entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this section or the
books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
stockholders.

 



 

SECTION 5. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation, a quorum for the transaction of business at any
meeting of stockholders shall consist of the holders of record of a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy. At all
meetings of the stockholders at which a quorum is present, all matters, except
as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall be
decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote thereat present in person or by proxy. If there be no such quorum, the
holders of a majority of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without further notice, until a quorum shall have
been obtained. When a quorum is once present it is not broken by the
subsequent withdrawal of any stockholder.

 



 

SECTION 6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman, if any, or if none or in the Chairmans absence, the Vice-
Chairman, if any, or if none or in the Vice-Chairmans absence the President,
if any, or if none or in the Presidents absence, a Vice-President, or, if
none of the foregoing is present, by a chairman to be chosen by the
stockholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at the
meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in the Secretarys absence, the
presiding officer of the meeting shall appoint any person present to act as
secretary of the meeting.

 



 

SECTION 7. _Voting; Proxies; Required Vote_.

 



 

(a) At each meeting of stockholders, every stockholder shall be entitled to
vote in person or by proxy appointed by instrument in writing, subscribed by
such stockholder or by such stockholders duly authorized attorney-in-fact
(but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its
date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period), and, unless the
Certificate of Incorporation provides otherwise, shall have one vote for each
share of stock entitled to vote registered in the name of such stockholder on
the books of the Corporation on the applicable record date fixed pursuant to
these By-laws. At all elections of directors the voting may but need not be by
ballot and a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors shall elect. Except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate
of Incorporation, any other action shall be authorized by the vote of the
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

 



 

(b) Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of
stockholders may, except as otherwise required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of

 



      
 

 



 

record of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Corporation having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted, and the writing or writings are filed with the
permanent records of the Corporation. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate
action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given
to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

 



 

(c) Where a separate vote by a class or classes, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to vote on that
matter, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class or
classes present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the
act of such class, unless otherwise provided in the Corporations Certificate
of Incorporation.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Inspectors_. The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting,
may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the
meeting or any adjournment thereof. If an inspector or inspectors are not so
appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one
or more inspectors. In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector
fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the
directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding
thereat. Each inspector, if any, before entering upon the discharge of his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and
effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and
determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to
vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result,
and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness
to all stockholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the
inspector or inspectors, if any, shall make a report in writing of any
challenge, question or matter determined by such inspector or inspectors and
execute a certificate of any fact found by such inspector or inspectors.

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment

not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors and which record date shall not be more than
60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 



 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of

Directors and if no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required, shall be the first date on which a signed written
consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to

without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any

 



      
 

 



 

rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted and if no record date is fixed, the record date for determining

Directors, or the President or Vice-President, and by the Treasurer or an
Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.
Any and all signatures on any such certificate may be facsimiles. In case any
officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may
be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The name of the holder of
record of the shares represented thereby, with the number of such shares and
the date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation.

 



 

SECTION 2. _Transfers of Stock_. Upon compliance with provisions restricting
the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock, if any, shares of
capital stock shall be transferable on the books of the Corporation only by
the holder of record thereof in person, or by a duly authorized attorney, upon
surrender and cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares,
properly endorsed, and the payment of all taxes due thereon.

 



 

SECTION 3. _Fractional Shares_. The Corporation may, but shall not be required
to, issue certificates for fractions of a share where necessary to effect
authorized transactions, or the Corporation may pay in cash the fair value of
fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such
fractions are determined, or it may issue scrip in registered or bearer form
over the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the Corporation or of
its agent, exchangeable as therein provided for full shares, but such scrip
shall not entitle the holder to any rights of a stockholder except as therein
provided.

 



 

The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules
and regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and
registration of certificates representing shares of the Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation may issue
a new certificate of stock in place of any certificate, theretofore issued by
it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Board of Directors
may require the owner of any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance
of any such new certificate.

(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Corporation or to its stockholders, such Indemnified Party acting under these
By-laws shall not be liable to the Corporation or to its stockholders for its
good faith reliance on the provisions of these By-laws. The provisions of
these By-laws, to the extent that they restrict, modify or eliminate the
duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Party otherwise existing at law or in
equity, shall replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified
Party, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 3. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless and pay all judgments and claims against (i) the
Board of Directors (ii) each officer of the Corporation, (iii) each director
and (iv) each stockholder or their respective affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, partners, managers and members (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ", each of which shall be a third party beneficiary of
these By-laws solely for purposes of _Sections 3_ and _4_ of this _Article
VII_) from and against any loss or damage incurred by an Indemnified Party or
by the Corporation for any act or omission taken or suffered by such
Indemnified Party in good faith (including, without limitation, any act or
omission taken or suffered by any of them in reliance upon and in accordance
with the opinion or advice of experts, including, without limitation, of legal
counsel as to matters of law, of accountants as to matters of accounting, or
of investment bankers or appraisers as to matters of valuation) in connection
with the purpose and business of the Corporation, including costs and
reasonable attorneys fees and any amount expended in the settlement of any
claims or loss or damage, except with respect to (i) any act taken by such
Indemnified Party purporting to bind the Corporation that has not been
authorized pursuant to these By-laws or (ii) any act or omission with respect
to which such Indemnified Party was grossly negligent or engaged in
intentional misconduct.

 



 

(b) The satisfaction of any indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section
3(a)_ of this _Article VII_ shall be from and limited to Corporation assets
(including insurance and any agreements pursuant to which the Corporation, its
officers or employees are entitled to indemnification) and the stockholder, in
such capacity, shall not be subject to personal liability therefor.

 



 

(c) Expenses reasonably incurred by an Indemnified Party in defense or
settlement of any claim that may be subject to a right of indemnification
hereunder shall be advanced by the Corporation prior to the final disposition
thereof upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Party to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be determined upon
final adjudication after all possible appeals have been exhausted that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

 



 

(d) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of all
Indemnified Parties and other persons against any liability which may be
asserted against, or expense which may be incurred by, any such person in
connection with the Corporations activities, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such liabilities under
the provisions of these By-laws.

 



 

(e) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any investigation, action, suit, arbitration or other
proceeding, whether civil or criminal (collectively, " _Proceeding_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall, if a claim for indemnification in respect thereof is
to be made against the Corporation, give written notice to the Corporation of
the commencement of such Proceeding; _provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Corporation of its obligations under
this _Section 3_ of this _Article VII_, except to the extent that the
Corporation is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any
such Proceeding is brought against an Indemnified Party (other than a
derivative suit in right of the Corporation), the Corporation will be entitled
to participate in and to assume the defense thereof to the extent that the
Corporation may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. After notice from the Corporation to such Indemnified Party of the
Corporations election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the
Corporation will not be liable for expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. The Corporation will
not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of such
Proceeding that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability in respect of such Proceeding and the related claim.

 



 

(f) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in
this _Section 3_ of this _Article VII_ shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
agreement, bylaw, vote of the Board of Directors or otherwise. The rights
conferred upon any Indemnified Party in _Sections 2_ and _3_ of this _Article
VII_ shall be contract rights that vest upon the occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any act or omission giving rise to any proceeding or threatened
proceeding and such rights shall continue as to any Indemnified Party who has
ceased to be a manager, director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of
such Indemnified Partys heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment,
alteration or repeal of _Sections 2_ and _3_ of this _Article VII_ that
adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party or its successors shall
be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with
respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of
any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment,
alteration or repeal.

 



 

SECTION 4. _Primary Obligation_. With respect to any Indemnified Party who is
employed, retained or otherwise associated with, or appointed or nominated by
a stockholder or any of its affiliates and who acts or serves as a director,
officer, manager, fiduciary, employee, consultant, advisor or agent of, for or
to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, the Corporation or its
subsidiaries shall be primarily liable for all indemnification,
reimbursements, advancements or similar payments (the " _Indemnity
Obligations_ ") afforded to such Indemnified Party acting in such capacity or
capacities on behalf or at the request of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, in such capacity, whether the Indemnity Obligations are created
by law, organizational or constituent documents, contract (including these By-
laws) or otherwise. Notwithstanding the fact that such stockholder and/or any
of its affiliates, other than the Corporation (such persons, together with its
and their heirs, successors and assigns, the " _Stockholder Parties_ ") may
have concurrent liability to an Indemnified Party with respect to the
Indemnity Obligations, in no event shall the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries have any right or claim against any of the Stockholder Parties
for contribution or have rights of

 



      
 

 



 

subrogation against any of the Stockholder Parties through an Indemnified
Party for any payment made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries with
respect to any Indemnity Obligation. In addition, in the event that any
Stockholder Parties pay or advance to an Indemnified Party any amount with
respect to an Indemnity Obligation, the Corporation shall, or shall cause its
subsidiaries to, as applicable, promptly reimburse such Stockholder Party for
such payment or advance upon request.

 



 

SECTION 5. _Continuing Obligation_. The provisions of this _Article VII_
shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director of
the Corporation who serves in such capacity at any time while these By-laws
are in effect, and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any
rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or
theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or
thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.

 



 

SECTION 6. _Nonexclusive_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided for under this _Article VII_ shall (i) not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise,
both as to action in their official capacities and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, (ii) continue unto a person who has ceased
to be a director and (iii) inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

 



 

SECTION 7. _Other Persons_. In addition to the indemnification rights of
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Corporation, the Board of
Directors in its discretion shall have the power, on behalf of the
Corporation, to indemnify any other person made a party to any action, suit or
proceeding who the Corporation may indemnify under Section 145 of the DGCL.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Definitions_. The phrases and terms set forth in this _Article
VII_ shall be given the same meaning as the identical terms and phrases are
given in Section 145 of the DGCL, as that Section may be amended and
supplemented from time to time.

whole or any part of such funds of the Corporation shall rest wholly within
the lawful discretion of the Board of Directors, and it shall not be required

 **FORM CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**

 



 

 **CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
OF**

 

 **AVISTA HEALTHCARE PUBLIC ACQUISITION CORP.**

 



 

I, the undersigned, for the purposes of incorporating and organizing a
corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), do execute this certificate of incorporation and do hereby certify
as follows:

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE I_**

 



 

1.1 _Name._ The name of the Corporation is:

 



 

Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE II_**

 



 

2.1 _Address._ The address of the Corporations registered office in the
State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, County of
New Castle, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent for service of
process in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service
Company.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE III_**

 



 

3.1 _Purpose._ The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized and incorporated under the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Corporation shall
have all of the powers conferred on corporations by the DGCL and other
applicable law. The Corporation is being incorporated in connection with the
domestication of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands
exempted company (" _Avista Healthcare Cayman_ "), as a Delaware corporation
(the " _Domestication_ "), and this Certificate of Incorporation is being

 ** _ARTICLE IV_**

 



 

4.1 _Authorized Shares_. The total number of shares of all classes of capital
stock, each with a par value of $0.0001 per share, which the Corporation is
authorized to issue is 221,000,000 shares, consisting of (a) 220,000,000
shares of common stock (" _Common Stock_ "), including (i) 200,000,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock (" _Class A Common Stock_") and (ii) 20,000,000
shares of Class B Common Stock (" _Class B Common Stock_"); and (b) 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock (" _Preferred Stock_ "). Upon the effectiveness of
the Domestication (the " _Effective Time_ "), any stock certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented Original Class A Shares
or Original Class B Shares will, from and after the Effective Time,
automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange,
represented an identical number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock (respectively) of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the rights and preferences of the Common Stock
shall at all times be subject to the rights and preferences of the Preferred
Stock as may be set forth in one or more certificates of designations filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware from time to time in
accordance with the DGCL and this Certificate. The

 



      
 

 



 

number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock may be
increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then
outstanding) from time to time by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of the Corporations then outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class,
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any
successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common
Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class or series shall be
required therefor.

 



 

4.2 _Common Stock._ The Common Stock shall have the following powers,
designations, preferences and rights and qualifications, limitations and
restrictions:

 



 

(a) Each holder of record of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to vote
at all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation and shall have one vote
for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder of record as of
the applicable record date on any matter that is submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the fullest
extent permitted by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall have no
voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any
amendment to this Certificate (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the
terms of one or more outstanding series or class(es) of Preferred Stock if the
holders of such affected series or class(es) of Preferred Stock are entitled,
either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such
series or class(es), to vote thereon pursuant to applicable law or this
Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any series
or class of Preferred Stock); _and provided further_ that the Board of
Directors may issue or grant shares of Common Stock that are subject to
vesting or forfeiture and that restrict or eliminate voting rights with
respect to such shares until any such vesting criteria is satisfied or such
forfeiture provisions lapse.

 



 

(b) Subject to the prior rights of all classes or series of stock at the time
outstanding having prior rights as to dividends or other distributions, the
holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends
and other distributions in cash, property, or stock as may be declared on the
Common Stock by the Board of Directors from time to time out of assets or
funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall share equally on
a per share basis in all such dividends and other distributions.

 



 

(c) Subject to the prior rights of creditors of the Corporation and the
holders of all classes or series of stock at the time outstanding having prior
rights as to distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive their ratable and proportionate share of
the remaining assets of the Corporation.

 



 

(d) No holder of shares of Common Stock shall have cumulative voting rights.

 



 

(e) No holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to preemptive or
subscription rights pursuant to this Certificate.

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 _Class B Common Stock_

 



 

(a) Effective upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the issued
and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall automatically be
converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the case that additional shares of Class A Common
Stock or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in
excess of the amount sold in the IPO and related to or in connection with the
consummation of the Business Combination, all issued and outstanding shares of
Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into shares of Class A Common
Stock at a ratio for which:

 



 

(i) the numerator shall be equal to the sum of (A) 25% of all shares of Class
A Common Stock issued or issuable (upon the conversion or exercise of any
equity-linked securities or otherwise) by the Corporation, related to or in
connection with the consummation of the Business Combination (excluding any
securities issued or issuable to any seller in the Business Combination) plus
(B) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding prior
to the consummation of the Business Combination; and

 



 

(ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

 



 

(b) The foregoing conversion ratio shall also be adjusted to account for any
subdivision (by share split, subdivision, exchange, share dividend, rights
issue, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by
reverse share split, share consolidation, exchange, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) or similar reclassification or recapitalization
of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or
lesser number of shares occurring after October 12, 2016 without a
proportionate and corresponding subdivision, combination or similar
reclassification or recapitalization of the outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock.

 



 

(c) Each share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into its pro rata number
of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.3. The pro rata
share for each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock will be determined as
follows: each Share of Class B Common Stock shall convert into such number of
shares of Class A Common Stock as is equal to the product of 1 multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Class
A Common Stock into which all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be converted pursuant to this Certificate and the
denominator of which shall be the total number of issued and outstanding
shares of Class B Common Stock at the time of conversion.

 



 

(d) At any time when there are no longer any shares of Class B Common Stock
outstanding, this Certificate automatically shall be deemed amended to delete
this Section 4.3 in its entirety.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.3, in no event
may any Share of Class B Common Stock convert into shares of Class A Common
Stock at a ratio that is less than one-for-one.

 



 

4.4 _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized,
to the fullest extent as may now or hereafter be permitted by the DGCL, by
resolution or resolutions, at any time and from time to time, to provide for
the issuance of a share or shares of Preferred Stock

 



      
 

 



 

in one or more series or classes and to fix for each such series or class (i)
the number of shares constituting such series or class and the designation of
such series or class, (ii) the voting powers (if any), whether full or
limited, of the shares of such series or class, (iii) the powers, preferences,
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the shares of
each such series or class, and (iv) the qualifications, limitations, and
restrictions thereof, and to cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a certificate of designation with respect thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent as may
now or hereafter be permitted by the DGCL, the authority of the Board of
Directors with respect to the Preferred Stock and any series or class thereof
shall include, but not be limited to, determination of the following:

 



 

(a) the number of shares constituting any series or class, which number the
Board of Directors may thereafter increase or decrease (but not below the
number of shares thereof then outstanding) and the distinctive designation of
that series or class;

 



 

(b) the dividend rate or rates on the shares of any series or class, the terms
and conditions upon which and the periods in respect of which dividends shall
be payable, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, from which date
or dates, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of dividends
on shares of that series or class;

 



 

(c) whether any series or class shall have voting rights, in addition to the
voting rights provided by applicable law, and, if so, the number of votes per
share and the terms and conditions of such voting rights;

 



 

(d) whether any series or class shall have conversion privileges and, if so,
the terms and conditions of conversion, including provision for adjustment of
the conversion rate upon such events as the Board of Directors shall
determine;

 



 

(e) whether the shares of any series or class shall be redeemable and, if so,
the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the date or dates upon
or after which they shall be redeemable and the amount per share payable in
case of redemption, which amount may vary under different conditions and at
different redemption dates;

 



 

(f) whether any series or class shall have a sinking fund for the redemption
or purchase of shares of that series or class, and, if so, the terms and
amount of such sinking fund;

 



 

(g) the rights of the shares of any series or class in the event of voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and
the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of shares of that series
or class; and

 



 

(h) any other powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations, and
restrictions of any series or class.

 



 

The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other
special rights of the shares of each series or class of Preferred Stock, and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ
from those of any and all other series or classes at any time outstanding.
Unless otherwise provided in the resolution or resolutions providing for the
issuance of such series or class of Preferred Stock, shares of Preferred
Stock, regardless of series or class,

 



      
 

 



 

which shall be issued and thereafter acquired by the Corporation through
purchase, redemption, exchange, conversion or otherwise shall return to the
status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock, without designation as to
series or class of Preferred Stock, and the Corporation shall have the right
to reissue such shares.

 



 

4.5 _Power to Sell and Purchase Shares_. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to issue and sell all or
any part of any shares of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to
such persons, and for such consideration and for such corporate purposes, as
the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its discretion, determine,
whether or not greater consideration could be received upon the issue or sale
of the same number of shares of another class, and as otherwise permitted by
law. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation shall
have the power to purchase any shares of any class of stock herein or
hereafter authorized from such persons, and for such consideration and for
such corporate purposes, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in
its discretion, determine, whether or not less consideration could be paid
upon the purchase of the same number of shares of another class, and as
otherwise permitted by law.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE V_**

 



 

5.1 _Powers of the Board._ The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition
to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by applicable law or
by this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series or class of Preferred Stock) or the Bylaws of the Corporation (the "
_Bylaws_ "), the Board of Directors is hereby empowered to exercise all such
powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the
Corporation, except as otherwise specifically required by law or as otherwise
provided in this Certificate (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series or class of Preferred Stock).

 



 

5.2 _Number of Directors._ Upon the Effective Time, the total number of
directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be eight (8).
Thereafter, the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of
Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively
by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
directors then in office.

 



 

5.3 _Removal of Directors._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series
or classes of Preferred Stock, any director or the entire Board of Directors
may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes which all
the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of
directors, voting together as a single class. For purposes of this Section
5.3, "cause" shall mean, with respect to any director, (i) the willful failure
by such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such director in
performing, the duties of a director, (ii) the engaging by such director in
willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation or (iii)
the conviction of such director of, or the entering by such director of a plea
of _nolo contendere_ to, a crime that constitutes a felony.

 



 

5.4 _Term._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series or classes of
Preferred Stock, and effective upon the Effective Time, the term of office of
each director shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders
following the Effective Time and thereafter at the first annual

 



      
 

 



 

meeting of the stockholders following the annual meeting of the stockholders
at which such director was elected. Directors shall be elected by a plurality
of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at a
meeting and voting for nominees in the election of directors. A director shall
hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term
expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify,
subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement or removal from
office. A director may resign at any time upon written notice to the
Corporation.

 



 

5.5 _Vacancies._ Subject to the terms of any one or more series or classes
of Preferred Stock or the designation rights of certain stockholders pursuant
to the terms of any stockholders agreements, any vacancies in the Board of
Directors for any reason and any newly created directorships resulting by
reason of any increase in the number of directors shall be filled only by the
Board of Directors (and not by the stockholders), acting by a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director, and any directors so appointed shall hold office until the
next election of the class of directors to which such directors have been
appointed and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

 



 

5.6 _Director Elections by Holders of Preferred Stock._ Notwithstanding the
foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series or classes of
Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by series or class, to

more series or classes of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the

Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, this Certificate or the Bylaws of
the Corporation, and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be
specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the votes which all the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any

DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, no director of the
Corporation shall have any personal liability to the Corporation or any of its
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to permit the further elimination
or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended, without further action by the
Corporation. Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Section
7.1, or adoption of any provision of this Certificate (including any
certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred
Stock) inconsistent with this Section 7.1, shall not reduce, eliminate or
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
existing at the time of such alteration, amendment, addition to, repeal or
adoption with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.

 



 

7.2 _Indemnification and Advancement._ The Corporation shall indemnify,
advance expenses to and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person
(Indemnitee) who was or is made or is threatened

 



      
 

 



 

to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution
mechanism, investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual,
threatened or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the
Corporation or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or
unintentional tort claims), criminal, administrative or investigative (formal
or informal) nature, including appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is,
will or might be involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or
otherwise by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, by reason of any action (or failure to
act) taken by him or her of any action (or failure to act) on his or her part
while acting as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or
by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member,
fiduciary, employee or agent of any other Enterprise, in each case whether or
not serving in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred
for which indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of expenses can be
provided under this Section 7.2. " _Enterprise_ " means the Corporation and
any other corporation, constituent corporation (including any constituent of a

enterprise, of which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member,
fiduciary, employee or agent.

 



 

7.3 _Nonexclusivity of Rights; Sponsors Directors._

 



 

(a) The rights conferred on any Indemnitee by this Article VII shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter
acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the
Bylaws, any agreement, or pursuant to any vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

(b) The Corporation hereby acknowledges that the directors that are partners
or employees of the Sponsors (" _Sponsors Directors_ ") have certain rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by the
Sponsors and certain affiliates that, directly or indirectly, (i) are
controlled by, (ii) control or (iii) are under common control with, the
Sponsors (collectively, the " _Fund Indemnitors_ "). The Corporation hereby
agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort ( _i.e._ , its
obligations to the Sponsors Directors are primary and any obligation of the
Fund Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Sponsors Directors are
secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the Sponsors Directors and shall be liable for the full
amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in
settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of
this paragraph and the bylaws of the Corporation from time to time (or any
other agreement between the Corporation and the Sponsors Directors), without
regard to any rights the Sponsors Directors may have against the Fund
Indemnitors, and (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases
the Fund Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Fund Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no advancement or payment by the
Fund Indemnitors on behalf of the Sponsors Directors with respect to any claim
for which the Sponsors Directors have sought indemnification from the
Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Fund Indemnitors shall have a
right of contribution and/or to be

 



      
 

 



 

subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the Sponsors Directors against the Corporation. The Corporation
and the Sponsors Directors agree that the Fund Indemnitors are express third
party beneficiaries of the terms of this paragraph.

 



 

7.4 _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any Indemnitee in respect of any act or omission
occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

 



 

7.5 _Other Indemnification and Prepayment of Expenses_. This Article VII shall
not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than
Indemnitees when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action.

 



 

7.6 _Change in Rights._ Neither any amendment nor repeal of this Article VII,
nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate inconsistent with this
Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in
respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VIII_**

 



 

8.1 _Delaware._ Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the
State of Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide. The books of the Corporation
may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State
of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by
the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE IX_**

 



 

9.1 _Amendments to Bylaws._ In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of
Directors is expressly authorized and empowered to make, alter, amend, add to
or repeal any and all Bylaws of the Corporation by a majority of the directors
then in office. The stockholders may not adopt, amend, alter or repeal the
Bylaws of the Corporation, or adopt any provision inconsistent therewith,
unless such action is approved, in addition to any other vote required by this
Certificate, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the votes that all the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual
election of directors, voting together as a single class. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of law, this Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation,
and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law,
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes which
all the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or
repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article IX.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE X_**

 



 

10.1 _Corporate Opportunities._ To the fullest extent permitted by Section
122(17) of the DGCL and except as may be otherwise expressly agreed in writing
by the Corporation and any of the Sponsors, the Corporation, on behalf of
itself and its subsidiaries, renounces any interest or expectancy of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, business opportunities, which are from time to time presented
to the Sponsors or

 



      
 

 



 

any of their managers, officers, directors, agents, stockholders, members,
partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than the Corporation and its
subsidiaries), even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its
subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or
desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and no such person or
entity shall be liable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for
breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise,
by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such
business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or
entity or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding
such business opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries unless, in
the case of any such person who is a director or officer of the Corporation,
such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in
writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Corporation. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate (including
any certificate of designations relating to any series or class of Preferred
Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate or reduce the effect
of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity first identified or
any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but
for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.

 



 

10.2 _Amendments to Article X_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation, for as long as the Sponsors
and their affiliates collectively beneficially own shares of stock of the
Corporation representing at least 5% of the Corporations then outstanding
shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, this Article X
shall not be amended, altered or revised, including by merger or otherwise,
without the Sponsors prior written consent.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XI_**

 



 

11.1 _Forum._ Unless the Corporation consents in writing in advance to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (B) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary
duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any director, officer or employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (C) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this
Certificate (including as it may be amended from time to time), or the Bylaws,
(D) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of this
Certificate or the Bylaws, or (E) any action asserting a claim governed by the
internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each of (A) through (E) above,
any claim as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an
indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such
determination). To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity
purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to
the provisions of this Article XI.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XII_**

 



 

12.1 _Amendment._ The Corporation reserves the right, at any time and from
time to time, to alter, amend, add to or repeal any provision contained in
this Certificate (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series or class of Preferred Stock) in any manner now or hereafter prescribed
by the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights, preferences, privileges
and powers of any nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XIII_**

 



 

13.1 _Severability._ If any provision (or any part thereof) of this
Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever: (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate including, without limitation, each
portion of any section of this Certificate containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby
and (ii) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Certificate
(including, without limitation, each such containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to permit
the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and agents from
personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for the benefit
of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 ** _STOCKHOLDERS_**

 



 

Section 1.01. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the stockholders of
Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. (the " _Corporation_ ") for the
election of directors and for the transaction of such other business as
properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such place, either
within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ " or "
_Board_ "), and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of
Directors may adopt, by means of remote communication as authorized by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and at such
date and at such time as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the
Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the
meeting.

 



 

Section 1.02. _Special Meetings_. Subject to the terms of any one or more
series or classes of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of
the Corporation, for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time, but
only by or at the direction of a majority of the directors then in office, the
Chairperson or co-Chairpersons of the Board of Directors or the Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation. The ability of stockholders to call a
special meeting of stockholders is specifically denied. Any such special
meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without
the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of
Directors, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of
Directors may adopt, by means of remote communication as authorized by the
DGCL, as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice
thereof.

 



 

Section 1.03. _No Stockholder Action by Consent_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected
by a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be
effected by written consent of the stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.04. _Notice of Meetings; Waiver_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise prescribed by statute or the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Certificate
of Incorporation_ "), the Secretary of the Corporation or any Assistant
Secretary shall cause written notice of the place, if any, date and hour of
each meeting of

 



      
 

 



 

the stockholders, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which such meeting is called, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting, to be given personally by mail
or by electronic transmission, or as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, not
fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, or in
the case of a meeting called for the purpose of acting upon a merger or
consolidation not fewer than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days prior
to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such
meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given
personally to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on
the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if a stockholder shall have
filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to
such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such
stockholder at such other address. If such notice is delivered (rather than
mailed) to the stockholders address, the notice shall be deemed to be given
when delivered. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.

 



 

(b) A written waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by
the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a written waiver of notice.
Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.

 



 

(c) For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be
effective, such stockholder must consent to the Corporations giving notice by
that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke
consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the
Corporation. A stockholders consent to notice by electronic transmission is
automatically revoked if the Corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive
electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the
Secretary of the Corporation, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or
other person responsible for giving notice.

 



 

(d) Notices are deemed given (i) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where
the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail,
when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (iii) if by posting on an
electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate
notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of
(A) such posting or (B) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or
(iv) if by any other form of electronic communication, when directed to the
stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If a stockholder meeting is to be held by means of remote communication
and stockholders will take action at such meeting, the notice of such meeting
must: (i) specify the means of remote communication, if any, by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such
meeting; and (ii) provide the information required to access the stockholder
list. A waiver of notice may be given by electronic transmission.

 



 

Section 1.05. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in
person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of
the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting; it being understood
that to the extent the Board of Directors issues or grants any shares that are
subject to vesting or forfeiture and restrict or eliminate voting rights with
respect to such shares until such vesting criteria is satisfied or such
forfeiture provisions lapse, any such unvested shares shall not be considered
to have the power to vote at a meeting of stockholders. Where a separate vote
by one or more classes or series is required, the presence in person or by
proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of the shares
entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to that vote on that matter. Shares of its own stock belonging to the
Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to
vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly
or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ , however, that the foregoing shall
not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to
vote stock, including, but not limited to, its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

 



 

Section 1.06. _Voting_.

 



 

(a) If, pursuant to Section 5.05 of these Bylaws, a record date has been
fixed, every holder of record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall, subject to the terms of any one or more series or classes
of Preferred Stock, be entitled to one (1) vote for each share outstanding in
his or her name on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on
such record date. If no record date has been fixed, then every holder of
record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall, subject
to the terms of any one or more series or classes of Preferred Stock, be
entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock standing in his or her name
on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws (including Sections 2.13), (i) directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at a meeting and voting for nominees in the election of directors and (ii) all
other matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes properly cast for or against such

 



      
 

 



 

matter, and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither abstentions nor broker non-
votes shall be counted as votes cast for or against such matter.

 



 

Section 1.07. _Voting by Ballot_. No vote of the stockholders on an election
of directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic transmission
unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by
law. Any vote not required to be taken by ballot or by electronic transmission
may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors prior to the
meeting at which such vote is taken.

 



 

Section 1.08. _Postponement and Adjournment_. Any meeting of stockholders may
be postponed by action of the Board of Directors at any time in advance of
such meeting. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders,
the Chairperson or co-Chairpersons of such meeting shall have the power to
adjourn the meeting without a vote of the stockholders. Notice of any
adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if
the place, if any, date and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which
the adjournment is taken, _provided_ , however, that if the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for
the adjourned meeting is fixed pursuant to Section 5.05 of these Bylaws, a
notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section
1.04 of these Bylaws, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at such meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present,
any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original
date of the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.09. _Proxies_. Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such
meeting and express such vote on behalf of him or her by proxy. A stockholder
may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument signed by such
stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing
by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature,
or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or
other means of electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder
of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. Such proxy
must be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of
the meeting at which such proxy will be voted. No such proxy shall be voted or
acted upon after the expiration of three (3) years from the date of such
proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock
itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument
in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date. Proxies by telegram, cablegram, facsimile or other electronic
transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which
it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram, facsimile or other
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission
created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the
original writing or

the entire original writing or transmission.

 



 

Section 1.10. _Organization; Procedure_. At every meeting of stockholders, the
Chairperson or co-Chairpersons of the Board shall be the Chairperson(s) of the
meeting or, if the Chairperson or co-Chairpersons of the Board have not been
elected or in the event of their absence or disability, the Chairperson or co-
Chairpersons chosen by the Board of Directors shall be the Chairperson(s) of
the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in the event of his or her
absence or disability, an Assistant Secretary, if any, or if there be no
Assistant Secretary, in the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, an
appointee of the Chairperson(s) of the meeting, shall act as Secretary of the
meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at every
meeting of stockholders may be determined by the Chairperson(s) of such
meeting.

 



 

Section 1.11. _Business at Annual and Special Meetings_. No business may be
transacted at an annual or special meeting of stockholders other than business
that is:

 



 

(a) specified in a notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee
thereof,

 



 

(b) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof or any authorized officer
of the Corporation to whom the Board of Directors or such committee shall have
delegated such authority, or

 



 

(c) otherwise brought before the meeting by a "Noticing Stockholder" who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.12 of these Bylaws.

 



 

A " _Noticing Stockholder_ " must be either a "Record Holder" or a "Nominee
Holder." A " _Record Holder_ " is a stockholder that holds of record stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on the business (including any
election of a director) to be appropriately conducted at the meeting. A "
_Nominee Holder_ " is a stockholder that holds such stock through a nominee or
"street name" holder of record and can demonstrate to the Corporation such
indirect ownership of such stock and such Nominee Holders entitlement to vote
such stock on such business. Clause (c) of this Section 1.11 shall be the
exclusive means for a Noticing Stockholder to make director nominations or
submit other business before a meeting of stockholders (other than proposals
brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the
Corporations notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these
Bylaws). Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at a stockholders meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 1.11 and Section 1.12 of these Bylaws.

 



 

Section 1.12. _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_. In order for a
Noticing Stockholder to properly bring any item of business before a meeting
of

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders, the Noticing Stockholder must give timely notice thereof in
writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with the
requirements of this Section 1.12. This Section 1.12 shall constitute an
"advance notice provision" for annual meetings for purposes of Rule
14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(a) To be timely, a Noticing Stockholders notice shall be delivered to the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation:

 



 

(i) in the case of an annual meeting of stockholders, not earlier than the
close of business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day and not later than
the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in
the event the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before
or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the one-hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the date of such
annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first
public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than one
hundred (100) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the tenth (10th)
day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting
is first made by the Corporation;

 



 

(ii) in the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose
of electing directors, not earlier than the close of business on the one-
hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the date on which notice of
the date of the special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of
the special meeting was made, whichever first occurs;

 



 

(iii) in no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual or
special meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for
the giving of a stockholders notice as described above; and

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding anything in Sections 1.12(a)(i) and (ii) to the contrary,
in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of
Directors is increased and there has been no public announcement naming all of
the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the size of the Board
of Directors made by the Corporation at least ten (10) days before the last
day a Noticing Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance
with Sections 1.12(a)(i) and (ii), a Noticing Stockholders notice required by
this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees
for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than
the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such
public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

Stockholder Associated Person of the Noticing Stockholder shall in all events
be deemed to beneficially own any shares of any class or series of the
Corporation as to which such Holder or Stockholder Associated Person of the
Noticing Stockholder has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time
in the future) and the date such ownership was acquired;

 



 

(C) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or
similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment
or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the
Corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the price, value
or volatility of any class or series of shares of the Corporation, whether or
not the instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise (a "
_Derivative Instrument_ ") that is directly or indirectly owned beneficially
by the Holder or any Stockholder Associated Person of the Noticing Stockholder
and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit
derived from any increase or decrease in the price, value or volatility of

partner, is the manager, managing member or directly or indirectly
beneficially owns an interest in the manager or managing member of a limited
liability company or similar entity;

 



 

(H) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that the
Holder or any Stockholder Associated Person of the Noticing Stockholder is

(M) any other information as reasonably requested by the Corporation.

 



 

Such information shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be
supplemented by the Holder not later than ten (10) days after the record date
for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date.

 



 

(ii) If the notice relates to any business other than a nomination of a
director or directors that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, the notice must set forth:

 



 

(A) a reasonably detailed description of the business desired to be brought

(B) all information relating to the nominee (including, without limitation,
the nominees name, age, business and residence address and principal
occupation or employment and the class or series and number of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by
the nominee) that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies
for election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (including such
persons written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee
and to serving as a director if elected);

 



      
 

 



 

(C) a description of any agreements, arrangements and understandings between
or among such stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person, on the one

as a director; and

 



 

(D) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material
monetary agreements, arrangements, and understandings during the past three
years, and any other material relationships, between or among the Holder and
respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith,
on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective
affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other
hand, including, without limitation all information that would be required to
be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K if the Holder making the
nomination or on whose behalf the nomination is made, if any, or any affiliate
or associate thereof or person acting in concert therewith, were the
"registrant" for purposes of Item 404 and the nominee were a director or
executive officer of such registrant.

 



 

(iv) with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of
Directors, the Noticing Stockholder shall include a completed and signed
questionnaire, representation, and agreement required by Section 1.13 of these
Bylaws. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the
eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the
Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of the nominee.

 



 

(c) For purposes of these Bylaws:

 



 

(i) " _public announcement_ " shall mean disclosure in a press release
reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the
Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section
13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

 



 

(ii) " _Stockholder Associated Person_ " means, with respect to any
stockholder, (A) any person acting in concert with such stockholder, (B) any
beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation owned of record or
beneficially by such stockholder (other than a stockholder that is a
depositary) and (C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with any stockholder, or any Stockholder Associated Person identified
in clauses (A) or (B) above; and

 



 

(iii) " _Affiliate_ " and " _Associate_ " are defined by reference to Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act. An "affiliate" is any "person that directly, or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by,
or

 



      
 

 



 

is under common control with, the person specified." " _Control_ " is defined
as the "possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management policies of a person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise." The term "
_associate_ " of a person means: (i) any corporation or organization (other
than the registrant or a majority-owned subsidiary of the registrant) of which
such person is an officer or partner or is, directly or indirectly, the
beneficial owner of ten (10) percent or more of any class of equity
securities, (ii) any trust or other estate in which such person has a
substantial beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as trustee
or in a similar fiduciary capacity, and (iii) any relative or spouse of such
person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same home as such person
or who is a director or officer of the registrant or any of its parents or
subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Except for (1) any directors entitled to be elected by the holders of
preferred stock, (2) any directors elected in accordance with Section 2.13
hereof by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy or newly-created
directorship or, (3) any directors designated by certain stockholders pursuant
to the terms of any stockholders agreements or (4) as otherwise required by
applicable law or stock exchange regulation, at any meeting of stockholders,
only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors. Only such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in
these Bylaws, provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought
before the meeting in accordance with Section 1.12, nothing in this Section
1.12(d) shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of such
business. If any information submitted pursuant to this Section 1.12 by any
stockholder proposing a nominee(s) for election as a director at a meeting of
stockholders is inaccurate in any material respect, such information shall be
deemed not to have been provided in accordance with Section 1.12. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws,
the Chairperson or co-Chairpersons of the meeting shall have the power and
duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought
before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in compliance
with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if he or she should
determine that any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with
these Bylaws, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such
nomination or business not properly brought before the meeting shall be
disregarded or not be transacted.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these Bylaws, a Noticing
Stockholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws
to the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder are not intended to and shall not
limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other
business to be considered pursuant to Section 1.11 or Section 1.12 of these
Bylaws.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to (i) affect any rights of (A)
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (B) the holders of
any series or class of Preferred Stock, if any, if so provided under any
applicable certificate of designation for such Preferred Stock or in the
Certificate or Incorporation, or (ii) affect any rights of any holders of
common stock pursuant to a stockholders agreement or impose any requirements,
restrictions or limitations under Sections 1.11, 1.12 or 1.13 of these Bylaws
unless expressly imposed by any such stockholders agreement.

 



 

Section 1.13. _Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreement_. To
be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the
Corporation by a Holder, a person must complete and deliver (in accordance
with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Section 1.12 of
these Bylaws) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation a written questionnaire providing the information requested about
the background and qualifications of such person and the background of any
other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made and a
written representation and agreement (the questionnaire, representation, and
agreement to be in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request)
that such person:

 



 

(a) is not and will not become a party to:

 



 

(i) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any
commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how the person, if
elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or
question (a " _Voting Commitment_ ") that has not been disclosed to the
Corporation, or

 



 

(ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the persons
ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with the
persons fiduciary duties under applicable law,

 



 

(b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with
respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement or
indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has
not been disclosed to the Corporation, and

 



 

(c) in the persons individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity
on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if
elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable
publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality
and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.14. _Inspectors of Elections_. Preceding any meeting of the
stockholders, the Board of Directors shall appoint one (1) or more persons to
act as "inspectors" of elections, and may designate one (1) or more alternate
inspectors. In the

 



      
 

 



 

event no inspector or alternate is able to act, the Chairperson or co-
Chairpersons of such meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspectors to act
at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the
duties of an inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his
or her ability. The inspector shall:

 



 

(a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each;

 



 

(b) determine the shares represented at a meeting, the authenticity, validity,

(c) specify the information relied upon to determine the validity of
electronic transmissions in accordance with Section 1.09 of these Bylaws;

the meeting, and his or her count of all votes and ballots;

 



 

(g) appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist in the performance
of the duties of inspector;

ballots, be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted
with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with Section 1.09
of these Bylaws, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation.
The inspector may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose
of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers
or their nominees or a similar person which represent more votes than the
holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than
the stockholder holds of record. If the inspector considers other reliable
information as outlined in this section, the inspector, at the time of his or
her certification pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall specify the
precise information considered, the person or persons from whom the
information was obtained, when this information was obtained, the means by
which the information was obtained, and the basis for the inspectors belief
that such information is accurate and reliable; and

 



 

(i) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with
fairness to all stockholders.

 



 

Section 1.15. _Opening and Closing of Polls_. The date and time for the
opening and the closing of the polls for each matter to be voted upon at a
stockholder meeting shall be fixed by the Chairperson(s) of the meeting and
announced at the meeting. The

 



      
 

 



 

inspector shall be prohibited from accepting any ballots, proxies or votes or
any revocations thereof or changes thereto after the closing of the polls,
unless the Delaware Court of Chancery upon application by a stockholder shall
determine otherwise.

 



 

Section 1.16. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting either (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Corporations
principal executive office. In the event that the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting.

 



 

Section 1.17. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 1.16 of this Article I or the books of
the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

Directors shall be such number as may be fixed from time to time exclusively
by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of at

 



      
 

 



 

least a majority of the directors then in office. No reduction of the
authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director
before that directors term of office expires. At any meeting of stockholders
at which directors are to be elected, directors shall be elected by the
plurality vote of the votes cast by the holders of shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Election of

time determine, and if so determined notice thereof need not be given. Notice
of such annual meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given. The Board
of Directors from time to time may by resolution provide for the holding of
regular meetings and fix the place (which may be within or without the State

of such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,
except that, in the case of one-member committees, the presence of one member
shall constitute a quorum and in the case of two-member committees, the
presence of two members shall constitute a quorum. The act of the majority of
the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the

meeting of any committee may be taken without a meeting, if all members of
such committee shall consent to such action in writing or by electronic
transmission and such writing, writings or electronic transmission or
transmissions are filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the committee.

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 ** _CAPITAL STOCK_**

 



 

Section 5.01. _Certificates of Stock_. The Board of Directors may authorize
that some or all of the shares of any or all of the Corporations classes or
series of stock be evidenced by a certificate or certificates of stock. The
Board of Directors may also authorize the issue of some or all of the shares
of any or all of the Corporations classes or series of stock without
certificates. The rights and obligations of stockholders with the same class
and/or series of stock shall be identical whether or not their shares are
represented by certificates.

 



 

(a) _Shares with Certificates_. If the Board of Directors chooses to issue
shares of stock evidenced by a certificate or certificates, each individual
certificate shall include the following on its face: (i) the Corporations
name, (ii) the fact that the Corporation is organized under the laws of
Delaware, (iii) the name of the person to whom the certificate is issued, (iv)
the number of shares represented thereby, (v) the class of shares and the
designation of the series, if any, which the certificate represents, and (vi)
such other information as applicable law may require or as may be lawful. If
the Corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or
different series within a class, the designations, relative rights,
preferences and limitations determined for each series (and the authority of
the Board of Directors to determine variations for future series) shall be
summarized on the front or back of each certificate. Alternatively, each
certificate shall state on its front or back that the Corporation will furnish
the stockholder this information in writing, without charge, upon request.
Each certificate of stock issued by the Corporation shall be signed (either
manually or in facsimile) by any two officers of the Corporation. If the
person who signed a certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is
issued, the certificate is nonetheless valid.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) _Shares without Certificates_. If the Board of Directors chooses to issue
shares of stock without certificates, the Corporation, if required by the
Exchange Act, shall, within a reasonable time after the issue or transfer of
shares without certificates, send the stockholder a written notice containing
the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to
the laws of the DGCL. The Corporation may adopt a system of issuance,
recordation and transfer of its shares of stock by electronic or other means
not involving the issuance of certificates, provided the use of such system by
the Corporation is permitted in accordance with applicable law.

 



 

Section 5.02. _Signatures; Facsimile_. All signatures on the certificate
referred to in Section 5.01 of these Bylaws may be in facsimile, engraved or
printed form, to the extent permitted by law. In case any officer, transfer
agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile, engraved or printed
signature has been placed upon a certificate, shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may
be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 



 

Section 5.03. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. Except as provided in
this Section 5.03, no new share certificates for shares shall be issued to
replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to
the Corporation and cancelled at the same time. The Board of Directors may
direct that a new certificate be issued in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon delivery to the Corporation of an affidavit of the owner or
owners of such certificate, setting forth such allegation. The Corporation may
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his or her
legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify
it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged
loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such
new certificate.

 



 

Section 5.04. _Transfer of Stock_. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed
or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority
to transfer, the Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books. Within a reasonable time after the transfer of uncertificated
stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written
notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on
certificates pursuant to the laws of the DGCL. Subject to the provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may
prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate
relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation.
No transfer of stock shall be valid against the Corporation for any purpose
until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an
entry showing the names of the persons from and to whom it was transferred.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Record Date_. In order to determine the stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board

 



      
 

 



 

of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by
the Board of Directors, and which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor fewer
than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting (or less than twenty (20)
days if a merger or consolidation is to be acted upon at such a meeting). If
no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business
on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting,
_provided_ , however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date
for the adjourned meeting. In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty
(60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date
for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to due surrender of a
certificate for registration of transfer of any certificated shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled
to receive dividends and other distributions, to vote, to receive notice and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of the owner of the shares
represented by such certificate, and the Corporation shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or legal claim to or interest in such shares on the
part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall have notice of
such claim or interests. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for
collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed in the entry
of the transfer if, when the certificates are presented to the Corporation for
transfer or uncertificated shares are requested to be transferred, both the
transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so.

 



 

Section 5.07. _Transfer Agent and Registrar_. The Board of Directors may
appoint one (1) or more transfer agents and one (1) or more registrars, and
may require all certificates representing shares to bear the signature of any
such transfer agents or registrars.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

Section 6.01. _Mandatory Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
Corporation shall indemnify and provide advancement to any Indemnitee to the
fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time. The
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred in this Section shall be
contract rights. In

 



      
 

 



 

furtherance of the foregoing indemnification and advancement obligations, and
without limiting the generality thereof:

 



 

(a) _Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the
Corporation_. Any Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of
indemnification and advancement provided in this Section 6.01(a) if, by reason
of his or her Corporate Status (as defined below), Indemnitee is, or is
threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding other than
a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation. Pursuant to this Section
6.01(a), any Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her, or on his or her behalf, in connection with such
Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good
faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal
Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitees conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not,
of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and
in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitees
conduct was unlawful.

 



 

(b) _Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Any Indemnitee shall
be entitled to the rights of indemnification and advancement provided in this
Section 6.01(b) if, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, Indemnitee is,
or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding
brought by or in the right of the Corporation. Pursuant to this Section
6.01(b), any Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by Indemnitee, or on Indemnitees behalf, in connection
with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , if applicable law so provides, no
indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim,
issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been
finally adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such
Proceeding was brought shall determine that such indemnification may be made.

 



 

(c) The Corporation hereby acknowledges that Indemnitees may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by sources other than the Corporation (" _Third Party Indemnitors_ "). The
Corporation hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e.,
its obligations to the Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the Third
Party Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the
same expenses or liabilities incurred by the Indemnitees are secondary), (ii)
that it shall be required to advance the full amount of Expenses incurred by
the Indemnitees and shall be liable for the full amount of all Expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted and as required by the terms of this paragraph and the
Bylaws of the Corporation from

 



      
 

 



 

time to time (or any other agreement between the Corporation and the
Indemnitees), without regard to any rights the Indemnitees may have against
the Third Party Indemnitors, and (iii) that it irrevocably waives,
relinquishes and releases the Third Party Indemnitors from any and all claims
against the Third Party Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that
no advancement or payment by the Third Party Indemnitors on behalf of the
Indemnitees with respect to any claim for which the Indemnitees have sought
indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the Third
Party Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or to be subrogated
to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the Indemnitees against the Corporation. The Corporation and the
Indemnitees agree that the Third Party Indemnitors are express third party
beneficiaries of the terms of this paragraph.

 



 

Section 6.02. _Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly
Successful_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, to the
extent that any Indemnitee is, by reason of his or her Corporate Status, a
party to and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding, he
or she shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such
may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith. If
such Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful,
on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues
or matters in such Proceeding, the Corporation shall indemnify Indemnitee
against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his
or her behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or
matter. For purposes of this Section 6.02 and without limitation, the
termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal,
with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to
such claim, issue or matter.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Employees and Agents_. This Section VI shall not limit the
right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to
indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees when and
as authorized by appropriate corporate action. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Advancement of Expenses_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Article VI, the Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred by or
on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of
Indemnitees Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the
Corporation of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such
advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final
disposition of such Proceeding, and regardless of such Indemnitees ability to
repay any such amounts in the event of an ultimate determination that
Indemnitee is not entitled thereto. Such statement or statements shall
reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or
be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of
Indemnitee to repay any

 



      
 

 



 

Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Any advances and
undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be unsecured and
interest free.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Non-Exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and to the
payment of Expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of the final
disposition of such Proceeding conferred in this Article VI shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any
agreement, vote of stockholders, resolution of directors or otherwise. The
assertion or employment of any right or remedy in this Article VI, or
otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any
other right or remedy.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have the power to purchase
and maintain insurance, at its expense, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, as such may be amended from time to time. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Corporation shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to
become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or who is
serving, was serving, or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise, against any liability asserted
against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability.

 



 

Section 6.07. _Exception to Rights of Indemnification and Advancement_.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Article VI, the Corporation shall not be
obligated by this Article VI to make any indemnity or advancement in
connection with any claim made against an Indemnitee:

 



 

(a) subject to Section 6.01(c), for which payment has actually been made to or
on behalf of such Indemnitee under any insurance policy or other indemnity
provision, except with respect to any excess beyond the amount paid under any
insurance policy or other indemnity provision;

 



 

(b) for an accounting of profits made from the purchase and sale (or sale and
purchase) by such Indemnitee of securities of the Corporation within the
meaning of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or similar provisions of state
statutory law or common law;

 



 

(c) for reimbursement to the Corporation of any bonus or other incentive-based
or equity based compensation or of any profits realized by Indemnitee from the
sale of securities of the Corporation in each case as required under the
Exchange Act; or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) in connection with any Proceeding (or any part of any Proceeding)
initiated by such Indemnitee, including any Proceeding (or any part of any
Proceeding) initiated by such Indemnitee against the Corporation or its
directors, officers, employees or other Indemnitees, unless (i) the
Corporation has joined in or, prior to such Proceedings initiation, the Board
of Directors authorized such Proceeding (or any part of such Proceeding), (ii)
the Corporation provides the indemnification or advancement, in its sole
discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under applicable
law, or (iii) the Proceeding is one to enforce such Indemnitees rights under
this Article VI, Article VII of the Certificate of Incorporation or any other
indemnification, advancement or exculpation rights to which Indemnitee may at
any time be entitled under applicable law or any agreement.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Definitions_. For purposes of this Article VI:

 



 

(a) " _Corporate Status_ " describes the status of an individual who is or was
or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation or who is
serving, was serving, or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation
as a director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise.

 



 

(b) " _Enterprise_ " shall mean the Corporation and any other corporation,
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger to which the Corporation (or any of their wholly
owned subsidiaries) is a party, limited liability company, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, of which Indemnitee
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary, employee or agent.

 



 

(c) " _Expenses_ " shall include all direct and indirect costs, fees and
expenses of any type or nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, all
attorneys fees and costs, retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of
experts, witness fees, travel expenses, fees of private investigators and
professional advisors, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs,
telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, fax transmission charges,
secretarial services, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes imposed on
Indemnitee as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any payments under
this Article VI, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, and all other
disbursements, obligations or expenses in connection with prosecuting,
defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating, being or preparing
to be a witness in, settlement or appeal of, or otherwise participating in, a
Proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable compensation for time
spent by the Indemnitee for which he or she is not otherwise compensated by
the Corporation or any third party. Expenses also shall include Expenses
incurred in connection with any appeal resulting from any Proceeding,
including without limitation the principal, premium, security for, and other
costs relating to any cost bond, supersedeas bond, or other appeal bond or its
equivalent.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) " _Indemnitee_ " means any current or former director or officer of the
Corporation; and

 



 

(e) " _Proceeding_ " shall include any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit, arbitration, mediation, alternate dispute resolution mechanism,
investigation, inquiry, administrative hearing or any other actual, threatened
or completed proceeding, whether brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or otherwise and whether of a civil (including intentional or unintentional
tort claims), criminal, administrative or investigative (formal or informal)
nature, including appeal therefrom, in which Indemnitee was, is, will or might
be involved as a party, potential party, non-party witness or otherwise by
reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, by reason of any action (or failure to act) taken by
him or of any action (or failure to act) on his part while acting as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or by reason of the
fact that Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, trustee, general partner, managing member, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other Enterprise, in each case whether or not serving
in such capacity at the time any liability or expense is incurred for which
indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of expenses can be provided
under this Article VI. If the Indemnitee believes in good faith that a given
situation may lead to or culminate in the institution of a Proceeding, this
shall be considered a Proceeding under this Article VI.

 



 

Section 6.09. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under this
Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days
after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, Indemnitee may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction
in the State of Delaware to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. In any
such action, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee
was not entitled to the requested indemnification, advancement or payment of
Expenses. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding
in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that Indemnitee has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under these Bylaws, the
Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify
Indemnitee for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification or advancement is proper in the circumstances
because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
these Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of
conduct. If successful, in whole or in part, Indemnitee shall also be entitled
to be paid the Expenses of prosecuting such action.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.10. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this Article VI shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Change in Rights_. Neither any amendment nor repeal of this
Article VI, nor the adoption of any provision in these Bylaws inconsistent
with this Article VI, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VI
in respect of any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration,
amendment, addition to, repeal or adoption.

In accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, we hereby authorize you

available for transfer to the account or accounts that the Company and Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (" ** _Credit Suisse_** ") (with respect to the
Deferred Discount) shall direct on the Consummation Date. It is acknowledged
and agreed that while the funds are on deposit in the trust checking account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. awaiting distribution, neither the Company nor

for Registration of all or a part of their Registrable Securities, which
written demand shall describe the amount and type of securities to be included
in such Registration and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof (such

Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration and AHPAC shall effect, as soon

Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall

preceding one-hundred and fifty (150) days.

 



 

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _subsection
2.1.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration pursuant to a

the Commission and (ii) AHPAC has complied with all of its obligations under
this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , that if, after
such Registration Statement has been declared effective, an offering of
Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is
subsequently interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission, federal or state court or any other

 



      
 

 



 

governmental agency the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise
terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue
with such Registration and accordingly notify AHPAC in writing, but in no
event later than five (5) days, of such election; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that AHPAC shall not be obligated or required to file another Registration
Statement until the Registration Statement that has been previously filed with
respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration becomes effective
or is subsequently terminated.

 



 

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection 2.1.5_
and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
so advise AHPAC as part of their Demand Registration that the offering of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering (including a Block Trade), then the right of
such Demanding Holder or Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable
Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders
participation in such Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided
herein. All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities
through an Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.1.3_ shall enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s)
selected for such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders initiating the Demand Registration.

Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand Registration, in
good faith, advises AHPAC, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders
(if any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities

taken together with all other shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity
securities that AHPAC desires to sell and the shares of Class A Common Stock,
if any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate
written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any other
stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of equity securities that can be sold in such Underwritten Offering
without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the
" ** _Maximum Number of Securities_** "), then AHPAC shall include in such
Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable Securities of
the PIPE Holders and the Lender Holders that are Demanding Holders or
Requesting Holders (in each case pro rata based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that such Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if
any) has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities that such Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten Offering (such
proportion is referred to herein as " ** _Pro Rata_** ")) that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (i), the Registrable Securities of the Existing Holders and the other

withdraw from a Registration pursuant to such Demand Registration pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification
to AHPAC and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of their intention to
withdraw from such Registration prior to (x) in the case of a Demand
Registration not involving any Underwritten Offering, the effectiveness of the
applicable Registration Statement or (y) in the case of any Demand
Registration involving an Underwritten Offering, prior to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon withdrawal by a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating a Demand

in this Agreement, AHPAC shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.5_.

 



 

2.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or

or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities
solely to AHPACs existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is

AHPAC included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended

Registration not involving an Underwritten Offering, prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Piggyback Registration or (y) in the case of any Piggyback
Registration involving an Underwritten Offering, prior to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering. AHPAC (whether on its own good faith determination or
as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate
written contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed
with the Commission in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, AHPAC shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

 



 

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof shall not be counted
as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under _subsection
2.1.1_ hereof.

 



 

2.3 _Registrations on Form S-3_. The Holders of Registrable Securities may at
any time, and from time to time, request in writing that AHPAC, pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or all of their
Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration
statement that may be available at such time (" ** _Form S-3_**"). Within
five (5) days of AHPACs receipt of a written request from a Holder or Holders
of Registrable Securities for a Registration

 



      
 

 



 

on Form S-3, AHPAC shall promptly give written notice of the proposed
Registration on Form S-3 to all other Holders of Registrable Securities, and
each Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or
a portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in such Registration on Form
S-3 shall so notify AHPAC, in writing, within ten (10) days after the receipt
by the Holder of the notice from AHPAC. As soon as practicable thereafter, but
not more than twelve (12) days after AHPACs initial receipt of such written
request for a Registration on Form S-3, AHPAC shall register all or such
portion of such Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such
written request, together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities
of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the
written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that AHPAC shall not be obligated to effect any such Registration pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ hereof if (i) a Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or
(ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the Holders of any
other equity securities of AHPAC entitled to inclusion in such Registration,
propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such other equity securities
(if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than $5,000,000. The
Holders agree that in any Underwritten Offering under such Form S-3 in which
the number of Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to sell
exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then the Registrable Securities of
such Holders to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be determined
in accordance with _Section 2.1.4_.

 



 

2.4 _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to AHPACs good faith estimate of the date
of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120) days after
the effective date of, an AHPAC initiated Registration and provided that AHPAC
has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand
Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ and it continues to actively
employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause the applicable
Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders have requested an
Underwritten Offering and AHPAC and the Holders are unable to obtain the
commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good
faith judgment of the Board such Registration would be seriously detrimental
to AHPAC and the Board concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the
filing of such Registration Statement at such time, then in each case AHPAC
shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the
Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be
seriously detrimental to AHPAC for such Registration Statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement. In such event, AHPAC shall have the right to defer
such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that AHPAC shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than
once in any 12-month period; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in such
event, the Demanding Holders will be entitled to withdraw their request for a
Demand Registration and, if such request is withdrawn, such Demand
Registration will not count as a Demand Registration, and AHPAC will pay all
registration expenses in connection with such withdrawn Registration.

 



 

2.5 _Underwritten Shelf Offerings and Block Trades_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Article II, but subject to Sections 2.4 and 3.4, a Holder
has a right to elect to sell its Registrable Securities in an underwritten
shelf offering or a Block Trade (a "Shelf Underwriting") at a time when, and
pursuant to, a Form S-3 covering the applicable Registrable Securities is
effective or AHPAC is eligible to file a Form S-3 with immediate
effectiveness. Notwithstanding any other time periods in this Article II, a
demanding Holder shall provide written notice (a "Shelf Underwriting Request")
of its election to sell such Holders Registrable Securities to AHPAC
specifying (i) the proposed date of the commencement of the Shelf
Underwriting, which date shall be at least ten (10) business days after the
date of such Shelf Underwriting Notice, and (ii) the number of such Holders
Registrable Securities to be included in such Shelf Underwriting. AHPAC shall
give written notice (a "Shelf Underwriting Notice") to the other Holders as
promptly as practicable, but no later than two (2) business days after receipt
of the Shelf Underwriting Request. The Company shall include in such Shelf
Underwriting (i) the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included
in such Shelf Underwriting by the demanding Holder and (ii) the number of
shares of Registrable Securities of any other Holders who shall have made a
written request to AHPAC within five (5) business days of receipt of the Shelf
Underwriting Notice to include their Registrable Securities in such Shelf
Underwriting (which request shall have specified the maximum number of
Registrable Securities intended to be sold by such requesting Holder in such
Shelf Underwriting); provided, however, that the Holders agree that in any
Shelf Underwriting in which the number of Registrable Securities that the
Holders have requested to sell exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then
the Registrable Securities of such Holders to be included in such Shelf
Underwriting shall be determined in accordance with the cut back provisions
set forth in _Section 2.1.4_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Article II, but subject to Sections 2.4 and 3.4, as expeditiously as possible,
AHPAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate such Shelf
Underwriting on the requested date. The Holders shall use reasonable best
efforts to work with AHPAC and the Underwriters in order to facilitate
preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus

 



      
 

 



 

and other offering documentation related to the Shelf Underwriting and any
related due diligence and comfort procedures.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** ** 
AHPAC PROCEDURES**

 



 

3.1 _General Procedures_. If AHPAC is required to effect the Registration of
Registrable Securities, AHPAC shall use its best efforts to effect such
Registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto AHPAC
shall, as expeditiously as possible:

 



 

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold;

 



 

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the
Prospectus, as may be requested by the Holders or any Underwriter of
Registrable Securities or as may be required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by AHPAC or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the Registration
Statement effective until all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the
Prospectus;

 



 

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any, and
the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration, and to
such Holders legal counsel, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed
to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in
each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement
(including each preliminary Prospectus), and such other documents as the
Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration or the one legal counsel for such Holders may request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holders
(and in each case shall consider in good-faith any comments provided by such
persons);

 



 

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or " ** _blue sky_** " laws of
such jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended
plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause
such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of AHPAC and do any and all
other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that AHPAC shall not be required to
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify or take any action to which it would be
subject to general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction
where it is not then otherwise so subject;

 



 

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by

for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective date of such
Registration Statement;

 



 

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it

by the Commission, any stop order by the Commission suspending the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening
of any proceeding for such

 



       
 

 



 

purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance
of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be
issued;

 



 

3.1.8 at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus;

 



 

3.1.9 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

 



 

3.1.10 permit a representative of the Holders, the Underwriters, if any, and
any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriter to
participate, at each such persons own expense, in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and each such Prospectus included therein or filed with
the Commission, Commission, and each amendment or supplement thereto, and will
give each of them such access to its books and records and such opportunities
to discuss the business, finances and accounts of AHPAC and its subsidiaries
with its officers, directors and the independent public accountants who have
certified its financial statements as shall be necessary, in the opinion of
such Holders and such underwriters respective counsel, to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act, and will
and cause AHPACs officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such representative, Underwriter, attorney or
accountant in connection with the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such representatives or Underwriters if requested by AHPAC enter into a
confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
AHPAC, prior to the release or disclosure of any such information;

 



 

3.1.11 obtain a "cold comfort" letter from AHPACs independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Offering, in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold comfort"
letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and reasonably
satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating Holders;

 



 

3.1.12 if such offering is an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities,
use its reasonable best efforts to provide to the Underwriters legal opinions
and negative assurance letters of AHPACs outside counsel, addressed to the
underwriters in form, substance and scope reasonably satisfactory to such
Underwriters covering such matters of the type customarily covered by legal
opinions and negative assurance letters of such nature and other matters as
may be reasonably requested by such Underwriters;

 



 

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with
the managing Underwriter of such offering;

 



 

3.1.14 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12)
months beginning with the first day of AHPACs first full calendar quarter
after the effective date of the Registration Statement which satisfies the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, including Rule 158 thereunder (or any successor rule
promulgated by the Commission);

 



 

3.1.15 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable Securities
involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, use its reasonable efforts
to make available senior executives of AHPAC to participate in customary "road
show" presentations that may be reasonably requested by the Underwriter in any
Underwritten Offering; and

 



 

3.1.16 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection
with such Registration.

 



 

3.2 _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all Registrations
shall be borne by AHPAC. It is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders
shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of
Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters commissions and discounts and
brokerage fees, and, other than as set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in the definition of " ** _Registration Expenses,_** " all reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

 



 

3.3 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.

 



 

3.3.1 No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity
securities of AHPAC pursuant to a Registration initiated by AHPAC hereunder
unless such person (i) agrees to sell such persons securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by AHPAC and (ii) completes
and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities,
lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as
may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 



 

3.3.2 Holders participating in an Underwritten Offering may, at their option,
require that any or all of the representations and warranties by AHPAC to and
for the benefit of the Underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit
of such Holders and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such Underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of
such Holders; provided, however, that AHPAC shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties with respect to written information specifically
provided by a Holder in writing for inclusion in the Registration Statement.

 



 

3.4 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written notice
from AHPAC that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a
Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that AHPAC
hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as soon as
practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in writing
by AHPAC that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed (any such period, a "
** _Suspension Period_** "). If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued
use of a (including in connection with any Underwritten Offering) Registration
Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would require AHPAC to
make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to AHPAC for reasons
beyond AHPACs control, AHPAC may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of (including in connection with any Underwritten Offering), such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by AHPAC to be necessary for
such purpose (any such period, a " ** _Blackout Period_** ") and in no event
shall (i) AHPAC deliver notice of a Blackout Period to the Holders more than
two times in any calendar year (or more than once in a six month period) or
(ii) Blackout Periods be in effect for an aggregate of forty-five (45) days or
more in any calendar year. In the event AHPAC exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. AHPAC shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of
any period during which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.

 



 

3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, AHPAC, at all times while it shall be a reporting company under
the Exchange Act, covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to file
timely (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable
grace period) all reports required to be filed by AHPAC after the date hereof
pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings (the
delivery of which will be satisfied by AHPACs filing of such reports on the
Commissions EDGAR system). AHPAC further covenants that it shall take such
further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of Class A
Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under
the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated by the Commission),
including providing customary legal opinions to AHPACs transfer agent with
respect thereto. Upon the request of any Holder, AHPAC shall deliver to such
Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

 



 

3.6 _Transfer Restrictions_.

 



 

3.6.1 During the New Holder Lock-Up Period, no New Holder shall offer, sell,
contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or
otherwise dispose of or distribute (" ** _Transfer_** ") any shares of Class A
Common Stock or any other options or warrants to purchase any shares of Class
A Common Stock or any

 



      
 

 



 

securities convertible into, exercisable for, exchangeable for or that
represent the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock, whether now
owned or hereinafter acquired, that is owned directly by such New Holder
(including securities held as a custodian) or with respect to which such New
Holder has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the
Commission other than Registrable Securities issued to the Lender Holders
pursuant to that certain Exchange Agreement, dated on or about the date
hereof, by and among AHPAC and the Lender Holders (collectively, the " **
_Restricted Shares_** "). The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to
preclude each New Holder from engaging in any hedging or other transaction
which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or
result in a sale or disposition of the Restricted Shares even if such
Restricted Shares would be disposed of by someone other than such New Holder.
Such prohibited hedging or other transactions include any short sale or any
purchase, sale or grant of any right (including any put or call option) with
respect to any of the Restricted Shares of the applicable New Holder or with
respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant
part of its value from such Restricted Shares.

 



 

3.6.2 Each New Holder hereby represents and warrants that it now has, and,
except as contemplated by this _subsection 3.6.2_ , for the duration of the
New Holder Lock-Up Period, will have, good and marketable title to its
Restricted Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims that
could impact the ability of such New Holder to comply with the foregoing
restrictions. Each New Holder agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with AHPACs transfer agent and registrar against the
transfer of any Restricted Shares during the New Holder Lock-Up Period, except
in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

 



 

3.6.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a Holder may
Transfer Restricted Shares or Founder Stock prior to the expiration of the
applicable lock-up period to (a) an Affiliate of such Holder or, in the case
of a Holder who is a natural person, such Holders Family Group, (b) in the
case of an entity, to its direct or indirect beneficial owners in accordance
with their pro rata ownership share in such entity, (c) any other Holder or an
Affiliate of any other Holder, or (d) such other Person upon the prior written
consent of AHPAC; _provided that_ , in each case, it shall be a condition to
any such Transfer, that the transferee execute and deliver a joinder to this
Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to AHPAC whereby such transferee
shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall thereupon be
deemed an Existing Holder or New Holder hereunder, as applicable.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** ** 
INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION**

 



 

4.1 _Indemnification_.

 



 

4.1.1 AHPAC agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Holder
of Registrable Securities, their affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and partners and each person who is a "controlling
person" such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against, and
pay and reimburse such persons for all losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses (including attorneys fees) caused by any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information
furnished in writing to AHPAC by such Holder expressly for use therein and
AHPAC will pay and reimburse any Holder and each such affiliate, director,
officer, employee, partner and controlling person for any legal or any other
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating, defending or settling any such loss, claim, liability, action
or proceeding. AHPAC shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to the indemnification of the Holder or as is reasonable and customary
in an underwritten offering.

 



 

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to AHPAC in
writing such information and affidavits as AHPAC reasonably requests for use
in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the
extent permitted by law, shall indemnify AHPAC, its directors and officers and
agents and each person who controls AHPAC (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) resulting from any
untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission of

 



      
 

 



 

a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders of
Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to indemnification of AHPAC.

 



 

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall
not impair any persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such
failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless
in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such
claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement unless (i) such settlement is to be settled in all respects by the
payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant
to the terms of such settlement) (ii) such settlement includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation and (iii) such settlement does not include an admission of fault by
such indemnified party.

 



 

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. AHPAC and each
Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also agrees to
make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for
contribution to such party in the event AHPACs or such Holders
indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

 



 

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying partys and
indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ , _4.1.2_ and
_4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The
parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by pro rata allocation or
by any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

5.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

5.2.1 This Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of AHPAC hereunder
may not be assigned or delegated by AHPAC in whole or in part.

 



 

5.2.2 Prior to the expiration of the Founder Lock-up Period or the New Holder
Lock-Up Period, as the case may be, no Holder may assign or delegate such
Holders rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in
part, in violation of the applicable lock-up period, except in connection with
a transfer of Registrable Securities by such Holder to another Holder or a
Permitted Transferee but only if such Permitted Transferee agrees to become
bound by the transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

5.2.3 This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of each of the parties and its successors and the
permitted assigns of the Holders, which shall include Permitted Transferees.

 



 

5.2.4 This Agreement shall not confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not parties hereto, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and _Section 5.2_ hereof.

 



 

5.2.5 No assignment by any party hereto of such partys rights, duties and
obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate AHPAC unless and until
AHPAC shall have received (i) written notice of such assignment as provided in
_Section 5.1_ hereof and (ii) the written agreement of the assignee, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to AHPAC, to be bound by the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (which may be accomplished by an addendum or certificate of
joinder to this Agreement). Any transfer or assignment made other than as
provided in this _Section 5.2_ shall be null and void.

 



 

5.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including facsimile or PDF counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an
original, and all of which together shall constitute the same instrument, but
only one of which need be produced.

 



 

5.4 _Governing Law; Venue_. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLACE WHERE THIS AGREEMENT MAY
BE EXECUTED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK AS APPLIED TO AGREEMENTS AMONG NEW YORK RESIDENTS ENTERED INTO AND
TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF
LAW PROVISIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION. ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF

 



      
 

 



 

NEW YORK IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND EACH PARTY
IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 



 

5.5 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of (i) AHPAC and
(ii) Holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities
held by the Holders at the time in question, compliance with any of the
provisions, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be
waived, or any of such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or
modified; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any
amendment hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects either the Existing
Holders as a group or the New Holders as group, respectively, in a manner that
is materially adversely different from Existing Holders or New Holders, as
applicable shall require the consent of at least a majority-in-interest of the
Registrable Securities held by such Existing Holders, or a majority-in-
interest of the Registerable Securities held by such New Holders, as
applicable, at the time in question so affected, _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that
adversely affects one Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of the shares
of capital stock of AHPAC, in a manner that is materially different from the
other Holders (in such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder so
affected. No course of dealing between any Holder or AHPAC and any other party
hereto or any failure or delay on the part of a Holder or AHPAC in exercising
any rights or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any
rights or remedies of any Holder or AHPAC. No single or partial exercise of
any rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a
waiver or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Board may grant, in its sole discretion, one or more waivers to
any Holder from the restrictions on transfer during the Founder Lock-up Period
or New Holder Lock-up Period, as applicable, in order to assist AHPAC in
meeting NASDAQ listing requirements.

 



 

5.6 _Other Registration Rights_. AHPAC represents and warrants that no person,
other than a Holder of Registrable Securities, has any right to require AHPAC
to register any securities of AHPAC for sale or to include such securities of
AHPAC in any Registration filed by AHPAC for the sale of securities for its
own account or for the account of any other person (collectively, " **
_Registration Rights_** "). Further, AHPAC represents and warrants that this
Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with
similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict between any such
agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail. AHPAC agrees that it will not enter into, any agreement with respect
to its securities that includes Registration Rights that are more favorable
than the rights granted under this Agreement or that violates or is otherwise
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities
under this Agreement without the written consent of a majority-in-interest of
the Registrable Securities held by the Holders at the time in question. For
the term of this Agreement, AHPAC shall not grant to any Person the right to
require AHPAC to register any equity securities of AHPAC, or any securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for such securities, without
written consent of the majority-in-interest of the Holders, unless such rights
are explicitly made subordinate to all rights granted hereunder.

 



 

5.7 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (ii) the date as of which (A) all
of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a Registration
Statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred to in
Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) or (B) the
Holders of all Registrable Securities are permitted to sell the Registrable
Securities under Rule 144 (or any similar provision) under the Securities Act
without limitation on the amount of securities sold or the manner of sale. The
provisions of _Section 3.5_ and _Article IV_ shall survive any termination.
