Price on September 30, 2007 would have been $166,805,471, as set forth on
the  Baseline Balance Sheet.

 

 

3.2 _Payment  of Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to
Company the  Purchase Price. Each balance sheet prepared pursuant to any
provision of Article  3 shall conform to the format set forth in _Schedule
3.1_ , in which balance  sheet items are classified as Assets, Assumed
Liabilities, Retained Assets  or  Retained Liabilities, as the case may be.

 

 

3.3 _Purchase  Price Adjustment_.

 

 

(a) As  promptly as practicable, but no later than four (4) Business Days
prior to  Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser the Record Date
Balance Sheet  together with the Company's calculation of the Closing Date
Purchase Price  Adjustment.

 

 

(b) As  promptly as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days after the
Closing  Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Stockholder a  balance sheet (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and a
certificate based  on such Closing Date Balance Sheet setting forth
Purchaser's calculation of the  changes in the net value of the Assets and
Liabilities for the balance sheet  categories specified in Schedule 3.1 (but
not for any other balance sheet  categories) between the Baseline Balance
Sheet Date and the Closing Date (the  " _Final_ _Purchase Price Adjustment_
").

 

 

(c) If  Stockholder disagrees with Purchaser's calculation of the Final
Purchase Price  Adjustment delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ ,
Stockholder may, within  15 days after delivery of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet, deliver a notice  to  Purchaser stating that Stockholder disagrees
with such calculation and  specifying in reasonable detail  those items or
amounts as to which Stockholder disagrees and the basis  therefor.
Stockholder shall be deemed to have agreed with all other  items and amounts
contained in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the  calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment delivered pursuant to  _Section 3.3(b)_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) If  a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
_Section  3.3(c)_ , Stockholder and Purchaser shall, during the 15 days
following such  delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the  disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be
required, the amount  of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment. If during such
period,  Stockholder and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they
shall  promptly thereafter cause an independent accounting firm meeting the
Independent  Accounting Firm Guidelines (the " _Independent Accountant_ ")
(or if  Stockholder and Purchaser are unable to agree upon such a firm within
ten (10)  Business Days after the notice of disagreement is received, then
within an  additional ten (10) Business Days, Stockholder and Purchaser shall
each select  one such firm and those two firms shall select a third such
firm, in which  event "Independent Accountant" shall mean such third firm),
to review this Agreement  and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose
of calculating the Final  Purchase Price Adjustment (it being understood that
in making such calculation,  the Independent Accountant shall be functioning
as an expert and not as an  arbitrator). Each of Purchaser and Stockholder
agree that it shall  not engage, or agree to engage the Independent
Accountant to perform any  services other than as the Independent Accountant
pursuant hereto until the  Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment have been finally  determined pursuant to this _Section 3.3_. Each
party  agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Accountant, a
reasonable  engagement letter. Purchaser and Stockholder shall cooperate with
the  Independent Accountant and promptly provide all documents and
information  requested by the Independent Accountant. In making such
calculation,  the Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or
amounts in the  Closing Balance Sheet and Purchaser's calculation of the
Final Purchase Price  Adjustment as to which Stockholder has disagreed in its
notice of disagreement  duly delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. The
Independent  Accountant shall deliver to Stockholder and Purchaser, as
promptly as  practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date
of engagement  of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth such 
calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Stockholder  and
Purchaser, shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on 
Purchaser and Stockholder, and neither Purchaser nor Stockholder shall seek 
further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than to enforce such 
report. Judgment may be entered to enforce such report in any court  of
competent jurisdiction. The Independent Accountant will determine  the
allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the inverse of 
the  percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount  of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the
Independent  Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in
amount  to $1,000 and the Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of
Stockholder's  position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by
Purchaser and 40%  of  the costs would be borne by Stockholder.

 

 

(e) Stockholder,  Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective  representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of
the Closing  Balance  Sheet and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment and in the  conduct of the review referred to in this _Section
3.3_ , including the  making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and  personnel.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) If  the amount to be paid to Stockholder as a result of the Final
Purchase Price  Adjustment exceeds the amount to be paid to Stockholder as a
result of the  Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustment, Purchaser shall pay to
Stockholder,  in  the manner and with interest as provided in _Section
3.3(g)_ , the amount of  such excess and, if the amount to be paid to
Stockholder as a result of Final  Purchase Price Adjustment is less than the
amount to be paid to Stockholder  as a  result of the Closing Date Purchase
Price Adjustment, Stockholder shall pay  to  Purchaser, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, in the manner and with  interest as provided in _Section
3.3(g)_, the amount of such  shortfall. The Final Purchase Price Adjustment
shall be computed (i) as shown  in  Purchaser's calculation delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ if no notice  of disagreement with respect
thereto is duly delivered pursuant to _Section  3.3(c)_ ; or (ii) if such a
notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed  by Stockholder and
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ or (B) in the  absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Independent Accountant's calculation  delivered
pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that in no event
shall Final Purchase Price Adjustment be more than Purchaser's  calculation
of Final Purchase Price Adjustment delivered pursuant to _Section  3.3(b)_ or
less than Stockholder's calculation of Closing Date Purchase Price 
Adjustment delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_.

 

 

(g) Any  payment pursuant to _Section 3.3(e)_ shall be made at a mutually
convenient  time and place within five (5) Business Days after Final Purchase
Price  Adjustment has been determined by wire transfer by Purchaser or
Stockholder,  as  the case may be, of immediately available funds to the
account of such other  party as may be designated in writing by such other
party. The amount  of any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.3_
shall bear  interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of  payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest published
from time  to  time by _The Wall Street Journal,_ Eastern Edition, as the
"prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks during the period from the
Closing  Date to the  date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the
same time as  the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily
on the basis  of a  year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

 

 

(h) The  Company and Purchaser shall allocate the Purchase Price and any
Assumed  Liabilities required to be taken into account for income tax
purposes among  the  Assets and the covenants in _Section 8.6_ as reflected
on _Schedule  3.3(h)_ as such Schedule will be updated as of Closing and, in
accordance  with such allocation, the Company shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser copies  of Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the "
_Asset Acquisition  Statement_ "). The Asset Acquisition Statement shall be
prepared in  accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the treasury
regulations  promulgated thereunder. The Company shall prepare and deliver
to  Purchaser from time to time revised copies of the Asset Acquisition
Statement  (the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as to report any matters on the
Asset  Acquisition Statement that need updating (including purchase price
adjustments,  if any) consistent with the agreed upon  allocation. Purchase
Price (plus the Assumed Liabilities, as  applicable) shall be allocated in
accordance with the Asset Acquisition  Statement or, if

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

applicable,  the last Revised Statements, provided by the Company to
Purchaser, and all  income Tax Returns and reports filed by Purchaser and the
Company shall be  prepared consistently with such allocation. Neither
Purchaser nor the  Company shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Affiliates to, take  any  position inconsistent with the Asset Acquisition
Statement or the  then-applicable Revised Statements.

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) by  Purchaser if there has been an event, change, occurrence or

and shall deliver such proof of  payment to Purchaser on or before the

in the Ordinary  Course of Business.

 

 

(b) Except  (I) as set forth on _Schedule 8.2_, (II) as required by

(ii) permit  the Company to enter into or agree to enter into any merger,
consolidation  or  sale of any of the Assets to any other Person; or

Purchaser, and the Company  and the Stockholder shall cooperate with
Purchaser and use their commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain at the
earliest practicable date all consents  and  approvals required to

without limitation, the consents and approvals referred  to  in _Sections

8.4 _Regulatory  Approvals_.

 

 

(a) Each  of Purchaser, the Company and the Stockholder (if necessary) shall
(i) make  or  cause to be made all filings required of each of them or any
of their respective  Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable  and,  in any event, within 20 Business Days after
the date of this Agreement in the  case of all filings required under the HSR
Act and within four weeks in the  case  of all other filings required by
other Antitrust Laws, (ii) comply at the  earliest practicable date with any
request under the HSR Act or other Antitrust  Laws for additional
information, documents, or other materials received by  each  of them or any
of their respective subsidiaries or Affiliates from the FTC,  the  Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Body in respect of such filings  or  such
transactions, and (iii) cooperate with each other in connection with any 
such filing (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, providing 
copies of all such documents to the non-filing parties prior to filing and 
considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in 
connection therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or 
other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or other
Governmental  Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing
or any such  transaction. Each such party shall use its best

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

efforts  to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or  other  filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall  promptly inform the other parties hereto of any oral
communication with,  and  provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Body regarding  any such filings or any such transaction. No
party hereto shall  independently participate in any formal meeting with any
Governmental Body  in  respect of any such filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving  the  other parties hereto prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted  by  such Governmental Body, the
opportunity to attend and/or  participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto will  consult and cooperate with one another in connection
with any analyses,  appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals  made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
relating to proceedings  under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Any party
may, as it deems  advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive  material provided to the other parties under this
_Section 8.4_ as "outside  counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein  shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will  not  be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors  of the  recipient, unless express written permission
is obtained in advance from  the  source of the materials.

 

 

 

(b) Each  of Purchaser and the Company shall use its best efforts to resolve
such  objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect  to  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act, the Sherman  Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission  Act,  as amended, and any other United States federal or
state or foreign statutes,  rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or  other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having  the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively,  the " _Antitrust Laws_
"). In connection therewith, if any Legal  Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any  transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as in violation of any Antitrust  Law,  each of Purchaser and
the Company shall cooperate and use its best efforts  to  contest and resist
any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,  reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order whether 
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, 
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and 
judicial appeal, unless by mutual agreement, Purchaser and the Company
decide  that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of 
Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take 
such  action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods
under  the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions
as  promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. In connection
with  and without limiting the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company
agree  to  use its best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary
to avoid  or  eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws
that may be  asserted by any Federal, state and local and non-United States
antitrust or  competition authority, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

expeditiously  as possible, including effecting or committing to effect, by
consent decree,  hold separate orders, trust or otherwise  the sale or
disposition of such of its assets or businesses as are required  to  be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution  of,
any  decree, Order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
other  order  in any suit or preceding, that would otherwise have the effect
of preventing  or  materially delaying the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement.

 

 

 

8.5 _Further  Assurances_. Subject to, and not in limitation of, _Section 
8.4_ , each of Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable  efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause
the fulfillment  at  the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions
to their respective  obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement.

 

 

8.6 _Non-Competition;  Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality, Etc_.

 

 

(a) For  a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, neither
the Company  nor the Stockholder shall directly or indirectly, own, manage,
engage in,  operate, control, work for, consult with, render services for, do
business  with,  maintain any interest in (proprietary, financial or
otherwise) or participate  in  the ownership, management, operation or
control of, any business, whether in  corporate, proprietorship or
partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the  micro-ticket equipment lease
financing business or that otherwise competes  with  the Business (a "
_Restricted Business_ "); _provided_ , however, that  the restrictions
contained in this _Section 8.6(a)_ shall not restrict the  acquisition by the
Stockholder, directly or indirectly, of (i) less than 5%  of  the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a 
Restricted Business, (ii) any company of which a Restricted Business is not 
the  principal operation or purpose; or (iii) any distressed assets acquired
in  a  secondary market, and _provided_ , further, that the restrictions
contained  in this _Section 8.6(a)_ shall not restrict the Stockholder from
directly  or indirectly (x) engaging in any Restricted Business in which it
was engaged  as  of the Closing Date, or (y) disposing of, servicing or
dealing in any way with  the Retained Assets.

 

 

(b) Purchaser  acknowledges that the information provided to it in connection
with this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to
the terms  of  the confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and the
Company dated July  16,  2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the
terms of which are  incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and
only upon, the  Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 

 

(c) Neither  the Company nor the Stockholder shall disparage the Business,
Purchaser,  Purchaser's business or any of Purchaser's shareholders,
directors, officers,  employees or agents. Purchaser will not disparage
Stockholder,  Stockholder's business or any of Stockholder's shareholders,
directors,  officers, employees or agents.

 

 

(d) If  a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines  that any term or provision contained in _Section 8.6_ is invalid
or  unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal will
have  the  power to reduce  the scope, duration or geographic area of the
term or provision, to delete  specific words or phrases or to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

delete  any invalid or unenforceable term or provision. This Section 8.6
will  be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within
which  the  judgment may be appealed. This _Section 8.6_ is reasonable and 
necessary to protect and preserve parties legitimate business interests and 
to  prevent any unfair advantage. The parties hereto acknowledge and  agree
that any remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 
8.6_ would be inadequate, and hereby consent to the granting by any court 
of  an injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of
actual  monetary loss being proved, in order that the breach or threatened
breach  of  such provisions may be effectively restrained.

 

 

 

8.7 _Preservation  of Records_. The Stockholder and Purchaser agree that each
of them  shall preserve and keep the records held by them or their Affiliates
relating  to  the respective businesses of the Company for a period of seven
years from the  Closing Date and shall make such books, records and personnel
available to  the  other as may be reasonably required by such party (i) in
connection with the  preparation of financial statements, regulatory filings
or Tax returns of the  Company and the Stockholder or their Affiliates in
respect of periods ending  on  or prior to Closing, (ii) in connection with
any insurance claims by, Legal  Proceedings or tax audits against or
governmental investigations of the  Stockholder or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates, (iii) in order to  enable the Stockholder or Purchaser to comply
with their respective obligations  under this Agreement and each other
agreement, document or instrument  contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iv)
for the purposes of administering the  Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the
Retained Assets and/or the Retained  Liabilities. In the event the
Stockholder or Purchaser wishes to  destroy such records after that time,
such party shall first give 90 days prior  written notice to the other and
such other party shall have the right at its  option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to such party within that  90  day period, to take
possession of the records within 180 days after the date  of  such notice.
The Purchaser and the Stockholder shall be entitled, at  their sole cost and
expense, to make copies of the books and records to which  they are entitled
to access pursuant to this _Section 8.7_.

 

 

8.8 _Publicity_.

 

 

(a) None  of the Stockholder, the Company or Purchaser shall issue any press
release  or  public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated  hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other party hereto,  which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed,  unless, in the sole judgment of the
Stockholder, the Company or Purchaser,  as  applicable, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the  applicable rules of any stock
exchange or interdealer automated quotation system  on which the Stockholder,
the Company, Purchaser or Affiliate of Purchaser  lists  securities,
provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the party  intending
to make such release shall use its commercially reasonable efforts 
consistent with such applicable Law to consult with the other party with
respect  to the timing and content thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  parties acknowledge that a copy of this Agreement is required to be
filed by  Purchaser under Securities Laws, and that such disclosure shall be
limited  to  the extent required by such Securities Laws.

 

 

8.9 _Use  of Name_.

 

 

(a) Purchaser  agrees that (i) it shall have no right to use or exploit the
names "Lehman  Brothers Bank", "Lehman Brothers", "Capital Crossing" or any
service marks,  trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems,
signs or insignia  related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing,
including any name  or  mark confusingly similar thereto (collectively, the
" _Subject Marks_ "), and  (ii) will not at any time hold itself out as
having any affiliation with the  Stockholder or any of its Affiliates. In
furtherance thereof, as  promptly as practicable but in no event later than
45  days ** __** following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall  remove, strike
over or otherwise obliterate all Subject Marks from all materials  including,
without limitation, any vehicles, business cards, schedules,  stationery,
packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials,  manuals, forms,
computer software and other materials.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  any other provision in this Agreement, Purchaser agrees
that for a period of  30  days following the Closing Date, Stockholder shall
have a right to continue  to  use the name "Dolphin Capital Corp." and any
service marks, trademarks, trade  names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems,
signs or insignia related thereto  in  connection with the wind down and
transition of the Retained Assets and Retained  Liabilities from the Company
to the Stockholder.

 

 

8.10 _Employment  and Employee Benefits._

 

 

(a) _Employees_.  Within 10 days following the date hereof, Purchaser shall
extend offers of  employment to at least 90% of the current employees of the
Company (the " _Continuing Employees_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser is not  obligated to extend an offer of employment to any current
employee that either  (i) the Company would have cause to terminate, or (ii)
is underperforming at  his  or her current position, and such employees
shall not be counted in making  the  calculation in the preceding sentence.
Prior to extending offers of employment  to the Continuing Employees,
Purchaser shall consult with Stockholder regarding  selection of such
Continuing Employees and criteria for such selection,  including without
limitation to ensure compliance with any applicable  Laws.

 

 

(b) _Compensation  and Benefits_.

 

 

(i) Purchaser  hereby agrees that all offers of employment to the Continuing
Employees shall  provide the Continuing Employees with initial salary and
wages no less than  a  similarly qualified employee of Purchaser as of the
date hereof.

 

 

(ii) Continuing  Employees shall have the right to participate in Purchaser's
benefits plans on a  basis no less favorable than other comparable employees
of Purchaser, including  but not limited to, health insurance, prescription 
drug  coverage, life insurance, short term disability insurance, long term
disability  insurance, paid

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

vacations,  401(k) retirement plan with company match, and any other plans or
arrangements  offered by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "). To the extent
permissible  by applicable Law, for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but
not benefit  accrual), under the Purchaser Plans, Purchaser shall credit each
Continuing  Employee with his or her years of service with the Company and
any predecessor  entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled  immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under
any similar  Company Benefit Plan. The Purchaser Plans shall not deny
Continuing Employees  coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions and
shall credit such  Continuing Employees for any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid in  the  same calendar year as the Closing (unless coverage
was denied under the  corresponding Company Benefit Plan).

 

 

8.11 _Disclosure  Schedules; Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_.
The  Company and the Stockholder may, at their option, include in the
Schedules  items  that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such  inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an  acknowledgement or representation that such
items are material, to establish  any  standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for  purposes of this Agreement.
Information disclosed in the Schedules  shall constitute a disclosure for all
purposes under this Agreement  notwithstanding any reference to a specific
section, and all such information  shall be deemed to qualify the entire
Agreement and not just such  section. From time to time prior to the Closing,
the Company shall  have the right to supplement or amend the Schedules with
respect to any matter  hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery of
the Schedules pursuant  to  this Agreement. No such supplement or amendment
shall have any effect  on the satisfaction of the condition to closing set
forth in _Section  9.1(a),_ nor shall it effect the indemnification
obligations of the  Stockholder under Article X to the extent that the
changes to the Schedules have  not already been reflected in the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to  _Section 3.3_ ).

 

 

8.12 _Notification_. The  Company or the Stockholder shall promptly notify
Purchaser of the occurrence  of  any event that is reasonably expected to
cause the satisfaction of the condition  in _Section 9.1(a)_ not to occur.

 

 

8.13 _No  Negotiation_. Until such time as this Agreement shall be 
terminated pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , except for actions taken at the 
direction of the board of directors of the Company in fulfilling its
fiduciary  duties to shareholders, or as may be required by law, the Company
shall not,  nor  shall it knowingly permit any of its representatives to,
directly or indirectly,  solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate
discussions or negotiations  with any other person, or furnish to any other
person any information  concerning, (i) any sale, transfer or other
disposition of all or a material  portion of the Assets or stock of the
Company to any person other than  Purchaser, (ii) any merger or consolidation
of the Company with or into any  person other than Purchaser, or (iii) any
issuance or sale of voting securities  of the Company to any person other
than Purchaser.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.14 _Commercially  Reasonable Efforts_. The Company and the Stockholder
shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in
_Section 9.1_ to  be satisfied. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to  cause the conditions in _Section 9.2_ to be satisfied.

 

 

8.15 _Payment  of Retained Liabilities_. If the failure to make any payments
with  respect to the Retained Liabilities will materially impair Purchaser's
use or  enjoyment of or title to the Assets or conduct of the Business,
Purchaser may,  at any time after the Closing Date, elect to pay the amounts
owed directly  (but  shall have no obligation to do so) and Stockholder
shall reimburse Purchaser  for  such amounts; _provided_ , that (i)
Purchaser has provided Stockholder with  at least thirty (30) days written
notice of its intention to pay the amounts,  and (ii) the payments are not
being disputed by the Stockholder in good  faith.

successors and permitted  assigns (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from  and against any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, demands, judgments, damages  (excluding incidental and consequential

Affiliates to take all  reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event which  would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise
thereto.

 

 

10.3 _Indemnification  by Purchaser_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to _Section 10.5_ , Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold Company,  the Stockholder and their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates,  stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and permitted  assigns  (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from and  against, and pay to the applicable Seller
Indemnified Parties the amount of,  any  and all Losses:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) based  upon or resulting from the failure of any of the representations
and warranties  made by Purchaser in this Agreement to be true and correct in
all respects  at  the date hereof; and

 

 

(ii) based  upon or resulting from the breach of any covenant on the part of
Purchaser  under  this Agreement.

 

 

(b) The  Stockholder shall take and cause its Affiliates to take all
reasonable steps  to  mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event
which would reasonably be  expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

 

 

10.4 _Indemnification  Procedures_.

 

 

(a) A  claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim  may  be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification
is  sought.

 

 

(b) In  the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted, or that any
claim  shall be asserted, by any third party in respect of which payment may
be sought  under _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ hereof (regardless of the
limitations  set forth in _Section 10.5_ ) ( an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
the  indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion
of any  Indemnification Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by
this  indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of 
the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any
Indemnification  Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying party's  obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying  party is prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
indemnifying  party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to
be represented  by  counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified  party, and to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any  Indemnification Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against by it  hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects
to defend against,  negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim which relates  to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder, it shall within 30 days  (or  sooner, if the nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires) notify the  indemnified party of its
intent to do so. If the indemnifying party  elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any  Indemnification Claim which
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder,  the indemnified party
may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal  with such
Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party shall  assume the defense of
any Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may  participate, at his or
its own expense, in the defense of such Indemnification  Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such indemnified party shall be  entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense  of the indemnifying
party if, (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to  participate or (ii)
in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified  party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the indemnified party  and  the
indemnifying

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

party  that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided_
,  _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be required to pay 
for  more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel) for
all  indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The 
parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with 
the  defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification  Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.4_ to the  contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall,  without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any  Indemnification Claim
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment  unless the claimant
and such party provide to such other party an unqualified  release from all
Liability in respect of the Indemnification  Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely  for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the  indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying  party's willingness to
accept the settlement offer and, subject to the  applicable limitations of
_Sections 10.5_ and _10.6_ , pay the amount  called for by such offer, and
the indemnified party declines to accept such  offer, the indemnified party
may continue to contest such Indemnification  Claim,  free of any
participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any  ultimate
Liability with respect to such Indemnification Claim that the  indemnifying
party has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to  the  lesser of
(A) the amount of the settlement offer that the indemnified party  declined
to accept plus the Losses of the indemnified party relating to such 
Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement 
offer  or (B) the aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to
such  Indemnification Claim.

 

 

 

(c) After  any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a Governmental  Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal  therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated,
or the indemnified  party  and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at
a mutually binding agreement  with respect to an Indemnification Claim
hereunder, the indemnified party shall  forward to the indemnifying party
notice of any sums due and owing by the  indemnifying party pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such  matter.

 

 

10.5 _Certain  Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  the provisions of this _Article X_ , neither the
Stockholder nor Purchaser  shall have any indemnification obligations for
Losses under _Sections  10.2(a)(i)_ or _(iii)_ or _Sections 10.3(a)_ unless
the aggregate  amount of all such Losses exceeds $50,000, in which event the
indemnifying  party  shall be obligated to pay the entire amount of all such
Losses; _provided_   however, that Purchaser shall not make such claims more
often than  quarterly. For clarification purposes, in the event the
aggregate  amount of all such Losses exceeds $50,000 and an initial claim is
made by a  Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10.2(a)_ ,
any  Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make subsequent claims
for  indemnification in amounts less than or greater than $50,000.

 

 

(b) In  no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by the
Stockholder  under  this _Article X_ exceed an amount equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the  Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Purchaser  shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(ii)_   unless the related breach is one which materially impairs the
value of any  Financing Contract or Financing Contracts, in which case,
Stockholder shall  have  the option to, within thirty (30) days of
notification of an indemnification  claim with respect to any Financing
Contract(s), (i) repurchase such Financing  Contract or Financing Contracts
in question from Purchaser for 101% of the  book  value of the Financing
Contract or Financing Contracts in question as of the  date of the
repurchase, or (ii) indemnify the Purchaser in accordance with  the 
provisions of _Section 10.4_. For the purposes of this _Section  10.4(c)_ , a
material impairment is one in which either damages on any  Financing Contract
exceed $500, or damages on multiple Financing Contracts  exceed $5,000.

 

 

(d) Purchaser  shall not make any claim for indemnification under this
_Article X_ in  respect of any matter that is taken into account in the
calculation of any  adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
3.3_.

 

 

10.6 _Calculation  of Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in  this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person  for  any consequential, incidental, indirect, special or
punitive damages of such  other Person, including loss of future revenue,
income or profits, diminution  of  value or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach  or  alleged breach hereof (provided that
such limitation with respect to profits  shall not limit the Stockholder's
right to recover contract damages in  connection with Purchaser's failure to
close in violation of this  Agreement).

 

 

10.7 _Tax  Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Company and Purchaser
agree  to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ as
an  adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income  tax purposes.

 

 

10.8 _Exclusive  Remedy_. From and after the Closing the sole and exclusive
remedy  for any breach or failure (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise)
to be  true  and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and
correct, of any  representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement,  shall  be indemnification in accordance with this _Article
X_. In  furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, to the
fullest extent  permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims
and causes of  action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or
unknown, foreseen  or  unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that it may have against  the  Stockholder or Purchaser, as the case may be,
arising under or based upon any  federal, state or local Law (including any
such Law relating to environmental  matters or arising under or based upon
any securities Law, common Law or  otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 10.8_   shall not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions  of  _Article III_ providing for the (i)
resolution of certain disputes relating  to the Purchase Price between the
parties and/or by an Independent Accountant  and (ii) limit  the  rights of
the parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance  or
injunctive relief).

signed by the party  against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or  waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement,  including any investigation by or on behalf of any party,

compliance with any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The  waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall  not operate or be construed as a further
or continuing waiver of such breach  or  as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part  of any party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy  hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial  exercise of such right,
