ARTICLE I. 
THE OFFER

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) (i) ** **Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Article VIII, Parent will cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser will, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of this

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to

Purchaser) to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer will be subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Unless extended in accordance with Section 1.1(a)(ii),
the Offer will expire on the twentieth (20th) Business Day (calculated as set
forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following (and including the
day of) the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "), or,
if the Offer has been extended in accordance with Section 1.1(a)(ii), at the
time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Date, or such later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in
accordance with Section 1.1(a)(ii), the " _Expiration Date_ "). Purchaser
expressly reserves the right (but will not be obligated) at any time or from
time to time in its sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify or

Parent will cause Purchaser to, accept for purchase and pay for any (subject
to the Minimum Tender Condition) and all Shares validly tendered (and not
properly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer promptly after such scheduled
Expiration Date (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). Purchaser (A) will extend the Offer for one or more
periods of time of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension if at any
scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions is not satisfied and has
not been waived; and (B) will extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
(" _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , that under no
circumstances will Purchaser be required to, nor may Purchaser without the
prior written consent of the Company, extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Purchaser
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser will file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(collectively with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_

purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ ") and will disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. The Company agrees to furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser all
information concerning the Company and required by the securities Laws to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. The Company will be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing
with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) promptly provide the Company
and its counsel with a copy of any written comments (or a description of any
oral comments) received by Parent, Purchaser or their counsel from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, (ii) consult with the Company
regarding any such comments prior to responding thereto and (iii) provide the
Company with copies of any responses to any such comments. Parent and
Purchaser agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that it has become aware that such information has become false
or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws.

Agreement is terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, Purchaser will, and Parent will cause
Purchaser to, promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination) terminate the Offer and will not acquire any Shares pursuant
thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII prior to the acquisition of Shares in the
Offer, Purchaser will promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
of such termination) return, and will cause any depositary or other agent
acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(e) The (i) Offer Price and (ii) Merger Consideration will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to (A) the payment
by Purchaser for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the Offer (with respect to the Offer Price) or (B) the
Effective Time (with respect to the Merger Consideration).

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer, any Shares subject to
notices of guaranteed delivery will be deemed not to be validly tendered into
the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to Purchaser or to an agent of Purchaser and received
by the depositary prior to the expiration of the Offer.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Company Consent; Schedule 14D-9_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable on the date the Offer Documents are filed, the
Company will file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing, subject to Section 6.3(d) and Section 6.3(e),
the Company Board Recommendation (which shall include the notice and other
information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL such that the Schedule
14D-9 will constitute a valid notice of appraisal rights under Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL) and will disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws (including by setting the Stockholder List Date (as defined
below) as the record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, provided that such record date shall not be
more than ten (10) calendar days prior to the date that the Schedule 14D-9 is
first mailed). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of
the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the holders
of Shares. Parent and Purchaser agree to furnish promptly to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Purchaser requested by the Company or
required by the securities Laws to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Except
with respect to any amendments filed in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or a Change of Board Recommendation, Parent and Purchaser will be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to its filing with the SEC. The Company agrees to (i) promptly provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel with a copy of any written comments (or a
description of any oral comments) received by the Company or its counsel from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, (ii) consult with
Parent and Purchaser regarding any such comments prior to responding thereto
and (iii) provide Parent and Purchaser with copies of any responses to any
such comments, in each case, except with respect to comments related to an
Acquisition Proposal or following a Change of Board Recommendation. Each of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it has
become aware that such information has become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities Laws; _provided_ that any such filing of the
corrected Schedule 14D-9 shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, waive, extend or restart the notice period for purposes of Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
will cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Parent and Purchaser with
mailing labels, security position listings and readily available computer
files containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares
as of the most recent practicable date (such date, the " _Stockholder List_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Date_ "), and will furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Purchaser
such information and assistance (including periodic updates of such
information) as Parent or Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
the Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause third parties to, cooperate
with Parent and Purchaser to disseminate the Offer Documents to the holders of
Shares held in or subject to the Company Equity Plans (as defined in Section
3.2(a)) and to permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares into the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
actions as are reasonably necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents, each
of Parent and Purchaser will hold all information and documents provided to it
under this Section 1.3 in confidence in accordance with the letter agreement
regarding confidentiality, by and between Parent and the Company, dated
November 3, 2014 (as amended or waived to date, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and will use such information and documents only in connection
with the Offer, and, if this Agreement has been terminated by Parent or
Purchaser, will return to the Company all such information and documents (and
all copies thereof).

 



 

Section 1.4. _Withholding_. Each of Parent and Purchaser will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to the Offer to any Company stockholders such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld therefrom under the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code **"** ), or the Treasury Regulations thereunder
or any other Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,

governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The parties hereto agree to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as

the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities, the following will
occur:

 



 

(a) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares described in Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares)
will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
Offer Price without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

 



 

(b) each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and each Share
owned by Parent, Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent or Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and retired without
any conversion thereof;

 



 

(c) each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one (1) share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation; and

 



 

(d) each Dissenting Share immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and Dissenting Shares
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which
reference is made in Section 3.3.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated 2002 Directors Equity Incentive
Plan, the Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, the Amended and
Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan and the ESPP (the " _Company Equity Plans_ "
and each such plan, a " _Company Equity Plan_ ") has adopted, or, as soon as
practicable following the date hereof (and, in any event, prior to the
Acceptance Time), will adopt, resolutions, and the Company will take all other
actions as may be required, to provide that:

 



 

(i) each option to acquire Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") and other
equity award measured by the value of Shares (or pursuant to which Shares may
be delivered) granted under a Company Equity Plan, in all cases other than
awards under the ESPP (collectively, " _Company Equity Awards_ "), that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, whether or
not then subject to any performance or other condition, will vest in full at
the Acceptance Time. For the avoidance of doubt, in effecting the accelerated
vesting of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 3.2, in the case of
any Company Equity Awards that remain subject to performance goals as of the
Acceptance Time (the " _PRSUs_ "), such performance goals will be deemed to
have been achieved such that (A) one-hundred percent (100%) of Shares subject
to the PRSUs granted in calendar year 2013, and (B) eighty-three and one-third
(83.33%) of the maximum number of Shares that may be delivered under the PRSUs
granted in calendar year 2014 (the same portion that would be delivered upon
achievement at the 100% target level) are earned and included in the payment
to be made pursuant to this Section 3.2;

 



 

(ii) each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled, and, in exchange therefor, each
former holder of each such cancelled Company Stock Option will be entitled to
receive (without interest), in consideration of the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (less applicable tax withholdings
pursuant to Section 3.6) equal to the product of (x) the total number of
Shares subject to the Company Stock Option (determined, for the avoidance of
doubt, after giving effect to the accelerated vesting described in Section
3.2(a)(i) above) multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over
the exercise price per Share under such Company Stock Option (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Company Stock Option with an

 



      
 

 



 

exercise price that is greater than the Offer Price, such Company Stock Option
shall, at the Effective Time, automatically be forfeited for no consideration
in exchange therefor);

 



 

(iii) each Company Equity Award, other than a Company Stock Option, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and will
entitle the holder of such Company Equity Award to receive (without interest)
an amount in cash (less applicable tax withholdings pursuant to Section 3.6)
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to (or deliverable
under) such Company Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(determined, for the avoidance of doubt, after giving effect to the
accelerated vesting described in Section 3.2(a)(i) above) times (y) the Offer
Price; Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, in accordance with the
foregoing and the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plans pursuant to
which they were issued.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company will provide written notice to
all holders of Company Equity Awards, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, describing the treatment of such Company Equity Awards in accordance
with this Section 3.2 and the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and
will permit each holder of a Company Stock Option who desires to exercise all
or any portion of any such Company Stock Option (including any portion of
which is the subject of accelerated vesting in connection with the Merger)
following receipt of such notice to exercise such Company Stock Option prior
to the Acceptance Time.

 



 

(c) The Companys 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") will
continue to be operated in accordance with its terms and past practice for the
last Option Period (as defined in the ESPP) to begin prior to the date of this
Agreement (" _Current Option Period_ "); provided that, the Company will take
action (to the extent necessary) to provide that only participants in the ESPP
for the Current Option Period may continue to participate in the ESPP for the
remainder of the Current Option Period; and further provided that if the
Acceptance Time is expected to occur prior to the Exercise Date (as defined in
the ESPP) for the Current Option Period, the Company will take action to
provide for an earlier Exercise Date (including for purposes of determining
the Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) for the Current Option Period)
(such earlier date, the " _Early ESPP Exercise Date_ "). The Early ESPP
Exercise Date will be as close to the Acceptance Time as is administratively
practicable, and the Company will notify each participant in writing prior to
the Early ESPP Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Current Option
Period has been changed to the Early ESPP Exercise Date and that his or her
Option (as defined in the ESPP) will be exercised automatically on the Early
ESPP Exercise Date, unless prior to such date he or she has withdrawn from the
Option Period in accordance with Section 13 of the ESPP. The Company will
suspend the commencement of any future Option Periods under the ESPP unless
and until this Agreement is terminated and will terminate the ESPP as of the
Acceptance Time.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the

 



      
 

 



 

DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal. From and
after the Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised such
appraisal rights will not have any rights of a stockholder of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Shares, except those provided
under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of Dissenting Shares will be entitled
only to receive payment of the appraised value of such Shares held by him, her
or it in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right
to appraisal, in which case such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate or Certificates, pursuant to Section 3.1.

 



 

(b) The Company will give Parent prompt written notice of any demands for
appraisal (including copies of such demands), attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments received by the Company from holders of
Shares relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct the conduct of all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

 



 

(c) If any Company stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
stockholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholders
Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholders
Shares will no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, will be treated
as if the stockholder had, as of the Effective Time, been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as set forth in
Section 3.1(a).

 



 

Section 3.4. _Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Offer Price, and will cause the Paying Agent
to timely make, all payments contemplated in Section 3.4(b). Such cash may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investments will be in short-term obligations of the United States of America
with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. No loss
incurred with respect to such investments will decrease the amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement. Any portion of the cash made available to the
Paying Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent will mail to each holder of record
of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or a book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry
Share_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares, whose Shares were converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.4(b), each Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and will not evidence any interest in, or any right to
exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, Parent will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that
have been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed
to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders
will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of their Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares. The Surviving Corporation will pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Merger Consideration. If any Certificate or Book Entry Share has not been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
will be closed, and thereafter there will be no further registration of
transfers of Shares that were issued prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer will be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, this ARTICLE III.

 



 

(e) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the holders delivery of an affidavit of loss to the Paying Agent (and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be

 



   

     
 

 



 

reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the

of ERISA.

 



 

(f) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the

employee, officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

guidance (including proposed regulations notices, rulings and final

make such projections and other forecasts and plans and accordingly is not
relying on them, that each of Parent and Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties, that each of Parent and Purchaser is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and that each of Parent,
Purchaser and their Representatives will have no claim against any Person with
respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges that,
without limiting the generality of this Section 5.11(b), neither the Company
nor any Person acting on behalf of the Company has made any representation or
warranty with respect to such projections and other forecasts and plans.

directly or indirectly, from the date hereof until the Acceptance Time: (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries

reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any
negotiations with respect thereto, or (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal with any such Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any designees
of Parent or Purchaser), or provide any non-public information or

 



      
 

 



 

data to any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any designees of Parent or
Purchaser) relating to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person (other than Parent, Purchaser or
any designees of Parent or Purchaser). The Company and its Subsidiaries will,
and shall direct their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and, to the extent the Company is
contractually permitted to do so, will request the return or destruction of

Time, the Company may (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to a Person (and its Representatives) making a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company believes is bona fide and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) the Company will not, and will
instruct its Representatives not to, disclose any material non-public
information to such Person unless the Company has, or first enters into, a
customary confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms that, taken as a
whole, are not materially less restrictive to the other party than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of any Acquisition
Proposal), (B) the Company will, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person that was
not previously provided or made available to Parent and (C) the Company Board
or any committee thereof has determined in good faith based on the information
then available that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company will promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent in the event that the Company
receives any Acquisition Proposal or written indication by any Person that it
is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any discussions or
negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated. The Company will provide Parent promptly (and in any event within
such one (1) Business Day period) the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers or (in lieu thereof, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements, and the identity
of the Person or group of Persons making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry), in each case except to the extent that doing so would
violate any confidentiality agreement existing as of the date of this
Agreement. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations
(including by providing copies of additional written materials relating
thereto within one Business Day of receipt thereof).

 



 

(d) The Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation; or

 



 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(b), cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in compliance with Section 6.3(b)) (an
" _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board or any committee thereof may
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Change of Board Recommendation_ ) if (i) (x) the Company Board or any
committee thereof receives an Acquisition Proposal that it determines in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company Board or any committee
thereof determines in good faith that the failure to effect a Change of Board
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders under applicable Law or (y) an
Intervening Event occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith that the failure to effect a Change
of Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company stockholders under applicable Law; (ii) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Change of Board Recommendation,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change of Board
Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ); (iii) if applicable, the
Company has provided Parent a copy of all definitive agreements (including all
financing documents) with respect to such Superior Proposal; (iv) if requested
to do so by Parent, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good
faith, and shall have made its Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith, with Parents Representatives any bona fide proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
failure to make such Change of Board Recommendation would no longer be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board (and, if
applicable, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal)
during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day of delivery
by the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending three
Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (it being understood and agreed
that any bona fide amendment to any material term or condition of any Superior
Proposal shall require a new Recommendation Change Notice and a new two
Business Day period); and (v) no earlier than the end of the three business
day period following receipt of the Recommendation Change Notice by Parent,
the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification
to this Agreement, that the failure to effect a Change of Board Recommendation
would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company stockholders under applicable Law and, if applicable,
the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, the Acquisition Proposal that is subject of the Recommendation
Change Notice continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 will prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal made or renewed by
a Person or group at any time after the date hereof that is structured to
permit such Person or group to acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership of at least fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total voting power
or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or 15% or more of the
consolidated total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of
the Company (measured by any of the fair market value, consolidated net
revenue, consolidated net income or consolidated book value thereof), in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any
proposal or offer with respect to the issuance by the Company of securities
representing more than 15% of the Shares outstanding, in each case, pursuant
to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of
capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar
transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of
related transactions, in each case other than the Offer and the Merger.

 



 

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was
not known to the Company Board or any committee thereof on the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known to the
Company Board or any committee thereof as of the date of this Agreement),
which event or circumstance, or any consequence thereof, becomes known to the
Company Board or any committee thereof prior to the Acceptance Time; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, offer
or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal constitute an Intervening Event.

 



 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal that the Company
believes is bona fide (except the references in the definition thereof to
"fifteen percent (15%)" will be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made in
writing after the date hereof that the Company Board or any committee thereof
has determined in its good faith judgment (after taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the anticipated
timing and conditions related to such proposal (including any financing
condition or the reliability of any debt or equity funding commitments), and
the Person making the proposal) that if consummated would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by Section 6.3(d) and Section 8.3(b) of this Agreement).

 



 

Section 6.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on (I) December 31,
2015, in the event that the Effective Time occurs before February 28, 2015,
and (II) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, in the event that the
Effective Time occurs on or after February 28, 2015, to

 



      
 

 



 

maintain for the individuals employed by the Company at the Effective Time
(the " _Current Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and annual target cash
incentive compensation opportunity at least as favorable as at the Effective
Time, (ii) benefits (excluding severance compensation and benefits and also
excluding equity-based compensation and benefits), that are at least as
favorable in the aggregate as the benefits maintained for and provided to
Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under either the
Company Plans or employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates, at Parents sole discretion, and (iii) severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits provided under the Cubist
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2014 Severance Plan, effective December 7, 2014. To the
extent that the Company has not paid 2014 cash bonuses as of the Acceptance
Time, and the Acceptance Time occurs on or after December 31, 2014, the
Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, pay each Current Employee his or her unpaid 2014 cash bonus under the 2014
Short-Term Incentive Plan (the " _STIP_ ") or the Performance-Based Management
Incentive Plan (the " _MIP_ "), as applicable, as determined based upon actual
performance. The determination of actual performance and the payment of such
bonuses shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the STIP
or the MIP, as applicable (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any award
agreement issued thereunder), under which such bonuses were granted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum aggregate bonus payable under the
STIP and the MIP shall not exceed one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%)
of target for all participants in the STIP and the MIP.

 



 

(b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by Current Employees to the Company and its Subsidiaries, if
applicable, prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting
and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation
and other paid time-off and severance, if applicable) under employee benefit
plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to Current Employees after the Effective Time (but excluding the
Company Plans), to the same extent as such service was taken into account
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding Company Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time for those purposes; provided, that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Current Employees will not be
subject to any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition limitations
under any employee health benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior
to the Effective Time. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries, to give such Current Employees credit under such
employee health benefit plans for any eligible expenses incurred by such
Current Employees and their covered dependents under a Company Plan during the
portion of the year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying all
corresponding co-payment, co-insurance, deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Current Employees and their covered dependents
in respect of the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(c) No later than the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary, including causing the adoption of resolutions of the
Company Board, to terminate the Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the
" _Company 401(k) Plan_") and to

 



      
 

 



 

cause each Current Employee to become 100% vested in such Current Employees
accounts under the Company 401(k) Plan, effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that such resolutions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan have been
adopted by the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. As soon as administratively
feasible after the Effective Time (but in no case earlier than January 1,
2015, if the Effective Time occurs in calendar year 2014), Parent agrees to
take such actions necessary to permit eligible Current Employees to
participate in the Merck U.S. Savings Plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") and
the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of MSD (the " _Parent Cash Balance
Plan_ "). Without limiting the undertakings in Section 6.4(b), service by
eligible Current Employees for the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Acceptance Time shall be included for vesting, eligibility and cash balance
service points, but not for benefit accruals, under the Parent 401(k) Plan and
the Parent Cash Balance Plan. The Parent 401(k) Plan will provide for the
receipt of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined in the
Code) as soon as administratively feasible following the Effective Time for
each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who elects to transfer his or her
account under the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
to Parent a revised final 280G Estimate as of such date and assuming for such
purposes that such individuals employment were terminated on such date.

 



 

(e) No provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i) prohibit
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company
Plan or any other employee benefit plan in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law, (ii) require the Parent or the Surviving Corporation to keep
any person employed for any period of time, or (iii) constitute the
establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any Company Plan or employee
benefit plan, and no person participating in any such Company Plan or employee
benefit plan shall have any third party beneficiary or other rights with
respect to this Section 6.4.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Purchaser will cause the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
of present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company than
are currently provided in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which
provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals
until the later of (i) the expiration of the statutes of limitations
applicable to such matters and (ii) six (6) years from the Effective Time,
and, in the event that any Proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made
during such period, until the disposition of any such Proceeding or claim,
unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law,
in which case Parent agrees, and will cause the Surviving Corporation, to make
such changes to the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws as to have the
least adverse affect on the rights of the individuals referenced in this
Section 6.5.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or Company Plan, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless
each present (as of the Effective Time) or former director, officer and
employee of the Company (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all obligations to pay a judgment,
settlement, penalty, and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or
investigative, and whether formal or informal, arising out of or pertaining to
any action or omission, including any action or omission in connection with
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or of another entity if
such service was at the request of the Company, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. In the event of any such Proceeding, each Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
the Proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or Parent ( _provided_ , that
any Person to whom expenses are advanced will have provided, to the extent
required by the DGCL, an undertaking to repay such advances if it is finally
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification).

 



 

(c) The Company will purchase prior to the Effective Time tail policies to the
current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained at
such time by the Company, which tail policies (i) will be effective for a
period from the Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years
after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and (ii) will
contain coverage that is at least as protective to such directors and officers
as the coverage provided by such existing policies. Parent will cause such
policies to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the coverage described above cannot be
obtained, or can only be obtained by paying aggregate premiums in excess of
300% of the annual amount currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to provide as much coverage as
can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to 300% of the aggregate
annual amount currently paid by the Company for such coverage.

 



 

(d) This Section 6.5 will survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and will be enforceable by, any Person or entity referred
to in clause (a) of this Section 6.5. The indemnification and advancement
provided for in this Section 6.5 will not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which the Indemnified Party is entitled whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or majority of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will
assume the applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 



 

Section 6.6. _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, each party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all

 



      
 

 



 

actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree to (i) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
and all other filings required by applicable foreign Antitrust Laws with
respect to the Merger as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the

effect with no liability on the part of any party (or of any of its
Representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination will
relieve any Person of any liability for damages resulting from intentional
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b);

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b); or

 



 

(iii) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the making or existence of such Acquisition
Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced intention shall not have
been publicly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date) and thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by (x) Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(ii) with
respect to a breach of covenant or agreement that occurred prior to the
Expiration Date, (y) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(c), or (z) by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b);

 



 

then in any such case, the Company will promptly pay Parent a termination fee
of $250,000,000 (Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Parent.
Any payment required to be made (1) pursuant to clause (i) of this Section
8.5(c) will be paid immediately prior to or concurrently with such
termination, (2) pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.5(c) will be paid
no later than two

 



      
 

 



 

Business Days after such termination and (3) pursuant to clause (iii) of this
Section 8.5(c) shall not be payable to Parent unless and until, within 12
months of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (substituting,
in each case, "50%" for "15%" in the definition thereof). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company will not be required to pay the termination fee more than
once.

 



 

(d) Parents right to receive the termination fee from the Company pursuant to
this Section 8.5 and Parents right to specific performance pursuant to
Section 9.13 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates. If Parent receives a termination fee pursuant to
Section 8.5(c), the collection of such fee will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Purchaser in respect of any breach of, or inaccuracy
contained in, the Companys covenants, agreements, representations or
warranties in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.5(c)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent or Purchaser would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c) and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Purchaser commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any portion thereof, the
Company shall pay to Parent or Purchaser interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment.

 



 

Section 8.6. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
each party will bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 8.7. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
Purchaser accepts for purchase any Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment
will be made that decreases the Merger Consideration. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.8. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance by the other
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein, except that the
Minimum Tender Condition may only be waived by Parent or Purchaser with the
prior written consent of the Company. Any such extension or waiver will be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

terms, no party hereto will be permitted to make any claim or commence any
Proceeding seeking monetary damages against any other party hereto in
connection with or arising out of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger;
_provided_ , that the foregoing will be without prejudice to the right of any
party to seek such monetary damages following such termination in accordance
with, and subject to the limitations set forth in, this Agreement.

 _Annex I_

 



 

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this Annex I and not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is attached (the "
_Merger Agreement_ ").

 



 

1. Purchaser will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection with the Offer, unless, immediately prior to then applicable Expiration Date:

 



 

(a) there have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn
that number of Shares that, together with the number of Shares, if any, then
owned beneficially by Parent and Purchaser (together with their wholly-owned
Subsidiaries), constitutes at least one Share more than one-half (1/2) of all
Shares then-outstanding as of the Expiration Date (such condition in this
Paragraph 1(a) being, the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); _provided_ that for
purposes of determining whether the Minimum Tender Condition has been
satisfied, Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in satisfaction of such guarantee
will be excluded; and

 



 

(b) (i) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the Antitrust
Laws listed on Annex I-1(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement has expired or been terminated and
(ii) the authorization or confirmation set forth on Annex I-1(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall have been obtained.

 



 

2. Additionally, Purchaser will not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection with the Offer if, immediately prior to the then applicable Expiration Date, any of the following conditions exist:

 



 

(a) there has been any Law, decree, judgment, order or injunction,
promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by any Governmental
Entity that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the making or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

 



 

(b) (i) the Company has breached or failed to comply in any material respect
with any of its covenants, or agreements under the Merger Agreement, and
either such breach or failure to comply is not capable of being cured within
twenty (20) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure or, if such breach or failure is capable of being cured
within such period, it has not been cured within such period; or (ii) the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
4.3(a) and 4.3(b) (Capitalization) and Section 4.4(a) (Authority)) that (x)
are not made as of a specific date are not true and correct as of the
Expiration Date, as though made on and as of the Expiration Date, and (y) are
made as of a

 



      
 

 



 

specific date are not true as of such date, in each case, except, in the case
of (x) or (y), where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect") has not had, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or (iii) the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) (Capitalization) and Section 4.4(a) (Authority)
shall not have been true and correct in all respects, except for de minimis
inaccuracies, as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date
and time (except to the extent that any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty shall not have been true and correct as of such earlier date);

 



 

(c) the Company shall not have delivered to Parent dated as of the Expiration
Date a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by a senior executive
officer of the Company to the effect that the conditions set forth in
Paragraph (2)(b) have been satisfied as of immediately prior to the Expiration
Date;

 



 

(d) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
event, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(e) the Merger Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms.

 



 

The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

 



 

The conditions set forth in Paragraph 2 of this _Annex I_ are for the benefit
of Parent and Purchaser and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or
in part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the Expiration
Date, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The foregoing conditions
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, the rights and obligations
of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate or modify the Offer subject to,
and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
unless such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of
directors of this corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this
paragraph 8 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid
by this corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in
defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an
"Advancement of Expenses"); provided, however, that, if the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware so requires, an Advancement of
Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to this
corporation of an undertaking (an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (a "Final Adjudication") that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this paragraph 8 or otherwise.

 



 

b. If a claim under paragraph 8(a) hereof is not paid in full by this
corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by this
corporation, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the Indemnitee may at
any time thereafter bring suit against this corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by this corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an
Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by
this corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses, whether pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking or otherwise, this corporation shall be entitled
to recover such expenses upon a Final

 



      
 

 



 

Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Neither the failure of this corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, nor an actual determination by this corporation (including its board
of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such
suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or by this
corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses, whether pursuant to the
terms of an Undertaking or otherwise, the burden of proving that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of
Expenses, under this paragraph 8 or otherwise shall be on this corporation.

 



 

9. _Records_. The books of this corporation may (subject to any statutory requirements) be kept outside the State of Delaware as may be designated by the board of directors or in the bylaws of this corporation.

 



 

10. _Meeting of Stockholders of Certain Classes_. If at any time this corporation shall have a class of stock registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, for so long as such class is so registered, any action by the stockholders of such class must be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent.

 



 

11. _Renunciation of Business Opportunities Doctrine_. To the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the law of the State of Delaware, this corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of the corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to its officers, directors or stockholders, other than those officers, directors or stockholders who are employees of this corporation. No amendment or repeal of this paragraph 11 shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any officer, director or stockholder of the corporation for or with respect to any opportunities of which such officer, director or stockholder becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any share of capital stock of the corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this paragraph 12. As used herein, " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust association or any other entity.

incorporation and the bylaws as from time to time in effect.

 



 

Section 2. STOCKHOLDERS

 



 

2.1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of
directors and the transaction of other business shall be held on such date and
at such place (if any) as may be designated by the board of directors. At each
annual meeting the stockholders entitled to vote shall elect a board of
directors and may transact such other proper business as may come before the
meeting. In lieu of holding an annual meeting of stockholders at a designated
place, the board of directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that any
annual meeting of stockholders be held solely by means of remote
communication.

 



 

2.2. _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called
at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or the board
of directors. A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the
secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the
secretary, by an assistant secretary or some other officer, upon application
of a majority of the directors. Any such application shall state the purpose
or purposes of the proposed meeting. Any such call shall state the place (if
any), date, hour and purposes of the meeting. In lieu of holding a special
meeting of stockholders at a designated place, the board of directors may, in
its sole discretion, determine that any special meeting of stockholders be
held solely by means of remote communication.

 



 

2.3. _Remote Communications_. For purposes of these bylaws, if authorized by
the board of directors (which authorization shall be in the board of
directors sole discretion), and subject to such guidelines and procedures as
the board of directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders may, by means
of remote communication:

 



 

(a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

 



 

(b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether
such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote
communication, provided, that (i) the corporation shall implement reasonable
measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at
the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder,
(ii) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide

 



      
 

 



 

such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including,
without any limitation, an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the
meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any
stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means
of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be
maintained by the corporation.

 



 

2.4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, a written
notice of each meeting of stockholders stating the place, day and hour thereof
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the meeting is
called, shall be given not less than one nor more than sixty days before the
meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat, and to each stockholder
who, by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, is
entitled to notice, by leaving such notice with him or at his residence or
usual place of business, by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, and addressed to such stockholder at his address as it appears in the
records of the corporation, or by sending it to him via email or facsimile at
his residence or usual place of business. Such notice shall be given by the
secretary, or by an officer or person designated by the board of directors, or
in the case of a special meeting by the officer calling the meeting. As to any
adjourned session of any meeting of stockholders, notice of the adjourned
meeting need not be given if the time and place thereof are announced at the
meeting at which the adjournment was taken except that if the adjournment is
for more than thirty days or if after the adjournment a new record date is set
for the adjourned session, notice of any such adjourned session of the meeting
shall be given in the manner heretofore described. No notice of any meeting of
stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be given to a stockholder
if a written waiver of notice, or a waiver by electronic transmissions by such
stockholder, executed before or after the meeting or such adjourned session by
such stockholder, is filed with the records of the meeting or if the
stockholder attends such meeting without objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose
of, any meeting of the stockholders or any adjourned session thereof need be
specified in any written waiver of notice.

 



 

2.5. _Quorum of Stockholders_. At any meeting of the stockholders a quorum as
to any matter shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on
the matter, except where a larger quorum is required by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws. Any meeting may be adjourned
from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question,
whether or not a quorum is present. If a quorum is present at an original
meeting, a quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of that meeting.
Shares of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
any corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 



 

2.6. _Action by Vote_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a plurality of
the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect to such office
and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than an
election to an office shall decide the question, except when a larger vote is
required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these

 



      
 

 



 

bylaws. No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a
stockholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in the
election.

 



 

2.7. _Action without Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders
for or in connection with any corporate action may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing
or electronic transmission, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of
votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware by hand, electronic delivery, or certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, to its principal place of business or to an officer
or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of stockholders are recorded. Each such written consent shall bear
the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent. No written or
electronic consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to
therein unless written or electronic consents signed by a number of
stockholders sufficient to take such action are delivered to the corporation
in the manner specified in this paragraph within sixty days of the earliest
dated consent so delivered.

 



 

If action is taken by consent of stockholders and in accordance with the
foregoing, there shall be filed with the records of the meetings of
stockholders the writing or writings comprising such consent. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, an electronic transmission consenting to action
to be taken by stockholders shall be deemed to be written, signed, and dated
for purposes of these bylaws so long as it is reduced to paper form (if
required by applicable law), sets forth or is delivered with such information
as may be required by applicable law, and is transmitted or delivered to the
corporation in the manner provided by applicable law or in any resolutions
adopted by the board of directors governing the submission of stockholder
consents by electronic transmission.

 



 

If action is taken by less than unanimous consent of stockholders, prompt
notice of the taking of such action without a meeting shall be given to those
who have not consented in writing and a certificate signed and attested to by
the secretary that such notice was given shall be filed with the records of
the meetings of stockholders.

 



 

In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have
required the filing of a certificate under any provision of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, if such action had been voted upon
by the stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such
provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision
concerning a vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given under
Section 228 of said General Corporation Law and that written notice has been
given as provided in such Section 228.

 



 

2.8. _Proxy Representation_. Every stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a stockholder is
entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting
to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or by his
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it

 



      
 

 



 

states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be
made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled
is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the corporation
generally. The authorization of a proxy may but need not be limited to
specified action; provided, however, that if a proxy limits its authorization
to a meeting or meetings of stockholders, unless otherwise specifically
provided such proxy shall entitle the holder thereof to vote at any adjourned
session but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof.

 



 

2.9. _Inspectors_. The directors or the person presiding at the meeting may,
and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors of
election and any substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best
of his ability. The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares
of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock
represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect
of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine
all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote,
count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and
do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to
all stockholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the
inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter
determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.

 



 

2.10. _List of Stockholders_. The secretary shall prepare and make, at least
ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in his name. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who
are stockholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by
proxy at such meeting.

 



 

Section 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 



 

3.1. _Number_. The corporation shall have one or more directors, the number of
directors to be determined from time to time by vote of a majority of the
directors then in office. Except in connection with the election of directors
at the annual meeting of stockholders, the number of directors may be
decreased only to eliminate vacancies by reason of death, resignation or
removal of one or more directors. No director need be a stockholder.

 



 

3.2. _Tenure_. Except as otherwise provided by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these bylaws, each director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting and until his successor is elected and qualified, or until
he sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.

 



 

3.3. _Powers_. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by
or under the direction of the board of directors who shall have and may
exercise all the powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws
directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



   

     
 

 



 

3.4. _Vacancies_. Unless otherwise provided for in the certificate of
incorporation, vacancies and any newly created directorships resulting from
any increase in the number of directors may be filled by vote of the holders
of the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such director at
a meeting called for the purpose, or by a majority of the directors then in
office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, in each
case elected by the particular class or series of stock entitled to elect such
directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the board, effective
at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those
who have resigned, who were elected by the particular class or series of stock
entitled to elect such resigning director or directors shall have power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote or action by writing thereon to take
effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective. The
directors shall have and may exercise all their powers notwithstanding the
existence of one or more vacancies in their number, subject to any
requirements of law or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws
as to the number of directors required for a quorum or for any vote or other
actions.

whole board, (a) designate, change the membership of or terminate the

members of any such committee who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee; and (c) determine the extent to which
each such committee shall have and may exercise the powers of the board of
directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,
including the power to authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to
all papers which require it and the power and authority to declare dividends
or to authorize the issuance of stock; excepting, however, such powers which
by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws they are
prohibited from so delegating. In the absence or disqualification of any
member of such committee and his alternate, if any, the member or members
thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not constituting a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board
of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Except as the board of directors may otherwise determine,
any committee may make rules for the conduct of its business, but unless
otherwise provided by the board or such rules, its business shall be conducted
as nearly as may be in the same manner as is provided by these bylaws for the
conduct of business by the board of directors. Each committee shall keep
regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the board of directors
upon request.

 



 

3.6. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be
held without call or notice at such places within or without the State of
Delaware and at such times as the board may from time to time determine,
provided that notice of the first regular meeting following any such
determination shall be given to absent directors. A regular meeting of the
directors may be held without call or notice immediately after and at the same
place as the annual meeting of stockholders.

addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, or by electronic
communication or

 



      
 

 



 

facsimile transmission at least five days before the date on which the meeting
is to be held, or shall be sent to him at such place by e-mail or facsimile,
or be delivered personally or by telephone, not later than the day before the
day on which such meeting is to be held. Each such notice shall state the time
and place of the meeting. Notice of any meeting of the board of directors need
not be given to any director if he shall sign a written waiver of notice or a
waiver by electronic transmission thereof either before or after the time
stated therein for such meeting, or if he shall be present at the meeting.
Neither notice of a meeting nor a waiver of a notice need specify the purposes
of the meeting.

 



 

3.8. _Quorum_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the certificate
of incorporation or by these bylaws, at any meeting of the directors, a
majority of the directors then in office shall constitute a quorum; a quorum
shall not in any case be less than one-third of the total number of directors
constituting the whole board. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time
by a majority of the votes cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is
present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice.

 



 

3.9. _Action by Vote_. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, by the
certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, when a quorum is present at
any meeting the vote of a majority of the directors present shall be the act
of the board of directors.

 



 

3.10. _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the board of directors or a committee thereof may be taken
without a meeting if all the members of the board or of such committee, as the
case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and
such writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the
records of the meetings of the board or of such committee. Such consent shall
be treated for all purposes as the act of the board or of such committee, as
the case may be.

 



 

3.11. _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone_. Members of the
board of directors, or any committee designated by such board, may participate
in a meeting of such board or committee by means of conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating
in the meeting can hear each other or by any other means permitted by law.
Such participation shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

3.12. _Compensation_. In the discretion of the board of directors, each
director may be paid such fees for his services as director and be reimbursed
for his reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties as
director as the board of directors from time to time may determine. Nothing
contained in this section shall be construed to preclude any director from
serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving reasonable
compensation therefor.

 



 

3.13. _Interested Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) No contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its
directors or officers, or between the corporation and any other corporation,
partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of the
corporations directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the
meeting of the

 



      
 

 



 

board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or
solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

 



 

(1) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors
or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorizes the

disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than
a quorum; or

 



 

(2) The material facts as to his relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or

 



 

(3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time
it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee
thereof, or the stockholders.

 



 

(b) Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence
of a quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction

ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he
were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the time of its issue.

 



 

7.2. _Loss of Certificates_. In the case of the alleged theft, loss,
destruction or mutilation of a certificate of stock, a duplicate certificate
may be issued in place thereof, upon such terms, including receipt of a bond
sufficient to indemnify the corporation against any claim on account thereof,
as the board of directors may prescribe.

 



 

Section 8. TRANSFER OF SHARES OF STOCK

 



 

8.1. _Transfer on Books_. Subject to the restrictions, if any, stated or noted
on the stock certificate, shares of stock may be transferred on the books of
the corporation by the surrender to the corporation or its transfer agent of
the certificate therefor properly endorsed or accompanied by a written
assignment and power of attorney properly executed, with necessary transfer
stamps affixed, and with such proof of the authenticity of signature as the
board of directors or the

 



      
 

 



 

transfer agent of the corporation may reasonably require. Except as may be
otherwise required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these
bylaws, the corporation shall be entitled to treat the record holder of stock
as shown on its books as the owner of such stock for all purposes, including
the payment of dividends and the right to receive notice and to vote or to
give any consent with respect thereto and to be held liable for such calls and
assessments, if any, as may lawfully be made thereon, regardless of any
transfer, pledge or other disposition of such stock until the shares have been
properly transferred on the books of the corporation.

 



 

It shall be the duty of each stockholder to notify the corporation of his post
office address.

 



 

8.2. _Record Date_. In order that the corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders
or any adjournment thereof, the board of directors may fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which record date
shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such
meeting. If no such record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

 



 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of
directors. If no such record date has been fixed by the board of directors,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of
directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by
delivery to its registered office in Delaware by hand or certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, to its principal place of business
or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in
which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date
has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of
directors is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

 



 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or
exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of
directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record
date shall be not more than

 



      
 

 



 

sixty days prior to such payment, exercise or other action. If no such record
date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of
directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

Section 9. CORPORATE SEAL

 



 

9.1. Subject to alteration by the directors, the seal of the corporation shall
consist of a flat-faced circular die with the word "Delaware" and the name of
the corporation cut or engraved thereon, together with such other words, dates
or images as may be approved from time to time by the directors.

 



 

Section 10. EXECUTION OF PAPERS

 



 

10.1. Except as the board of directors may generally or in particular cases
authorize the execution thereof in some other manner, all deeds, leases,
transfers, contracts, bonds, notes, checks, drafts or other obligations made,
accepted or endorsed by the corporation shall be signed by the chairman of the
board, if any, the president, a vice president or the treasurer.

 



 

Section 11. FISCAL YEAR

 



 

11.1. The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on the last day of
December, or such other date as is determined by the Board.

 



 

Section 12. AMENDMENTS

 



 

12.1. These bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by vote of a majority
of the directors then in office or by vote of a majority of the voting power
of the stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Any bylaw, whether adopted,
amended or repealed by the stockholders or directors, may be amended or
reinstated by the stockholders or the directors.

 



 

Section 13. FORUM

 



 

13.1. Unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and
only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and
only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive
forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the
corporation against any director or officer or other employee of the
corporation, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the
corporation to the corporation or the corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action or proceeding asserting a claim against the corporation or any director
or officer or other employee of the corporation arising pursuant to, or
seeking to enforce any right, obligation, or remedy under, any provision of
the General Corporate Law of the State of Delaware, the certificate of
incorporation, or these bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time),
(iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the
validity of any provision or provisions of the certificate of incorporation or
these bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), or (v) any action or
proceeding asserting a claim against the corporation or any director or
officer or other employee

 



      
 

 



 

of the corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to
the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the courts having personal
jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants.
