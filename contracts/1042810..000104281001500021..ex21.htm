AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 31, 2001,
between Equity One, Inc., a Maryland corporation ( _"Equity One"_ ), and
United Investors Realty Trust, a Texas real estate investment trust (the "
_ Company_ ").  
  

RECITALS  
  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Equity One and the Board of Trust Managers
of the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders or shareholders for Equity One to acquire the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;  
  

WHEREAS, the Board of Trust Managers of the Company has adopted resolutions
approving the acquisition of the Company by Equity One, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and has agreed to recommend that the
Company\'s shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby;  
  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Equity One has adopted resolutions
approving the acquisition of the Company by Equity One, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and has agreed to recommend that Equity
One\'s shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby;  
  

WHEREAS, Equity One and the Company have agreed (subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement) as soon as practicable to effect the Merger of
the Company with and into Equity One pursuant to Sections 23.10, 23.30, 23.40
and 23.50 of the Texas Real Estate Investment Trust Act (the " _REIT Act_ ")
and Section 3-114 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), as
more fully described herein; and  
  

WHEREAS, Equity One and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement;  
  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
  

Article 1 
 The Merger  
   _

Section 1.1The Merger_   
  

. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the REIT Act and the MGCL, the Company shall be
merged with and into Equity One (the " _Merger_ ") as soon as
practicable following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 hereof. Equity One shall be the surviving
entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") under the name Equity One,
Inc. and shall continue its existence under the laws of Maryland. The separate
legal existence of the Company shall cease. The parties hereto may by mutual
agreement at any time change the method of effecting the combination between
Equity One and the Company (including the provisions of this Article 1) if and
to the extent the parties deem such change to be desirable; _provided,
however,_ that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of
Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.1(a)) as provided for in this
Agreement or (B) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
   _

Section 1.1 Consummation of the Merger_   
  

. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing with the County Clerk\'s Office in
Harris County, Texas duly executed Articles of Merger as required by the REIT
Act and by filing Articles of Merger with State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland as required by the MGCL, and shall take all such other
and further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger effective as
promptly as practicable. Prior to the filing referred to in this Section, a
closing (the " _Closing_ ") for the purpose of confirming all the foregoing
will be held at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, P.A., 1221 Brickell Avenue,
Miami, Florida 33131 (or such other place as the parties may agree) on a date
(the _"Closing Date"_ ) as soon as practicable, but in no event more than
three (3) business days, after the last of the conditions set forth in Article
6 shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement ( _provided, however,_ the Closing Date shall not occur prior to
September 16, 2001 without the consent of Equity One). The time the Merger
becomes effective in accordance with applicable law is referred to as the "
_Effective Time._ "  
   _

Section 1.1Effects of the Merge_   
  

. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the REIT Act and the MGCL and set forth herein.  
   _

Section 1.1 Charter and Bylaw_   
  

. The charter and the bylaws of Equity One immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Entity.  
   _

Section 1.1 Directors and Officer_   
  

. The directors and officers of Equity One immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving
Entity until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  
  

Article 2 
 Effects of the Merger  
   _

Section 2.1 Conversion of Share_   
  

.   
  

a) Each common share of beneficial interest in the Company, no par value (the
" _Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares owned by Equity One or any subsidiary of Equity One
or held in the treasury of the Company, all of which shall be canceled and
cease to exist, without consideration being payable therefor) shall, by virtue
of the Merger, be converted at the Effective Time into the following (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate representing
such Shares as provided in Section 2.6 and in each case subject to Section 2.3
hereof:  
  

i) for each Share with respect to which an election to receive shares of
common stock in Equity One, par value $0.01 per share (" _Equity One Shares_
"), has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Sections 2.2(c), (d)
and (e) (" _Electing Shares_ "), the right to receive a number of fully paid
and nonassessable Equity One Shares equal to the quotient of $7.30 divided by
the Reference Price (the " _Price Ratio_ "); for the purposes hereof, the "
_Reference Price_ " shall mean the weighted average trading price per share
of Equity One Shares as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange for all
transactions during the 20 trading days ending on (and inclusive of) the
business day immediately prior to the Closing; _provided, however,_ that the
Reference Price shall not be less than $11.30 per share, subject to Section
2.1(a)(ii), or greater than $12.50 per share; and  
  

ii) if, in accordance with the terms of Section 7.1(i), the Company has
elected to terminate this Agreement and Equity One has made a timely election
to proceed to Closing, then each holder of an Electing Share will have the
right to receive the number of Equity One Shares determined in accordance
with Section 2.1(a)(i), __plus__ an additional amount (the " _Make Whole
Amount_ ") equal to (A) $7.30 __minus__ (B) the product of (1) the Reference
Price, __multiplied by__ (2) the Price Ratio calculated by using a
Reference Price equal to $11.30; _provided, however_ , that Equity One may
elect, in its sole discretion, to pay the Make Whole Amount in cash or
additional Equity One Shares, or a combination thereof, as follows: (x) an
amount of cash per Share, if any, determined by Equity One, and (y) a number
of Equity One Shares equal to the quotient of (1) the Make Whole Amount less
the amount of cash, if any, paid pursuant to the preceding clause (x),
__divided by__ (2) the Reference Price; _provided, further_ , that Equity One
may not elect to pay an amount of cash pursuant to this Section 2(a)(ii) that
would otherwise cause Equity One Shares issued as merger consideration
to become taxable to the recipient thereof; and  
  

iii) for each such Share (other than an Electing Share), the right to receive
in cash from the Surviving Entity following the Merger an amount equal to
$7.30 (the " _Cash Election Price_ ").  
  

b) As of the Effective Time, all Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Shares shall, to the extent such
certificate represents such Shares, cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration, including any cash
in lieu of fractional Equity One Shares to be issued in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.6.  
   _

Section 2.2 Elections_   
  

.   
  

a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Date referred to in paragraph
(c) below, is a record holder of Shares will be entitled, with respect to all
or any portion of his Shares, to make an unconditional election (an "
_Equity One Share Election_ ") on or prior to such Election Date to receive
Equity One Shares (subject to Section 2.3) on the basis set forth herein.  
  

b) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement referenced in Section 5.6
hereof, Equity One shall appoint a bank or trust company acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of
the Merger Consideration.  
  

c) The Company shall prepare and mail a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Equity One (the " _Form of Election_ "),
with the Proxy Statement to the record holders of Shares as of the
record date for the Special Meeting of the Company\'s shareholders (as
defined below), which Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of
Shares who wishes to make an Equity One Share Election for any or all Shares
held, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3 hereof, by such holder. The
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election
and the Proxy Statement available to all persons who become holders of Shares
during the period between such record date and the Election Date referred to
below. Any such holder\'s Equity One Share Election shall have been properly
made only if the Paying Agent shall have received at its designated office, by
5:00 p.m., New York City time on the business day (the " _Election Date_ ")
next preceding the day on which the vote on the Shareholder Approval is taken
at the Special Meeting of the Company\'s shareholders a Form of Election
properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates for the Shares
to which such Form of Election relates (or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery of such certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a
firm which is a member of a registered national securities exchange or of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or
trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, provided
such certificates are in fact delivered to the Paying Agent within three New
York Stock Exchange trading days after the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery).  
  

d) Any Form of Election may be revoked by the shareholder submitting it to the
Paying Agent only by written notice received by the Paying Agent (i) prior to
5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Election Date or (ii) after the date
of the Special Meeting of the Company\'s shareholders, if (and to the extent
that) the Paying Agent is legally required to permit revocations and the
Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to such date. In addition, all
Forms of Election shall automatically be revoked if the Paying Agent is
notified in writing by Equity One and the Company that the Merger has been
abandoned. If a Form of Election is revoked, the certificate or certificates
(or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate) for the Shares to which such Form
of Election relates shall be promptly returned to the shareholder submitting
the same to the Paying Agent.  
  

e) The determination of the Paying Agent shall be binding whether or not
Equity One Share Elections have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this
Section 2.2 with respect to Shares and when elections and revocations were
received by it. If the Paying Agent determines that any Equity One Share
Election was not properly made with respect to Shares, such Shares shall be
treated by the Paying Agent as Shares which were not Electing Shares at the
Effective Time, and such Shares shall be exchanged in the Merger for cash
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii). The Paying Agent shall also make all
computations as to the allocation and the proration contemplated by Section
2.3, and any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders
of Shares. The Paying Agent may, with the mutual agreement of Equity One and
the Company, make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.2 for the
implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable fully to effect such elections.   
   _

Section 2.3 Proration_   
  

.   
  

a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate
number of Shares to be converted into the right to receive Equity One Shares
as a result of the Merger shall be equal to 50% of the Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Non-Cash Share
Number_ ").  
  

b) If the number of Electing Shares exceeds the Non-Cash Share Number, then
each Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive Equity One
Shares or receive cash in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(a) in
the following manner:  
    

i) A proration factor (the " _Non-Cash Proration Factor_ ") shall be
determined by dividing the Non-Cash Share Number by the total number of
Electing Shares.    
    

ii) Subject to Section 2.5(e), the number of Electing Shares covered by each
Equity One Share Election to be entitled to receive Equity One Shares as a
result of the Merger (on a consistent basis among shareholders who made
the election referred to in Section 2.1(a)(i) pro rata to the number of
Shares as to which they made such elections) shall be equal to the product of
the Non-Cash Proration Factor multiplied by the total number of Electing
Shares covered by such Equity One Share Election.    
    

iii) Subject to Section 2.5(e), each Electing Share other than those shares to
be entitled to receive Equity One Shares as a result of the Merger in
accordance with Section 2.3(b)(ii) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price (on a consistent basis among shareholders who
made the election referred to in Section 2.1(a)(i), pro rata to the number of
shares as to which they made such election) as if such shares were not
Electing Shares in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(a)(iii).    
    

iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the number of Electing
Shares exceeds the Non-Cash Share Number, then Equity One reserves the right,
in its sole discretion, to increase the Non-Cash Share Number.    
  

c) If the number of Electing Shares is less than the Non-Cash Share Number,
then:  
    

i) All Electing Shares shall be entitled to receive Equity One Shares as a
result of the Merger in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(a)(i) and
2.1(a)(ii).    
    

ii) Subject to Section 2.5(e), additional Shares other than Electing Shares
shall be converted into a right to receive Equity One Shares as a result of
the Merger (on a consistent basis among shareholders who held Shares as to
which they did not make the election referred to in Section 2.1(a)(i) pro
rata to the number of such Shares as to which no such election had been made)
in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(a) in the following manner: the
number of Shares in addition to Electing Shares to be converted into a right
to receive Equity One Shares (the " _Non-Electing Shares_ ") (on a basis
consistent among shareholders who held Shares as to which they did not make
the election referred to in Section 2.1(a)(i) pro rata to the number of such
Shares as to which no such election had been made) shall be equal to the
excess of the Non-Cash Share Number over the number of Electing Shares.    
    

iii) Each other Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Price.     
   _

Section 2.4 Special Meeting_   
  

. The Company, acting through its Board of Trust Managers, and Equity One,
acting through its Board of Directors, shall, to the extent required by
applicable law to approve the Merger, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting (the " _Special Meetings_ ") of its shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, as soon as practicable for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement and the plan of merger (within the
meaning of the REIT Act) set forth in this Agreement and approving the Merger
(" _Shareholder Approval_ "), and, subject to the fiduciary duties of the
Company\'s Board of Trust Managers and Equity One\'s Board of Directors under
applicable law as advised by legal counsel, include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of such boards that the shareholders of the Company and the
stockholders of Equity One, as the case may be, vote in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement and
approval of the Merger. Equity One and the Company agree to use their
reasonable efforts to cause the Special Meetings to occur within forty-five
(45) days after the Company and Equity One have responded to all comments from
the Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Equity One agrees that, at the Special Meeting of the Company\'s
shareholders, all of the Shares now owned or hereafter acquired by Equity One
or any of its affiliates will be voted in favor of Shareholder Approval.  
   _

Section 2.5 Exchange of Certificates_   
  

.   
  

a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Equity One shall deposit funds in
trust with the Paying Agent in an aggregate amount equal to the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the
" _ Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments of the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration provided for in this Agreement pursuant to the Merger out of the
Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement.  
  

b) As of or promptly after the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates which prior thereto represented Shares shall, upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of such certificate or certificates
and acceptance thereof by the Paying Agent, be entitled to a certificate or
certificates representing the number of full Equity One Shares, if any, that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement and the amount
of cash, if any, into which the number of Shares previously represented by
such certificate or certificates surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall accept such certificates
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of certificates
representing Shares, and if such certificates are presented to the Surviving
Entity for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of cash and, if
appropriate, certificates for Equity One Shares. If any certificate for Equity
One Shares is to be issued in, or if cash is to be remitted to, a name other
than that in which the certificate for Shares surrendered for exchange is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Surviving Entity or its transfer agent any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such
Equity One Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Entity or its transfer agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b), each certificate
for Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by Section 2.1.  
  

c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Equity One Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate for Shares with respect to Equity One Shares that
the holder thereof is entitled to receive and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional Equity One Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.5(e) until the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this
Article 2. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of
any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole Equity One Shares issued in connection therewith, without
interest (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fraction of an Equity One Share to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and the proportionate amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid
with respect to such Equity One Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole Equity
One Shares.  
  

d) All cash paid and Equity One Shares issued upon the surrender for exchange
of certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article 2 (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5(e)) shall be deemed
to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares theretofore represented by such certificates.  
  

e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of an
Equity One Share in exchange for Shares in the Merger (after taking into
account all Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
a cash payment (without interest) equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Reference Price.  
  

f) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders
of the certificates representing Shares for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity and any holders of Shares prior
to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall
thereafter look to the Surviving Entity (subject to the abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration per Share, without any interest thereon.  
  

g) Equity One may cause the Paying Agent to invest the cash included in the
Payment Fund in short-term obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, the United
States of America, investment grade commercial paper or other
similar investments, but in any event Equity One shall ensure that the terms
and conditions of any such investment shall be such as to permit the Paying
Agent to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Agreement. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Equity One shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the
Payment Fund lost through investments or other events, so as to ensure that
the Payment Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.  
  

h) The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent.  
   _

Section 2.6 Rights Under Share Plan_   
  

. At the Effective Time, each holder of a then outstanding option (including
share purchase rights and options granted to trust managers) to purchase
Shares, including under any employee benefit plan or share plan (the " _Share
Plans _ "), each holder of any other right to receive Shares subject to
vesting, settlement or other conditions (whether or not conditioned upon the
payment of consideration by such holder), and each holder of any securities
convertible into or exercisable for Shares, whether or not such options,
rights or securities are then vested or exercisable, or such elections have
been fulfilled or honored or such restrictions have lapsed or terminated (the
" _Rights_ "), shall, in settlement thereof, receive for each Share subject to
any such Right an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger
Consideration over the per Share exercise or purchase price of such Right, if
any, to the extent such difference is a positive number (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Right Consideration_ "); _provided, however_
, that with respect to any person subject to Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), to the extent that
the payment or the right to receive payment with respect to the Rights (or
the Shares relating thereto) would cause such person to have any liability
under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Board of Trust Managers shall take
such actions as may be necessary to exempt such transactions from Section
16(b) pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The Surviving Entity
shall cause the Right Consideration to be paid within 5 business days after
the Effective Time. Upon receipt of the Right Consideration, the Right
shall be canceled. The surrender of a Right to the Company in exchange for
the Right Consideration shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the
holder had or may have had in respect of such Right. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents or releases from holders of Rights under the Share Plans or otherwise
and take all such other action requested by Equity One, consistent with
applicable law and the terms of the Share Plans and the Rights as may be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.6.
The foregoing shall not limit or affect any provision of a Share Plan that
would accelerate the vesting of any Right or prevent the
acceleration, settlement, or exercise of any Right that would otherwise be
required or permitted pursuant to the terms of a Share Plan (whether by reason
of the consummation of the Merger or otherwise). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all action necessary to terminate the Share Plans,
which termination shall be effective prior to or at the Effective Time.  
  

Article 3 
 Representations and Warranties

inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will, at
the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act
or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or

acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material

effect on the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; or (v) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or by which any of their respective assets are bound, except for
violations which would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect or
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
   _

Section 3.9 Brokers_   
  

. No broker, finder or other investment banker (other than First Union
Securities, Inc. (" _First Union_ "), a copy of whose engagement letters have

Restrictions disclosed on existing title policies or existing surveys (in
either case copies of which title policies and surveys have been made

materialmen\'s liens and other Encumbrances, Property Restrictions and other
limitations of any kind, if any, which, individually or in the aggregate, are
not substantial in amount, do not materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the present use of any of the Company Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby, and do not otherwise have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as provided in Section 3.10 to the Disclosure Letter,
(A) the Company has no knowledge that any material certificate, permit or
license, from any governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction
over any of the Company Properties or any agreement, easement or other right
which is necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of the buildings and

Properties in amounts at least equal to the purchase price of such Company
Properties at the time of the issuance of such policy, subject only to the
matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, and such policies are in full
force and effect and no material claim has been made against any such policy.
An on-the-ground survey of any of the Company Properties, if made prior to the
Effective Time and prepared in accordance with ALTA/ACSM (or the applicable
state equivalent) standards (it being understood that no such surveys are
required hereunder), would not disclose any Encumbrance, Property Restriction
or other matter affecting title which is not currently shown on an existing
survey of such Company Property and which could materially adversely affect
the value or operation of such Company Property.  
  

c) Each Company Property (i) complies in all material respects with the
Property Restrictions, or to the extent that such Company Property does not so

plain, or if any such improvement lies within a flood plain, adequate
insurance therefor is in full force and effect, and (iii) each Company

investigation has been threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any other person for whom the Company
or any of its subsidiaries would be liable before any court or governmental or
regulatory authority which, in the aggregate, (i) could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) could reasonably be expected to

   _

Section 3.12 Tax Matters_   
  

.   
  

a) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has filed all tax returns and
reports required to be filed by it, or requests for extensions to file such
tax returns or reports have been timely filed and granted and have not expired
and all such tax returns and reports are accurate and complete in all
material respects. The Company and each of its subsidiaries has paid (or the
Company has paid on its behalf) or made provision for all taxes shown as due
on such tax returns and reports. The most recent financial statements
contained in the SEC Reports reflect adequate reserves in all material
respects for all taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of
such financial statements, and no deficiencies for any taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
that are not adequately reserved for in all material respects. No requests for
waivers of the time to assess any taxes against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries have been granted or are pending, except for requests with
respect to such taxes that have been adequately reserved for in the most
recent financial statements contained in the SEC Reports, or, to the extent
not adequately reserved, the assessment of which would not, in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement the term "taxes"
includes all federal, state, local and foreign income, franchise, property,
sales, use, excise and other taxes, including without limitation obligations
for withholding taxes from payments due or made to any other person and any
interest, penalties or additions to tax.  
  

b) All taxes which the Company or its subsidiaries are required by law to
withhold or collect, including taxes required to have been withheld in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any officer, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use
taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid over to the proper governmental authorities or are held in separate
bank accounts for such purpose. There are no liens for taxes upon the assets
of the Company or its subsidiaries except for statutory liens for taxes not
yet due.  
  

c) Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Letter, the tax
returns of the Company and its subsidiaries are not being and have not been
examined or audited by any taxing authority for any past year or periods.  
  

d) Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries (i) have filed a consent under
Section 341(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the _"Code"_
), concerning collapsible corporations, or (ii) are a party to any tax
allocation or sharing agreement.  
  

e) Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have any liability for the taxes
of any person other than the Company and its subsidiaries (i) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor, (iii) by contract, or
(iv) otherwise.  
  

f) Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have made any payments, are
obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement that could
obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code.  
  

g) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has entered into or is
subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreements. As used
herein, a " _Tax Protection Agreement_ " is an agreement, oral or written (i)
 that has as one of its purposes to permit a person or entity to take the
position that such person or entity could defer federal taxable income that
otherwise might have been recognized upon a transfer of property to any
subsidiary of the Company that is treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes, and (ii) that (A) prohibits or restricts in any manner the
disposition of any assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, requiring the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to indemnify any person for tax liabilities resulting from any
such disposition), (B) requires that the Company or any of its subsidiaries
maintain, or put in place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or not secured by
one or more of the Company Properties, or (C) requires that the Company or
any of its subsidiaries offer to any person or entity at any time the
opportunity to guarantee or otherwise assume, directly or indirectly, the risk
of loss for federal income tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  
  

h) The Company (A) for all taxable years commencing with the taxable year
ended December 31, 1996 through December 31, 2000, has been organized in
conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment
trust (a "  _REIT_ ") (within the meaning of the Code) under the Code and has
been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to
operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending
at the Effective Time, and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action
which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge to its status as a
REIT, and to the Company\'s knowledge, no such challenge is pending or
threatened. Each subsidiary of the Company which is a partnership, joint
venture or limited liability company has been treated during and since its
formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
partnership or disregarded as an entity separate from its owner and not as a
corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. Each subsidiary of the
Company which is a corporation for federal income tax purposes and with
respect to which all of the outstanding capital stock is owned solely by the
Company (or solely by a subsidiary of the Company that is a corporation wholly
owned by the Company) is a "qualified REIT subsidiary," as defined in Section
856(i) of the Code.  
   _

Section 3.13 Compliance with Law_   
  

. Except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Disclosure Letter or in the SEC

order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any subsidiary or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any subsidiary is bound or
affected. Except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Disclosure Letter or in
the SEC Reports, the Company and its subsidiaries have all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals and franchises from governmental
agencies required to conduct their businesses as now being conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "). Except as set forth in Section 3.13 of the Disclosure
Letter or in the SEC Reports, the Company and its subsidiaries are in material
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits.

its subsidiaries have obtained and are operating in material compliance with
all material permits necessary under any Environmental Law for the conduct

and Costs (as defined in Section 8.11 hereof) of any person, corporation or
other entity or (C) required to take material Remedial Action (as defined in

third party exposure to Hazardous Materials; (vi) the operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries involving the generation, transportation,
treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous or solid waste, as defined and
regulated under 40 C.F.R. Parts 260-270 (in effect as of the date hereof) or
any applicable state equivalent, are in material compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws; (vii) there is not on or in any property of the Company or
its subsidiaries or any property for which the Company or its subsidiaries
are potentially liable any of the following: (A) any underground storage
tanks or surface impoundments or (B) any on-site disposal of Hazardous
Material; and (viii) no Company Property is included or, to the knowledge of
the Company, proposed for inclusion on the National Priorities List issued
pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, a amended (" _CERCLA_ "), by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (the " _EPA_ ") or on the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System database
maintained by the EPA, and the Company has no knowledge that any Company
Property has otherwise been identified in a published writing by the EPA as a
potential CERCLA removal, remedial or response site or, to the knowledge of
the Company, proposed for inclusion on any similar list of potentially
contaminated sites pursuant to any other Environmental Law.   
   _

failure to remedy an existing breach or failure to comply within ten business
days) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), (ii) by Equity

proposal for an Acquisition Transaction and within twelve (12) months after
the date of termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement with

$2,000,000. The escrow agent shall pay to Equity One an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the Termination Fee and (ii) the maximum amount that can be paid
to Equity One without causing Equity One to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such
amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the
independent accountants of Equity One. In the event that all or any portion of
the Termination Fee remains in escrow after payment of the amount, if any,
required by the preceding sentence, the escrow agreement shall provide that
Equity One shall not be entitled to the remainder of the Termination Fee and
no amount thereof shall be released to Equity One unless and until the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from
Equity One\'s outside counsel indicating that it has received a ruling from
the IRS the effect of which holds that Equity One\'s receipt of the
Termination Fee would not jeopardize its status as a REIT (" _REIT
Requirements_ "), and that receipt by Equity One of the remaining balance of
the Termination Fee following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling would
not be deemed constructively received prior thereto (in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Fee in escrow to Equity
One) or (ii) a letter (or a series of letters) from the independent
accountants of Equity One, each indicating any additional amounts that Equity
One can be entitled to and can be paid at that time without causing it to
fail to meet the REIT Requirements (in which case the escrow agent shall
release such additional amounts from escrow to Equity One). The obligation of
the Company to pay any unpaid portion of the Termination Fee shall terminate
three years from the date hereof, and any unpaid portion of the Termination
Fee remaining in escrow three years from the date hereof shall be released to
the Company and the escrow shall terminate at that time.  
   _

Section 7.4 Amendment_   
  

. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
action taken by or on behalf of the Board of Trust Managers of the Company and
the Boards of Directors of Equity One at any time before or after adoption
of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company but, after any such
shareholder approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Company\'s
shareholders hereunder without the approval of the shareholders of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of all of the parties.  
   _

survive beyond the Effective Time. This Section 8.1 shall not limit any

   _

Section 8.2 Entire Agreement; Assignment_   
  

. Except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Letter, this
Agreement (a) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and (b) shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided, however_ , that Equity One may assign any of its
rights and obligations to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Equity One
incorporated under the laws of a state of the United States the corporate laws
of which provide for mergers of corporations of such state with a Texas real
estate investment trust, but no such assignment shall relieve Equity One, as
the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.  
   _

Section 8.3 Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction_
