subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein. As an inducement for
Simmons to enter into this Agreement, certain directors and executive
officers of First Texas have simultaneously herewith entered into Voting
Agreements (each a " _Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting
Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger, in the form of  _Exhibit A_
hereto. The transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the
approvals of the shareholders of First Texas and Simmons and applicable
regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of certain other conditions
described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the Parties to this
Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as a

owned First Texas Subsidiary, by Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiary (in each
case other than shares held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust
accounts or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result
of debts previously contracted (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ "))
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



   

5

 



    

  

(c)  Each share of First Texas Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the
Canceled Shares and the First Texas Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the following consideration, in each case without
interest:

  



  

(i)  the Per Share Cash Consideration; and

  



  

(ii)  the Per Share Stock Consideration (together with the Per
Share Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  



  

(d)  All shares of First Texas Common Stock, when so converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer books of First Texas that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of First Texas
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such First Texas
Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant
to Section 2.5 cash in lieu of fractional shares of Simmons Common Stock into
which such shares of First Texas Common Stock have been converted together
with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_.

  



  

(e)  Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement
and subject to Sections 6.2(c) and (d), if at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, First Texas should
(i) split, combine or otherwise reclassify the shares of First Texas Common
Stock, (ii) make a dividend or other distribution in shares of First Texas
Common Stock (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into First Texas Common Stock), (iii) engage in a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like
change, or (iv) issue additional shares of First Texas Common Stock or any
Equity Right for First Texas Common Stock, then (without limiting any other
rights of Simmons hereunder), the calculation of the First Texas Shares
Outstanding shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and
without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any such change.

  



  

2.2.  Anti-Dilution Provisions.

  



  

In the event Simmons changes the number of shares of Simmons Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such
stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the
effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Stock Consideration shall be equitably and
proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect
fully the effect of any such change.

  



  

2.3.  Treatment of First Texas Equity Awards and Unallocated ESOP
Shares.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each option granted by First Texas
to purchase shares of First Texas Common Stock under a First Texas Stock
Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _First Texas Stock Option_ ")
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Simmons a cash
payment equal to the applicable First Texas Stock Option Payout. Any First
Texas Stock Option with an Option Exercise Price that equals or exceeds
the sum of the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be canceled with no consideration being paid to the
optionholder with respect to such First Texas Stock Option. Simmons shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration payable in respect of the First Texas Stock
Options all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the
Internal Revenue Code or any provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign
Tax law.

  



   

6

 



    

  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each unit in respect of a share of
First Texas Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under a First Texas Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _First Texas Restricted Stock
Unit_ ") shall fully vest and shall be canceled and converted automatically
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) and treating the First Texas Restricted Stock Units as if they
are shares of First Texas Common Stock for such purposes. Simmons shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the First Texas
Restricted Stock Units all such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold under the Internal Revenue Code or any provisions of federal, state,
local, or foreign Tax law.

  



  

(c)  At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right
granted by First Texas under a First Texas Stock Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _First Texas SAR_ ")
shall fully vest and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the
right to receive from Simmons a cash payment equal to the applicable First
Texas SARs Payout.

  



  

(d)  Following the Effective Time, the Unallocated ESOP Shares
shall be canceled and Simmons shall pay to the trustee of the First Texas
BHC, Inc. and Subsidiaries Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _ESOP_ ") an
aggregate cash payment equal to the Aggregate Unallocated ESOP Payout.

  



  

(e)  At or prior to the Effective Time, First Texas, the board
of directors of First Texas and/or its compensation committee, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3.

  



  

2.4.  Shares Held by First Texas or Simmons.

  



  

Each Canceled Share shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or delivered in
exchange therefor.

  



  

2.5.  Fractional Shares.

  



  

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Simmons Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Simmons
shall relate to such fractional share interests, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
shareholder of Simmons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of First Texas Common Stock exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Simmons Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Simmons Common Stock that
such holder of shares of First Texas Common Stock would otherwise have been
entitled multiplied by the Per Share Cash Equivalent Consideration. No such
holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other rights as a
shareholder in respect of any fractional shares.

no further registration of transfers of shares of First Texas Common Stock.
From and after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares of First Texas
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have

Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore
representing shares of First Texas Common Stock (other than the
Canceled Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in
exchange therefor, subject, however, to the Simmons' obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time which have been declared or made by First Texas in respect of
such shares of First Texas Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares (if any) pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or distributions

of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the
whole shares of Simmons Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and other
documentation required by the Surviving Corporation hereunder in lieu thereof)
there shall be paid to the record holder of the whole shares of Simmons
Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such whole shares
of Simmons Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Simmons Common Stock.

  



  

(e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the former Holders on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Simmons, and any
former Holders who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration
(including any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any applicable dividends
or other distributions with respect to Simmons Common Stock) to which
they are entitled under this ARTICLE 3 shall thereafter look only to Simmons
and the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims with respect
thereto.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Regulatory Authority), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Simmons, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto or their successors, assigns,
or personal representatives. None of Simmons, First Texas, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent
or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Holder in respect of any
cash that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g)   _Withholding Rights_. Each and any of Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts or
property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution under the
Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Regulatory Authority by
Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  



   

11

 



    

  

(h)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE 3.

  



  

(i)   _Change in Name on Certificate_. If any Simmons
Certificate representing shares of Simmons Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a Simmons Certificate representing shares of Simmons Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

shares of First Texas Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC
(the " _First Texas Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall not be converted into

such Holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such First Texas
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections 10.351
through 10.368 of the TBOC. At the Effective Time, all First Texas Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Sections
10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such Holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC, then the right of such Holder to
be paid the fair value of such Holder's First Texas Dissenting Shares under
Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC shall cease and such First Texas
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares (if any) pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends
or distributions (if any) pursuant to Section 3.1(d).

(b)  First Texas shall give Simmons prompt written notice (but
in any event within 48 hours) to Simmons of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of First Texas Common Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and
Simmons shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. First Texas shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Simmons, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
payment.

  



  

(c)  Holders of Simmons Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Simmons Common Stock (the "
_Simmons Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Subchapter 13 of the ABCA (" _Subchapter 13_ ") (the
" _Simmons Dissenting Shareholders_ "), shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Simmons Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Subchapter 13. At the Effective Time, all Simmons Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Simmons Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the fair value of such Simmons Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Subchapter 13. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Subchapter 13, or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Subchapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Simmons Dissenting Shares under Subchapter 13 shall
cease and such Simmons Dissenting Shares shall revert to shares of Simmons
Common Stock.

(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of First Texas or any First Texas Subsidiary or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that First Texas or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in

or any of its officers, directors or employees to the board of directors of
First Texas or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of First

thereof) in connection with any Contractor nor has First Texas performed any
act or engaged in any activity that could result in First Texas being found
to be a joint employer of a Contractor under the National Labor Relations
Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, any Occupational Safety and Health
Administration laws or regulations, any state worker's compensation laws, or
any other law or regulation. The First Texas Entities have properly
classified, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and any other applicable
Law, all Contractors used by the First Texas Entities at any point.

  



   

26

 



    

  

(e)  The First Texas Entities have no "leased employees" within
the meaning of Internal Revenue Code § 414(n).

  



  

(f)  The First Texas Entities have, or will have no later than
the Closing Date, accrued all salaries, bonuses, commissions, and other wages
due to be paid through the Closing Date. Each of the First Texas Entities is
and at all times has been in material compliance with all Laws governing the
employment of labor and the withholding of taxes, including but not limited
to, all contractual commitments and all such Laws relating to wages, hours,
affirmative action, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, safety and health, workers' compensation and the collection and
payment of withholding and/or Social Security taxes and similar taxes.

  



  

(g)  There have not been any wage and hour claims by any
employee of any First Texas Entity since December 31, 2012, nor, to First
Texas' Knowledge, are there any wage and hour claims currently threatened by
any employee of any First Texas Entity. Except for claims for benefits in the
Ordinary Course under a First Texas Benefit Plan, there have not been any
proceedings by any employee of any First Texas Entity related to their
employment with such First Texas Entity since December 31, 2012, nor, to the
Knowledge of First Texas, are there any proceedings currently threatened by
any employee of any First Texas Entity related to their employment with such
First Texas Entity. To the Knowledge of First Texas, there are no governmental
investigations open with or under consideration by the Department of Labor,
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs or any other governmental body charged with administering
or enforcing employment related laws or regulations.

  



  

(h)  All of the First Texas Entities' employees are employed in
the United States and are either United States citizens or are legally
entitled to work in the United States under the Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, as amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws
related to the employment of non-United States citizens applicable in the
state in which the employees are employed. Each individual who renders
services to any First Texas Entity has provided proof of employment
eligibility and is properly classified as having the status of an employee or
independent contractor or other non-employee status (including for purposes
of taxation and Tax reporting and under First Texas Benefit Plans).

  



  

4.19.  Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a)  First Texas has made available to Simmons prior to the
execution of this Agreement, true and correct copies of each Employee Benefit
Plan currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or
contributed to by any First Texas Entity or ERISA Affiliate thereof for the
benefit of employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent
contractors, or other beneficiaries or under which employees, retirees,
former employees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors,
or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate or with respect to which
First Texas or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or
Liability (collectively, the " _First Texas Benefit Plans_ "). Any of the
First Texas Benefit Plans which is an "employee pension benefit plan," as
that term is defined in ERISA Section 3(2), is referred to herein as a "
_First Texas ERISA Plan_." Section 4.19(a) of First Texas' Disclosure
Memorandum has a complete and accurate list of all First Texas Benefit Plans.
No First Texas Benefit Plan is subject to any Laws other than those of the
United States or any state, county, or municipality in the United States.
First Texas has made available to Simmons prior to the execution of this
Agreement (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements for all First
Texas Benefit Plans, (ii) all determination letters, opinion letters,
information letters or advisory opinions issued by the United States Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), the United States Department of Labor (" _DOL_
") or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") regarding a First
Texas Benefit Plan during this calendar year or any of the preceding three
calendar years, or the most recent such letter or opinion if issued prior to
the preceding three calendar years, (iii) annual reports or returns, audited
or unaudited financial statements, actuarial or allocation reports, non-
discrimination tests and valuations prepared for any First Texas Benefit Plan
for the current plan year and the preceding three plan years, (iv) the most
recent summary plan descriptions and any material modifications thereto for
any First Texas Benefit Plan, (v) any correspondence with the DOL, IRS, PBGC,
or any other governmental entity regarding a First Texas Benefit Plan since
December 31, 2009, (vi) any correspondence, memorandum or calculations
regarding errors since December 31, 2009 corrected or to be corrected with
respect to any First Texas Benefit Plan under the IRS Employee Plans
Compliance Resolution System and (vii) all actuarial valuations of First Texas
Benefit Plans since December 31, 2009.

  



   

27

 



    

  

(b)  Each First Texas Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in
material compliance with the terms of such First Texas Benefit Plan, and in
material compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue
Code, ERISA, and any other applicable Laws. No First Texas Benefit Plan is
required to be amended within the ninety-day period beginning on the Closing
Date in order to continue to comply with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code,
and other applicable Law. Each First Texas Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified
and has received a favorable determination letter, or for a prototype or
volume submitter plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect
and applies to the First Texas Benefit Plan and on which such First Texas
Benefit Plan is entitled to rely. Nothing has occurred and no circumstance
exists that could adversely affect the qualified status of such First Texas
Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c)  There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of First Texas,
threatened claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, the
First Texas Benefit Plans other than claims for benefits in the Ordinary
Course and no action, proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing or
investigation has been commenced with respect to any First Texas Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d)  Neither First Texas nor any Affiliate of First Texas has
engaged in any prohibited transaction for which there is not an exemption,
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, with
respect to any First Texas Benefit Plan and no prohibited transaction has
occurred with respect to any First Texas Benefit Plan that would be reasonably
expected to result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code. Neither First Texas, any First Texas Entity, any First Texas
Entity employee, nor any committee of which any First Texas Entity employee is
a member has materially breached his or her fiduciary duty with respect to a
First Texas Benefit Plan in connection with any acts taken (or failed to be
taken) with respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any
First Texas Benefit Plan. To First Texas' Knowledge, no fiduciary, within the
meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA, who is not First Texas or any First Texas
Entity employee, has breached his or her fiduciary duty with respect to a
First Texas Benefit Plan or otherwise has any liability in connection with any
acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or
investment of the assets of any First Texas Benefit Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA
or the Internal Revenue Code being imposed on First Texas or any Affiliate of
First Texas.

  



   

28

 



    

  

(e)  Neither First Texas nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any
time been a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been
obligated to contribute to, or had any liability with respect to (i) any plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, including a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
ERISA Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)), (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code), (iii) a self-funded health
or welfare benefit plan, (iv) any voluntary employees' beneficiary
association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code), or (v) an arrangement that is not either exempt from, or in compliance
with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or that provides for
indemnification for or gross-up of any taxes thereunder.

  



  

(f)  Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare
plan has been amended and administered in accordance with the requirements of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.

  



  

(g)  No First Texas Entity has any Liability or obligation to
provide postretirement health, medical or life insurance benefits to any
First Texas Entity's employees or former employees, officers, or directors, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise required under
state or federal benefits continuation Laws and for which the covered
individual pays the full cost of coverage. No Tax under Internal Revenue Code
Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any First Texas
Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

  



  

(h)  All contributions required to be made to any First Texas
Benefit Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any First Texas Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of First Texas.

  



  

(i)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any First Texas Entity, or result in any (a) requirement
to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi
trust) or (b) limitation on the right of any First Texas Entity to amend,
merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any First
Texas Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) by the First Texas Entities in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a
result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code. Section 4.19(i) of First Texas' Disclosure Memorandum sets
forth accurate and complete data with respect to each individual who has a
contractual right to severance pay or benefits triggered by a change in
control and the amounts potentially payable to each such individual in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a termination of
employment or service, taking into account any contractual provisions
relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No First Texas Benefit
Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999
or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

  



  

4.20.  Material Contracts.

  



  

None of the First Texas Entities, nor any of their respective Assets,
businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or
receives benefits under, any Contract (whether written or oral), (a) that is
either material to any First Texas Entity or that would be required to be
filed as an exhibit to a

Course) in excess of $10,000, (d) which prohibits or restricts any First Texas

this Agreement, Simmons) from engaging in any business activities in any
geographic area, line of business or otherwise in competition with any other
Person, (e) relating to the purchase or sale of any goods or services by a
First Texas Entity (other than Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course
and involving payments under any individual Contract not in excess of $50,000
over its remaining term or involving Loans, borrowings or guarantees
originated or purchased by any First Texas Entity in the Ordinary Course),
(f) which obligates any First Texas Entity to conduct business with any third
party on an exclusive or preferential basis or requires referrals of business
or any First Texas Entity to make available investment opportunities to any
Person on a priority or exclusive basis, (g) which limits the payment of
dividends by any First Texas Entity, (h) pursuant to which any First Texas
Entity has agreed with any third parties to become a member of, manage or

(including indemnification, "earn-out" or other contingent obligations) that
are still in effect, (j) which relates to Intellectual Property of First
Texas (except generally commercially available "off the shelf" software
programs licensed pursuant to "shrink wrap" or "click and accept" licenses),
(k) between any First Texas Entity, on the one hand, and (i) any officer or
director of any First Texas Entity, or (ii) to the Knowledge of First
Texas, any (x) record or beneficial owner of five percent or more of the
voting securities of First Texas, (y) Affiliate or family member of any such
officer, director or record or beneficial owner or (z) any other Affiliate of
First Texas, on the other hand, except those of a type available to employees
of First Texas generally, (l) that provides for payments to be made by First
Texas or any of its Subsidiaries upon a change in control thereof, (m) that
may not be canceled by Simmons, First Texas or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (i) at their convenience (subject to no more than 90
days' prior written notice), or (ii) without payment of a penalty or
termination fee equal to or greater than $75,000 (assuming such Contract was
terminated on the Closing Date), (n) containing any standstill or similar
agreement pursuant to which First Texas has agreed not to acquire Assets or
equity interests of another Person, (o) that provides for indemnification by
First Texas or any of its Subsidiaries of any Person, except for non-
material Contracts entered into in the Ordinary Course, (p) with or to a

contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional acts or events), or (s) any other Contract or amendment thereto
that is material to any First Texas Entity or their respective business or
Assets and not otherwise entered into in the Ordinary Course. Each
Contract of the type described in this Section 4.20, whether or not set forth
in First Texas' Disclosure Memorandum together with all Contracts referred to
in Sections 4.13 and 4.19(a), are referred to herein as the " _First Texas
Contracts_." With respect to each First Texas Contract: (i) the First Texas
Contract is legal, valid and binding on First Texas or a First Texas
Subsidiary and is in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance
with its terms; (ii) no First Texas Entity is in material Default thereunder;
(iii) no First Texas Entity has repudiated or waived any material provision of
any such First Texas Contract; (iv) no other party to any such First Texas
Contract is, to the Knowledge of First Texas, in material Default or has

First Texas Contracts have been Previously Disclosed and complete and correct

of the indebtedness of any First Texas Entity for money borrowed is prepayable
at any time by such First Texas Entity without penalty or premium.

Texas Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has First Texas or any First Texas
Subsidiary been advised in writing or, to First Texas' Knowledge, orally,

issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such First Texas Regulatory
Agreement.

  



  

4.22.  Investment Securities.

  



  

(a)  Each of First Texas and its Subsidiaries has good title in
all material respects to all securities and commodities owned by it (except
those sold under repurchase agreements, borrowings of federal funds or
advances and loans from the Federal Reserve Banks or Federal Home Loan Banks
or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any Lien,
except to the extent such securities or commodities are pledged in the
Ordinary Course and in accordance with prudent banking practices to secure
obligations of First Texas or its Subsidiaries. Such securities are valued on

from a financial point of view, to such holders. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

4.28.  Tax and Regulatory Matters.

  



  

No First Texas Entity or, to the Knowledge of First Texas, any Affiliate
thereof has taken or agreed to take any action, and First Texas does not
have any Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is
reasonably likely to (a) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code or (b) materially impede or delay receipt of any of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

4.29.  Loan Matters.

  



  

(a)  Neither First Texas nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to any written or oral Loan in which First Texas or any First Texas
Subsidiary is a creditor which as of December 31, 2016, had an outstanding
balance of $50,000 or more and under the terms of which the obligor was, as
of December 31, 2016, over 90 days or more delinquent in payment of principal
or interest. Except as such disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law,
Section 4.29(a) of First Texas' Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of (i) all of the Loans of First Texas and its
Subsidiaries that, (A) as of December 31, 2016 had an outstanding balance of
$50,000 or more and were (1) on non-accrual status or (2) classified by First
Texas as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard,"
"Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets,"
"Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar import, together with the
principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the
aggregate principal amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as
of such date, or (B) with respect to which, at any point since December 31,
2012, constituted a "Troubled Debt Restructuring," as defined in the
Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 310-40.

  



  

(b)  Each Loan _currently outstanding_ (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium, or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding may be brought). The notes or other
credit or security documents with respect to each such outstanding Loan were
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws at the time of
origination or purchase by a First Texas Entity and are complete and correct
in all material respects.

  



   

33

 



    

  

(c)  Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to
investors) was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant
notes or other credit or security documents, First Texas' written underwriting
standards (and, in the case of Loans held for resale to investors, the
underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and with all
applicable requirements of Laws.

  



  

(d)  None of the Contracts pursuant to which any First Texas
Entity has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools
of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein
solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.
Except as would not be material to First Texas and its Subsidiaries, each Loan
included in a pool of Loans originated, securitized or, to the Knowledge of
First Texas, acquired by First Texas or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Pool_
") meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable requirements
for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and Loan guaranty certificates)
for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have been finally certified or, if
required, recertified in accordance with all applicable Laws, rules and
regulations, except where the time for certification or recertification has
not yet expired. No Pools have been improperly certified, and, except as
would not be material to First Texas and its Subsidiaries, no Loan has been
bought out of a Pool without all required approvals of the applicable
investors.

  



  

(e)  (i) _Section 4.29(e)_ of First Texas' Disclosure
Memorandum sets forth a list of all Loans as of the date hereof by First
Texas to any directors, executive officers and principal shareholders (as such
terms are defined in Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board (12 C.F.R.
Part 215)) of any First Texas Entity, (ii) there are no employee, officer,
director, principal shareholder or other affiliate Loans on which the
borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or other
relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower is paying a
rate which was not in compliance with Regulation O and (iii) all such Loans
are and were originated in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.

  



  

(f)  Neither First Texas nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor
has it ever been since December 31, 2012, subject to any material fine,
suspension, settlement or other contract or other administrative agreement or
sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any
Regulatory Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage
or consumer Loans.

All of the deposits held by Southwest Bank (including the records and
documentation pertaining to such deposits) have been established and are
held in compliance in all material respects with (a) all applicable policies,
practices and procedures of Southwest Bank and (b) all applicable Laws,
including Money Laundering Laws and anti-terrorism or embargoed persons
requirements. All of the deposits held by Southwest Bank are insured to the

ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

7.1.  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement; Shareholder
Approvals.

  



  

(a)  Except as Previously Disclosed, Simmons and First Texas
shall prepare and file with the SEC, a joint proxy statement/prospectus in
definitive form (including any amendments thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ")
and Simmons shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement
(including the prospectus of Simmons and Proxy Statement constituting a part
thereof and all related documents), subject to full cooperation of both
Parties and their respective advisors and accountants. Simmons and First
Texas agree to cooperate, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with the other Party and its counsel and its accountants in the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Each of
Simmons and First Texas agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof, and First
Texas and Simmons shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to
their respective shareholders promptly following the date of effectiveness of
the Registration Statement. Simmons also agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and First Texas shall furnish all information concerning
First Texas and the holders of First Texas Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each of Simmons and First Texas
agrees to furnish to the other Party all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Simmons,
First Texas or their respective Subsidiaries to any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. First Texas shall have the right to review and consult with Simmons
with respect to any information included in, the Registration Statement prior
to its being filed with the SEC. Simmons will advise First Texas, promptly
after Simmons receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration
Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of
Simmons Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the
initiation or written threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of
any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration
Statement or for additional information.

  



   

46

 



    

  

(b)  First Texas shall duly call, give notice of, establish a
record date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (" _First Texas '
Shareholders' Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the
purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement by a majority of the
outstanding shares of First Texas Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the "
_First Texas Shareholder Approval_ ") and such other related matters as it
deems appropriate. First Texas agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, proposal,
disclosure or communication to First Texas of any Acquisition Proposal.
First Texas shall (i) through its board of directors (which shall recommend
and determine advisable the Merger and this Agreement), recommend to its
shareholders the adoption of this Agreement (the " _First Texas
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such First Texas Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the First Texas
Shareholder Approval. Except as set forth in this Section 7.1(b), neither the
board of directors of First Texas nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Simmons, the First Texas Recommendation or
take any action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent
with the First Texas Recommendation (any of the foregoing being a " _Change
in the First Texas Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, at any time prior to the First Texas' Shareholders' Meeting, if
First Texas has received a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the
terms of any revised offer by Simmons pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)),
the board of directors of First Texas may, in connection with the Superior
Proposal, make a Change in the First Texas Recommendation, if the board of
directors of First Texas has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, that the board of directors of First Texas may not take the actions
set forth in this Section 7.1(b) unless:

  



  

(i) First Texas has complied in all material respects with this Section 7.1;

  



  

(ii) First Texas has provided prior written notice to Simmons at least four
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Simmons that the board of directors of First Texas
has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of such Superior
Proposal;

  



  

(iii) during the Notice Period, First Texas has and has caused its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Simmons in good faith
(to the extent Simmons desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the board of directors of First
Texas) a Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(iv) the board of directors of First Texas has determined in good faith,
after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Simmons, if any,
that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal.

  



  

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
First Texas shall deliver a new written notice to Simmons and shall comply
with the requirements of this Section 7.1 with respect to such new written
notice, including commencement of a new Notice Period. Notwithstanding any
Change in the First Texas Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the shareholders of First Texas at the First Texas' Shareholders' Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve First Texas of such obligation; provided,
that if the board of directors of First Texas shall have effected a Change in
the First Texas Recommendation, then the board of directors of First Texas, in
connection with the submission of this Agreement to the shareholders of First
Texas may submit this Agreement without recommendation (although the
resolution adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded), in which event the board of directors of First Texas may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders of
First Texas in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto. In addition to the foregoing, First Texas shall not submit to the
vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. If
requested by Simmons, at Simmons' expense, First Texas shall retain a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to, and on terms reasonably acceptable to,
Simmons in connection with obtaining the First Texas Shareholder Approval.

  



   

47

 



    

  

(c)  First Texas shall adjourn or postpone First Texas'
Shareholders' Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is
originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of First Texas Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of such meeting. First Texas shall also adjourn or
postpone First Texas' Shareholders' Meeting, if on the date of First Texas'
Shareholders' Meeting First Texas has not recorded proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the First Texas Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, First Texas'
Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted
to the shareholders of First Texas at First Texas' Shareholders' Meeting, for
the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters
contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
First Texas of such obligation. First Texas shall only be required to adjourn
or postpone First Texas' Shareholders' Meeting three times pursuant to the
second sentence of this Section 7.1(c).

  



  

(d)  Simmons shall duly call, give notice of, establish a record
date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (the " _Simmons '
Shareholders' Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the
purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement by a majority of
the outstanding shares of Simmons Common Stock entitlved to vote thereon (the
" _Simmons Shareholder Approval_ ") and such other related matters as it
deems appropriate. Simmons shall (i) through its board of directors, recommend
to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement (the " _Simmons
Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such Simmons Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Simmons
Shareholder Approval.

  



  

7.2.  Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE 9, each First
Texas Entity shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, take any action to solicit, encourage (including
by providing information or assistance), initiate, facilitate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide or make available any
information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than a
Simmons Entity and their Representatives) concerning any Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal. Each First Texas Entity shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any Person (other than the Simmons Entities and their
Representatives) that has made or indicated an intention to make an
Acquisition Proposal. If any First Texas Entity or their respective
Representatives receives any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, First
Texas shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than two
Business Days) notify Simmons in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), and First
Texas shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than
two Business Days) provide to Simmons (a) a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, if in writing, or (b) a written summary of the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral.
First Texas shall provide Simmons as promptly as practicable (but in no event
more than two Business Days) with notice setting forth all such information as
is necessary to keep Simmons informed on a current basis in all material
respects of all communications regarding (including material amendments or
proposed material amendments to) such Acquisition Proposal request or inquiry.

  



   

48

 



    

  

7.3.  Exchange Listing.

  



  

Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on NASDAQ the shares of Simmons Common Stock to be issued to
the holders of First Texas Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Simmons
shall give all notices and make all filings with NASDAQ required in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

7.4.  Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

(a)  Simmons and First Texas and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare
all documentation, to effect all applications, notices and filings and to
obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Regulatory Authorities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and
Regulatory Authorities. Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger
under any applicable Law or Order; provided, that in no event shall Simmons
be required to accept any new restriction or condition on any of the Simmons
Entities or the First Texas Entities which is materially burdensome on
Simmons' business or on the business of First Texas or Southwest Bank, in
each case following the Closing or which would likely reduce the economic
benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Simmons to
such a degree that Simmons would not have entered into this Agreement had such
condition or restriction been known to it at the date hereof (any such
condition or restriction, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Each of Simmons and
First Texas shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing review and consultation rights, each of the
Parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
Party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other Party hereto with
respect to the obtaining of all material Permits and Consents of third
parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the
other Party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the
other Party upon receiving any communication from a Regulatory Authority the
Consent of which is required for the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such Party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or approval
from a Regulatory Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such
consent or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory Communication_
"). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the scope
of the foregoing paragraphs, the receiving Party shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law (i) promptly advise the other Party of the receipt
of such Regulatory Communication, (ii) provide the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any
response thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission or
communication prior to the filing or submission thereof (other than portions
of materials to be filed or submitted in connection therewith that contain
confidential or non-public supervisory information or competitively sensitive
business or proprietary information), and (iii) if permitted by the
applicable Regulatory Authority, provide the other Party with the opportunity
to participate in any meetings or substantive telephone conversations that
the receiving party or its Representatives may have from time to time with any
Regulatory Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent such meetings or telephone conversations do not
contain or involve confidential or non-public supervisory information,
competitively sensitive business or proprietary information.

  



   

49

 



    

  

(b)  Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable Laws
related to the exchange of information, to promptly furnish the other Party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Regulatory
Authority.

  



  

7.5.  Investigation and Confidentiality.

  



  

(a)  First Texas shall promptly notify Simmons of any material
change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of its
properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of a material claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
involving First Texas or Southwest Bank.

  



  

(b)  First Texas shall promptly advise Simmons of any fact,
change, event or circumstance known to First Texas (i) that has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on First Texas or (ii)
which First Texas believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of
this Section 7.5(b) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2
to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach
would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 to be satisfied.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, First Texas shall permit
Simmons to make or cause to be made such investigation of the business and
properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective financial and
legal conditions as Simmons reasonably requests, provided that such
investigation shall not interfere unnecessarily with normal operations. No
investigation by Simmons shall affect the ability of Simmons to rely on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of First Texas. Neither
Simmons nor First Texas nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Simmons' or First Texas',
as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty
or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



   

50

 



    

  

(d)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its advisers and agents
to, maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to
it by the other Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses,
operations, and financial positions and shall not use such information for
any purpose except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and
copies thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information
received from the other Party.

  



  

7.6.  Press Releases.

  



  

First Texas and Simmons agree that no press release or other public
disclosure or communication (including communications to employees, agents and
contractors of First Texas) related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by either Party (or its
Affiliates) without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to
prohibit any Party from making any press release or other public disclosure
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United
States securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the
release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other
Party reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of
the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press
release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

7.7.  Tax Treatment.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action
which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes. The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
in order to obtain the Tax Opinions. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

  



  

(b)  Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of
Simmons and First Texas shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take
any inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  



  

7.8.  Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  



  

(a)  Except as contemplated by this Agreement, from and after
the Effective Time and while employed by Simmons, Simmons shall provide to
the officers and employees actively employed by a First Texas Entity on the
Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") employee benefits under Simmons'
Employee Benefit Plans that are offered to similarly situated employees of
Simmons, including, severance benefits in accordance with the applicable
severance policy of Simmons (other than to any Covered Employee who is party
to an individual agreement or letter that entitles such person to different
severance or termination benefits than those provided under Simmons'
severance policy); provided, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be
eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of any Simmons Entity.
Until such time as the Covered Employees commence participation in the
applicable Employee Benefit Plans of Simmons, the Covered Employees'
continued participation in a comparable First Texas Benefit Plan shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.8 (it being
understood that participation in Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans may commence
at different times with respect to each of Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans).
For purposes of determining a Covered Employee's eligibility to participate
in, and vesting under, Simmons' Employee Benefit Plans, and for purposes of
determining a Covered Employee's entitlement to paid time off under Simmons'
paid time off program, each Covered Employee's service with a First Texas
Entity prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service by
such Covered Employee with a Simmons Entity, to the same extent that such
service was recognized by the First Texas Entities for purposes of a similar
First Texas Benefit Plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not
(i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to
the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of Simmons Entities

(b)  If requested by Simmons in a writing delivered to First
Texas following the date hereof and at least ten (10) days prior to the

shall the terms of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any First
Texas Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Simmons, First Texas or any of their respective
Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Simmons or any Simmons
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the First Texas Entities) to

officer, director or consultant, any right to employment or continued
employment or continued service with Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, the First Texas Entities), or

reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  



   

52

 



    

  

7.9.  Indemnification.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Simmons shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors or officers of the First Texas Entities (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions arising out of the Indemnified Party's service or services as
directors or officers of First Texas or, at First Texas' request, of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted under state
Law and by First Texas' certificate of formation and bylaws as in effect on
the date hereof, including provisions relating to advances of expenses
incurred in the defense of any Litigation and whether or not any Simmons
Entity is insured against any such matter. Without limiting the foregoing, in
any case in which approval by Simmons is required to effectuate any
indemnification, Simmons shall direct, at the election of the Indemnified
Party, that the determination of any such approval shall be made by
independent counsel mutually agreed upon between Simmons and the Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(b)  Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts (and First
Texas shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to
maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time First
Texas' existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided
that Simmons may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous or (ii) with the consent of First Texas
given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time and
covering persons who are currently covered by such insurance; provided, that
Simmons shall not be obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such
six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy)
which exceed, for the portion related to First Texas' directors and officers,
200% of the annual premium payments currently paid on First Texas' current
policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ").
If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In
lieu of the foregoing, Simmons, or First Texas in consultation with Simmons,
may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a
premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the premium necessary to
purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons may
purchase the most advantageous "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for a premium
equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each case, Simmons shall have no further
obligations under this Section 7.9(b) other than to maintain such
"tail" prepaid policy.

  



  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Liability or
Litigation, shall promptly notify Simmons thereof. In the event of any such
Litigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Simmons
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Simmons shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if Simmons elects not to
assume such defense or independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest
between Simmons and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Simmons shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; provided, that Simmons shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties unless if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to
Simmons, (x) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the other Indemnified
Parties or (y) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Parties that cannot be waived, Simmons shall be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party; (ii) the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such Litigation; and
(iii) Simmons shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent; and provided, further, that Simmons shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



   

53

 



    

  

(d)  If Simmons or any successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or if Simmons (or any
successors or assigns) shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets
to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Simmons shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 7.9.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and Representatives.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9 to the
contrary, no indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party
with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any
federal banking agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i)
the Simmons' board of directors reasonably determines in writing after
consultation with legal counsel that the Indemnified Party acted in good
faith and in the best interests of the First Texas or Southwest Bank; (ii) the
Simmons' board of directors determines that the payment will not materially
affect the Simmons' safety and soundness; (iii) the payment does not fall
within the definition of a prohibited indemnification payment under 12 C.F.R.
Part 359; and (iv) the Indemnified Party agrees in writing to reimburse the
Simmons, to the extent not covered by permissible insurance, for payments made
in the event that the administrative or civil action instituted by a banking
Regulatory Authority results in a final order or settlement in which the
Indemnified Party is assessed a civil money penalty, is prohibited from
banking, or is required to cease an action or perform an affirmative action.

  



  

7.10.  Operating Functions.

  



  

First Texas and Southwest Bank shall cooperate with Simmons and Simmons Bank
in connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the Parties and the operation of Simmons Bank and Southwest Bank, and in
preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be
effective at the Effective Time or such later date as Simmons may decide.
First Texas shall take any action Simmons may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the combination of the operations of First Texas
with Simmons. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such
service providers and/or the other party). Without limiting the foregoing,
First Texas shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the foregoing,
and senior officers of First Texas and Simmons shall meet from time to time
as First Texas or Simmons may reasonably request to review the financial and
operational affairs of First Texas and Southwest Bank, and First Texas shall
give due consideration to Simmons' input on such matters, with
the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, (a) neither Simmons nor Simmons Bank shall under any circumstance
be permitted to exercise control of First Texas, Southwest Bank or any other
First Texas Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (b) neither First Texas
nor any Southwest Bank shall be under any obligation to act in a manner that
could reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under
federal or state antitrust Laws, and (c) neither First Texas nor Southwest
Bank shall be required to agree to any material obligation that is not
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

  



   

54

 



    

  

7.11.  Shareholder Litigation.

  



  

Each of Simmons and First Texas shall promptly notify each other in writing
of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation, suit,
subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator
pending or, to the Knowledge of Simmons or First Texas, as applicable,
threatened against Simmons, First Texas or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question
the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or
thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Simmons, First Texas or their
respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to
enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
First Texas shall give Simmons every opportunity to participate in the defense
or settlement of any shareholder litigation against First Texas and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Simmons' prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

7.12.  Legal Conditions to Merger.

  



  

Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Simmons and First
Texas shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other Party to obtain) any Consent or Order by, any Regulatory Authority and
any other third party that is required to be obtained by First Texas or
Simmons or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with, or to
effect, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any
merger between a Subsidiary of Simmons, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of First Texas, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the Parties to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Simmons.

  



  

7.13.  Change of Method.

  



  

Simmons may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger (including
by providing for the merger of First Texas with a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Simmons) if and to the extent requested by Simmons, and First Texas agrees to
enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Simmons may reasonably
request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such
change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the
Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the
Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to First Texas' shareholders or
(iii) be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be materially delayed or
the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or
materially delayed.

  



  

7.14.  Takeover Laws.

  



  

Neither Simmons nor First Texas shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Simmons and First
Texas shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law
may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Simmons and First Texas will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any
such Takeover Law.

Effective Time and First Texas' consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, and shareholders' equity for the period from January 1, 2016 through
the close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the

of First Texas in all material respects. Such financial statements shall have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles and
other applicable legal and accounting requirements, and reflect all period-
end accruals and other adjustments. Such Closing Financial Statements shall
also reflect as of their date (a) accruals for all fees, costs, and expenses
incurred or expected to be incurred (whether or not doing so is in accordance
with GAAP) in connection (directly or indirectly) with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the capital ratios set forth in Section
8.2(g) (provided that such ratios shall be computed excluding fees, costs, and
expenses incurred directly in connection with the transactions contemplated

The representations and warranties set forth in each other section in ARTICLE
4 shall, in the aggregate, be true and correct in all respects except where
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, that, for purposes of this sentence
only, those representations and warranties which are qualified by references
to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or to the "Knowledge" of any
Person shall be deemed not to include such qualifications.

Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural,
and any plural term the singular. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed followed by the
words "without limitation." The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any specific Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the
masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may
require. If a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of
such word or phrase have a corresponding meaning. Any capitalized terms used
in any schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the
meaning set forth in this Agreement. All references to "dollars" or "$" in
this Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement" (or similar phrases) include the
transactions provided for in this Agreement, including the Merger. Any
Contract or Law defined or referred to herein or in any Contract that is
referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Law) by succession of comparable successor Law
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. The term "made available" means any document or other information
that was (a) provided (whether by physical or electronic delivery) by one
Party or its representatives to the other Party and its representatives at
least two Business Days prior to the date hereof, (b) included in the virtual

10.3.  Expenses.

  



  

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3 and
Section 7.1(b), each of the Parties shall bear and pay all direct costs and
expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including filing, registration and application fees,
printing and mailing fees, and fees and expenses of its own financial or other
consultants, investment bankers, accountants, and counsel.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if:

  



  

(i)  (A) (1) First Texas terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) prior to ten (10) Business Days after the date the
requirements of Section 8.1(b) are satisfied, (2) either First Texas or
Simmons terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii), or (3)
Simmons terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g); and (B) within
12 months of such termination First Texas shall either consummate an
Acquisition Transaction (provided that, for purposes of this Section
10.3(b)(i), each reference to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of
Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%") or enter
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Transaction,
whether or not such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated; or

  



  

(ii)  Simmons shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(d),

  



  

then First Texas shall pay to Simmons an amount equal to $18,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "). The payment of the Termination Fee by First Texas
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b) constitutes liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and shall be the sole monetary remedy of Simmons in the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c), 9.1(d)
or 9.1(g). If the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to subsection (i)
of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination Fee shall be paid in same-day funds
at or prior to the earlier of the date of consummation of such Acquisition
Transaction or the date of execution of an Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Acquisition Transaction. If the Termination Fee shall be payable
pursuant to subsection (ii) of this Section 10.3(b), the Termination Fee
shall be paid in same-day funds within two Business Days from the date of
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
paragraph (b) of this Section 10.3 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if First Texas fails to pay any
fee payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.3 when due, then First Texas
shall pay to Simmons its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in
connection with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of
the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was due
under this Agreement until the date of payment.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Memorandum of each of First Texas and Simmons, the exhibits, the
schedules, and the other documents and instruments referred to herein)
constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or
understandings with respect thereto, written or oral. Nothing in this
Agreement expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other
than the Parties or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than as provided in Section 7.9, which is intended for each Indemnified
Party. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the Parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the Parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof
to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any third party
beneficiary will be required to amend, modify to waive any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

10.5.  Amendments.

  



  

To the extent permitted by Law, this Agreement may be amended by a subsequent
writing signed by each of the Parties upon the approval of each of the
Parties, whether before or after First Texas Shareholder Approval of this
Agreement has been obtained; provided, that after obtaining First Texas
Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that requires further
approval by such First Texas Shareholders.

(a)  Prior to or at the Effective Time, Simmons, acting through
its board of directors, chief executive officer or other authorized officer,
shall have the right to waive any Default in the performance of any term of
this Agreement by First Texas, to waive or extend the time for the compliance
or fulfillment by First Texas of any and all of its obligations under this
Agreement, and to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Simmons under this Agreement, except any condition which,
if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law. No such waiver
shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized officer of
Simmons.

through its board of directors, chief executive officer or other authorized
officer, shall have the right to waive any Default in the performance of any
term of this Agreement by Simmons, to waive or extend the time for the
compliance or fulfillment by Simmons of any and all of its obligations under
this Agreement, and to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of First Texas under this Agreement, except any condition
which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law. No such
waiver shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized
officer of First Texas.

  



  

(c)  The failure of any Party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of
such Party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this
Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained
in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of
any other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

  



   

75

 



    

  

10.7.  Assignment.

  



  

Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

(a)  The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Arkansas without regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles
that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement
to the substantive Law of another jurisdiction (except that matters relating
to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of First Texas shall be
subject to the Laws of the State of Texas).

  



  

(b)  Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Arkansas (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims
arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action
or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the
Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any
party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 10.8.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.9.

  



  

10.10.  Counterparts; Signatures.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise
the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data
file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver
hereto or any agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each Party hereto forever waives any such defense.

  



   

77

 



    

  

10.11.  Captions; Articles and Sections.

  



  

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

  



  

10.12.  Interpretations.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party to this Agreement shall be considered the
draftsman. The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and
interpreted according to their ordinary meaning so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of all Parties hereto.

  



  

10.13.  Enforcement of Agreement.

  



  

The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money
damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach
of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled, without the requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

  



  

10.14.  Severability.

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

  



  

10.15.  Disclosure.

  



  

Any disclosure made in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
referred to or described in writing in any Section of this Agreement, in any
schedule or exhibit attached hereto or in any Disclosure Memorandum shall
apply only to, or only qualify, the indicated Section of this Agreement,
except to the extent that (a) any other Section of this Agreement specifically
referenced or cross-referenced in such disclosure or (b) the relevance of
such item to another Section of this Agreement is

  



    

78

 



    

reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that
such disclosure applies to such other Sections of this Agreement.
