Time: (A) an updated Capitalization Schedule; and (B) calculations of the
Members' Closing Consideration, the Optionholders' Closing Consideration and
the Warrantholders' Closing Consideration, and each Member's, Optionholder's
and Warrantholder's portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds,
Representative Holdback Amount and Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds,
which statement the Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on in
making payments pursuant to this Agreement, provided that neither the
Purchaser nor Merger Sub shall be responsible for the calculations or the
determinations regarding such calculations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement (the "Closing
Statement") setting forth the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, and including a schedule
indicating Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Working Capital and any
difference between such amount and the Closing Working Capital set forth on
the Working Capital Schedule. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Working Capital
shall be determined, (i) in accordance with the Working Capital Methodology,
and (ii) without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) The post‑Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in
this Section 3.03 is not intended to permit the introduction of different
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methods with respect to financial statements, their
classification or presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the
nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals) from those set
forth in the Working Capital Schedule and used in determining the amount of
the Target Working Capital; it being the intent of the parties hereto that the
Closing Working Capital be calculated consistently with the Target Working
Capital in order to allow a meaningful comparison of the Closing Working
Capital to the Target Working Capital. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent that the Closing Statement
corrects an error or an inconsistency, or noncompliance with the accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations,
definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation
methods with respect to financial statements, their classification or
presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts,
level of reserves or level of accruals) that are specified in the Company's
calculation of the Closing Working Capital or the Target Working Capital as
set forth on the Working Capital Schedule, then either the Closing Working
Capital, as set forth in the Closing Statement, or Target Working \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 22 -  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tCapital shall be reduced or increased as a result of such correction
of error, inconsistency or noncompliance, as appropriate, to reflect such
correction of error, inconsistency or noncompliance and (ii) if the same item
would be reflected differently in the Closing Statement than in the
calculations of the Target Working Capital set forth on the Working Capital
Schedule, the parties hereto will equitably adjust the calculation of either
the Closing Working Capital or Target Working Capital so as to result in
consistent treatment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Entity) shall (i) permit the Representative and its representatives to have
reasonable access to the books, records and other documents (including work
papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda, etc.) of the Surviving
Entity to the extent that they pertain to or were used in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the Purchaser's calculation of the
Closing Cash Proceeds and provide the Representative with copies thereof (as
reasonably requested by the Representative) and (ii) provide the
Representative and its representatives reasonable access to the Purchaser's
and its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Entity's) employees and
advisors (including making their chief financial officer(s) and accountants
available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the
Representative or its representatives); provided, in each case, that such
access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of the Purchaser or the Surviving Entity. If the
Representative disagrees with any part of the Purchaser's calculation of the
Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the Closing Statement, the
Representative shall, within sixty (60) days after the Representative's
receipt of the Closing Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth the Representative's calculation of the Closing
Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, and describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If
the Representative does not provide an Objection Notice within such sixty (60)
day period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full (on
behalf of all Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders) the Purchaser's
calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the Closing
Statement, which shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Purchaser and
the Representative (acting on behalf of all Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders) for all purposes hereunder. If an Objection Notice is
delivered to the Purchaser within such sixty (60) day period, then the
Purchaser and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
their disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash
Proceeds. In the event that the Purchaser and the Representative are unable
to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the
Purchaser's receipt of such Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the
Representative shall submit such remaining disagreements to a
nationally‑recognized valuation or consulting firm as is acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Representative (the "Valuation Firm"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding
determination with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in
dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this
Agreement. The Purchaser and the Representative shall cooperate with the
Valuation Firm during the term of its engagement and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, as soon as practicable, but in no
event later than forty-five (45) days following its engagement. The Valuation
Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the Purchaser's and the
Representative's respective \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 23 -  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tcalculations of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the
components thereof, that are identified as being items and amounts to which
the Purchaser and the Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving
any disputed item, the Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Valuation
Firm's determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the
components thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by
the Purchaser and the Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on
the definitions and methodologies included herein. The determination of the
Valuation Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Purchaser and the
Representative (acting on behalf of all Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders) and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining
the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be
borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on behalf of
the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders), on the other hand, based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if
the Purchaser claims the Closing Cash Proceeds are one thousand dollars
($1,000) less than the amount determined by the Representative, and the
Representative contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed
by the Purchaser, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Purchaser three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred
dollars ($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm
will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Representative
(on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders) and forty percent
(40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser. Prior to the Valuation Firm's
determination of Closing Cash Proceeds, (i) the Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Representative (on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders), on the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any
retainer paid to the Valuation Firm and (ii) during the engagement of the
Valuation Firm, the Valuation Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total
charges to each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Representative (on
behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders), on the other hand.
In connection with the Valuation Firm's determination of Closing Cash
Proceeds, the Valuation Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms of
the first and second sentences of this Section 3.03(g), and taking into
account all fees and expenses already paid by each of Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders), on the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the
allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and the
Representative (on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders),
which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Purchaser
and the Representative (acting on behalf of all Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Cash
Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 3.03: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 3.03 are less than the Estimated Closing Cash
Proceeds, then the Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow
Agent to: (A) pay to the Purchaser from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds an amount (which in no case shall exceed the amount of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds) (the \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 24 -  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t"Purchaser Adjustment Amount") equal to such deficiency, and (B) pay
to the Representative or to the Paying Agent at the Representative's direction
(on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders) the amount (if
any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds is
greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 3.03 are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds (the
amount of such deficiency, the "Seller Adjustment Amount"), then (A) the
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity or one or more of its
Subsidiaries to, pay to the Representative or the Paying Agent at the
Representative's direction (on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders) the Seller Adjustment Amount, and (B) the Purchaser and the
Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Representative or
the Paying Agent at the Representative's direction (on behalf of the Members,
Optionholders and Warrantholders) all of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts payable to
Representative (on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders) in
respect of this Section 3.03(h) shall be reduced by the respective amount owed
to LVP under the Lightspeed Purchase Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAll payments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.03(h) shall (x) be
treated by all parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Enterprise Value
and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Purchaser or the Representative, as applicable.
The payments described in Section 3.03(h)(i) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser for any and all claims arising under this Agreement
with respect to this Section 3.03. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tREPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser that the
statements in this Article V are true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in the schedules accompanying this Article V
(each, a "Schedule" and, collectively, the "Disclosure Schedules"). The
Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separate sections corresponding to the sections of this Article V; however,
information disclosed on one section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed on another section of the Disclosure Schedules or be
deemed to be an exception to another representation and warranty in this
Article V, in each case, if the relevance of such information to such other
section of the Disclosure Schedules or such other representation and warranty
is reasonably apparent on its face. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure
Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in
this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.01 Organization and Limited Liability Company Power. The
Company is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and the Company has all
requisite limited liability company power and authority to own and operate its
properties and to carry on its businesses as they have been and now are
conducted. The Company is qualified to do business and is in good standing
(or its equivalent) in every jurisdiction in which its ownership of property
or the conduct of business as now conducted requires it to qualify, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not constitute a Material Adverse
Change. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.02 Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on the Subsidiary
Schedule, the Company does not own or hold the right to acquire any Equity
Interest in any other Person. Except as set forth on the Subsidiary Schedule,
the Company owns, directly or indirectly, of record and beneficially, all
Equity Interests in each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens, Liens arising under applicable securities Laws
and Liens that will be terminated at or prior to the Closing), and all such
Equity Interests are validly issued, fully paid and non‑assessable (to \t\t

of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly formed or organized, validly existing
and in good standing (or its equivalent, if applicable) under the applicable
Laws of its jurisdiction of formation or organization, and each of the
Company's Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to own and
operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as they have been and
now are conducted. Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is qualified to do
business and is in good standing (or its equivalent) in every jurisdiction in
which its ownership of property or the conduct of business as now conducted
requires it to qualify, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
constitute a Material Adverse Change. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.03 Authorization; No Breach. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other agreement, document, instrument or
certificate contemplated by this Agreement to be executed by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company
Documents"), to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the Company Documents
by the Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all
requisite limited liability company action, and no other limited liability
company proceedings on its part are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been, and each of the
Company Documents will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and assuming that this
Agreement and each of the Company Documents is a valid and binding obligation
of the other parties hereto and thereto, this Agreement constitutes, and each
of the Company Documents when so executed and delivered will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its respective terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or to general principles of equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except for the requirements of the HSR Act, the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, and the requirements set forth on the Governmental Consents Schedule
and the Authorization Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each of the Company Documents by the Company and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or
compliance by the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of the provisions
hereof or thereof, do not and will not conflict with, result in any breach of,
require any consent or notice under, constitute a default under (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both), result in a violation of, result in
the creation of any Lien (other any Permitted Lien) upon any properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of a

Subsidiaries to make any payment under, any provision of (i) the Company's or
any of its Subsidiaries' certificates of formation, articles of incorporation,
limited liability company agreements, by‑laws or other organizational
documents, (ii) any Contract set forth on the Contracts Schedule to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (iii) any outstanding \t\t

Subsidiaries or any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any applicable Law to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.04 Equity Interests. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company's authorized and outstanding Equity Interests
are as set forth on the attached Capitalization Schedule. All of the
outstanding Equity Interests have been, or upon issuance will be, validly
issued and are fully paid and non‑assessable. Except as set forth on the
Capitalization Schedule, there are no outstanding options, warrants, scrip,
rights to subscribe to, purchase rights, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into, any Equity
Interests of the Company, or contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements, by which the Company is or may become bound to issue additional
Equity Interests. The Capitalization Schedule sets forth (i) the name of each
Person that is the registered holder of any Equity Interests and the number of
Equity Interests owned by such Person, and (ii) a list of all holders of
outstanding Options and Warrants, including the number of Equity Interests
subject to each such Option and Warrant and the extent to which such Option or
Warrant is vested and exercisable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Option was granted in compliance with all applicable
Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the stock option plan pursuant to
which it was issued. Each Option was granted with an exercise price per unit
equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying units on the
date of grant and has a grant date identical to the date on which the board of
managers of the Company or compensation committee actually awarded the Option.
Each Option and Warrant qualifies for the tax and accounting treatment
afforded to such Option or Warrant in the Company's Tax Returns and the
Company's financial statements, respectively, and does not trigger any

respect to the Trademarks included in the Company Registered Intellectual
Property, Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable and customary

 \t\t\t(f) Sufficiency. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or have
valid, legally enforceable right to use, license, practice and otherwise
exploit all Company Licensed Intellectual Property and all other Intellectual
Property used by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company Intellectual
Property constitutes all of the Intellectual Property used or currently
proposed to be used in connection with the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including with respect to all Company
Services. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) No In-Licenses for Learning Objects. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has licensed or received any other rights under
any Intellectual Property from any Person with respect to any Learning
Object(s) used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) No Indemnity. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless any
Person against any charge of infringement, misappropriation, violation or
similar claims with respect to any Intellectual Property. No customer or
other Person has requested that the Company or any Subsidiary defend or
indemnify the customer or such Person from a third party claim, suit or action
related to an allegation that a Company Service infringes, violates or
misappropriate a third party's Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) No Infringement by Other Persons. To the Company's
knowledge, no Company Owned Intellectual Property is being or has been
infringed, misappropriated or violated by any Person. Neither the Company nor

unsolicited offer to license or any cease and desist letter) or made any
assertions to any Person that such Person is infringing, misappropriating or
violating any Company Owned Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) No Infringement by the Company. The conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the using, offering,
selling, providing and licensing any Company Services, has not and does not
violate, infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise constitute unlawful use
of Intellectual Property of any Person. No Person has asserted or to the
Company's knowledge, threatened a claim, nor has the Company received any
written notification that the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
violates, infringes, misappropriates, or dilutes any Person's Intellectual
Property. No Person has sent to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries a
cease and desist letter related to the use of any Person's Intellectual
Property. No Person has notified the Company or any Company Subsidiary that
it requires a license to any Person's Intellectual Property. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any unsolicited written offer
to license (or any other notice of) any Person's Intellectual Property.
Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has conducted their business using
deceptive, misleading or unfair business or trade practices. \t\t

employees, consultants and independent contractors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries involved in, or who have contributed in any manner to, the
creation or development of any Company Owned Intellectual Property or Company
Services have executed and delivered to the Company a valid, binding,
enforceable written agreement regarding the protection of proprietary
information. Those current and former employees, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have created or
contributed to the development of material Company Owned Intellectual
Property, (i) are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries working in the
scope of their employments with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
therefore, the Intellectual Property created or developed by such employees is
owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries; or (ii) have executed and delivered
valid written agreements that include (A) an irrevocable, present assignment
to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries of all right, title and interest in
the Intellectual Property, or (B) an agreement that the Intellectual Property
is a work for hire pursuant the Copyright Act and therefore is owned by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries. Where any such assignment is not permitted
under applicable Law, the applicable employees and contractors have granted to
the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary an irrevocable, exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, transferrable and sublicensable licenses
or usage rights, each, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such non-
assignable Intellectual Property. Each such agreement is substantially
identical to the forms of invention assignment, employment, independent
contractor, consulting services and/or other written agreements, as
applicable, previously delivered by the Company to Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) No Government Funding. No funding, facilities, resources

educational institution, multi-national, bi-national or international
organization or research center was used in connection with the development or
creation, in whole or in part, any Company Owned Intellectual Property or
Company Services such that any such Governmental Body or any university,

ownership interest or title, contingent or otherwise, with respect to any
Company Owned Intellectual Property. \t\t

No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or
without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably be expected to,
result in the disclosure or delivery to any Person of any source code for any

or performance of this Agreement or any ancillary agreement contemplated
hereby, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
such ancillary agreements and the satisfaction of any set forth herein will
not contravene, conflict with or result in any termination of or new or
additional limitations on the Company's, any of its Subsidiaries' or

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.07 Assistance with Financing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to the limitations set forth below, and unless
otherwise agreed by the Purchaser, until the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, the Company will, at the
Purchaser's sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts, and
instruct its management to use commercially reasonable efforts, to provide
such reasonable and customary cooperation to the Purchaser as is reasonably
requested by the Purchaser or its Debt Financing Sources or as may be required
by any debt commitment letter in connection with the Purchaser\'s arrangement
of any debt financing in connection with this Agreement; provided that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company. Such cooperation
will include commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make appropriate senior
officers reasonably available, with appropriate advance notice, for assistance
in the preparation for and participation in a reasonable number of bank
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with parties acting as lead
arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchaser of, such debt
financing, and the members of management with appropriate seniority and
expertise, and other representatives of the Company), presentations, due
diligence sessions and sessions with prospective Debt Financing Sources and
investors, (ii) reasonably cooperate with the marketing efforts of the
Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources for all or any portion of such debt
financing, including providing reasonable assistance to Purchaser in
preparation of customary confidential information memoranda, bank syndication
materials and similar customary documents reasonably required in connection
with such debt financing and customary authorization letters (provided such
authorization letters shall not require the Company to make any
representations or statements with respect to any pro forma financial
statements or financial projections contained in such materials), to be
executed by a representative of the Company, with respect thereto; (iii) to
the extent not otherwise already available to Purchaser in the Data Room,
furnish Purchaser and its Debt Financing Sources as promptly as practicable
with copies of such financial and operating data and other pertinent
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses and assets as is reasonably requested by Purchaser or
any prospective lender and is customarily required for completion of such debt
financings, including, in any event, such financial information as is required
pursuant to any debt commitment letter; (iv) reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser's legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such
legal counsel may be required to deliver in connection with such debt
financing; (v) provide and, if applicable, execute (provided that no
obligation under any such agreement, document or certificate shall be
effective until the Closing) at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date (to the extent requested at least eight business days prior to
the Closing Date), all documentation and other information required by bank
regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer", "beneficial
ownership" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, \t\t

all conditions precedent applicable to the Purchaser and in the Purchaser's
control set forth in any debt commitment letter with respect to such debt
financing to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the
cooperation of or is within the control of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to cause officers of the
Company to execute agreements, documents or certificates reasonably requested
by the Purchaser that facilitate the creation, perfection or enforcement of
mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances or other security interests
securing such debt financing (including control agreements and perfection
certificates) as are requested by the Purchaser or its Debt Financing Sources
(provided that no action to evidence or perfect any security interest intended
to secure such debt financing shall be taken, and no obligation under any such
agreement, document or certificate shall be effective, until the Closing).
The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with such
debt financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees that
(i) the effectiveness of any definitive documentation executed by the Company
shall be subject to the consummation of the Closing; (ii) this Section 7.07
will not require the Company or any of its Affiliates to agree to any
contractual obligation relating to the financing that is not conditioned upon
the Closing and that does not terminate without liability to the Company or
any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms; (iii) on the Closing Date or following the termination of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the Company for all
documented out-of-pocket third party costs incurred by the Company in
connection with such cooperation; and (iv) the Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred in connection with the arrangement of such debt
financing or any assistance or activities provided in connection therewith
(other than arising from Fraud or misstatements or omissions in written
historical information of the type prepared by the Company in the ordinary
course of business that is provided by the Company specifically for use in
connection with such debt financing). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement or in any other agreement between the Company
and the Purchaser (or its Affiliates), the Company agrees that the Purchaser
and its Affiliates may share non-public or confidential information regarding
the Company and its businesses with its Debt Financing Sources, and that
Purchaser, its Affiliates and such Debt Financing Sources may share such
information with potential Debt Financing Sources in connection with any
marketing efforts (including any syndication) in connection with any debt
financing, provided that the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements for the benefit of the Company. \t\t

 \t\t\tCOVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to,
provide the Representative, on behalf of Members, the Optionholders and the
Warrantholders, with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to
the books and records of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date solely for
purposes of complying with any applicable tax, financial reporting or
regulatory requirements. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), neither the Purchaser nor the Surviving Entity shall, for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company for any
period prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the
Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Purchaser, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries may
intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.02 RandW Insurance. Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause Ambridge Partners, LLC (the "RandW Insurer") to effectuate
the buyer-side representations and warranties insurance policy, bound by the
RandW Insurer on the date hereof, having terms and conditions as set forth in
the Binder Agreement dated the date hereof and delivered to the Representative
(as may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with this Agreement) (the "RandW Policy"). Purchaser shall cause the RandW Policy
to provide that the RandW Insurer has no subrogation rights against any Member
except solely in the case of Fraud, and Purchaser will not amend the
subrogation or third-party beneficiary provisions contained in the RandW Policy
benefitting the Members or otherwise amend or modify the RandW Policy in a
manner that would have an adverse effect on the Members without the prior
written consent of the Representative. Purchaser agrees to pay the total
premium and related taxes, fees and expenses for the RandW Policy. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the effectiveness
of the RandW Policy is not a condition to the Closing and that Purchaser shall
remain obligated, subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article IV, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.03 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, the Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to purchase from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
a prepaid insurance policy (i.e., "tail coverage") on terms no less favorable
(including in with respect to scope) as the policy or policies maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing for
the benefit of such individuals (such policies, the "DandO Tail Policies");
provided, that the premium for the DandO Tail Policies shall be borne by the
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the
Surviving Entity's or any of its Subsidiaries' certificate of formation,
articles of incorporation, limited liability company agreement or bylaws (or
equivalent governing \t\t

 \t\t\tdocuments) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
officers, directors or similar functionaries (unless to provide for greater
exculpation or indemnification or unless required by Law), it being the intent
of the parties hereto that the current and former officers, directors and
similar functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification (including with respect to
advancement of expenses) to the full extent of the Law. The Purchaser agrees
and acknowledges that this Section 8.03 shall be binding on the Purchaser's
successors and assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If the Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 8.03. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if any Action (whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is
brought against any individual who was an officer, director or similar
functionary of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective
Time or any other party covered by directors' and officers' liability
insurance, on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 8.03 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) The obligations under this Section 8.03 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee
or exculpee to whom this Section 8.03 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee or exculpee. The provisions of this Section 8.03 are
intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by (as express
third‑party beneficiaries), each current and former officer, director or
similar functionary of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs
and representatives, successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have had by contract or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, following the Closing, any amount becomes due from any director, officer,
Member, Optionholder, Warrantholder or other Person as a result of an Action
resulting from, arising out of or relating to or asserting Fraud with respect
to the representations and warranties in this Agreement, then such Person
shall not have any rights against Purchaser, the Surviving Entity, their
respective Subsidiaries, or their respective directors, officers or employees
(in their capacity as such), whether by reason of contribution,
indemnification, subrogation or otherwise, in respect of any such amounts, and
such Person shall not take any Action against Purchaser, the Surviving Entity,
their respective Subsidiaries or any such director, officer or employee with
respect thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.04 Regulatory Filings. Subject to Section 10.03, the Purchaser
shall (a) make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under any Laws
or regulations applicable to the Purchaser required for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation, all
filings and submissions under the HSR Act, (b) coordinate and cooperate with
the Company in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as
the Company may reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing and
(c) (i) supply promptly any \t\t

obtained, all consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all
Governmental Bodies that may be or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement and the agreements contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.05 Contact with Business Relations. The Purchaser is not
authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any officer, manager,
employee, customer, supplier, distributor or other material business relation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing without the
prior written consent and coordination of the Company (not to be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.06 Continuing Confidentiality. The Purchaser shall remain bound
by that certain confidentiality agreement, dated as of October 8, 2018, with
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and shall be responsible for
any breaches of the Confidentiality Agreement by any of the Purchaser's
representatives, in each case in accordance with the terms thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t8.07 Payments to Optionholders and Other Individuals. In order to
ensure compliance with applicable Tax withholding requirements, any wage
payments made hereunder to any Member, Optionholder or other individual
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, disbursements of any portion of the
Merger Consideration), shall be made through the payroll processing system of
the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries. To ensure compliance with
Treasury Regulation 1.409A‑3(i)(5)(iv), the Optionholders shall not be
entitled to receive any payment, and no payment shall be made to the
Optionholders, in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby later
than the date which is five (5) years after the Closing Date (it being
understood that the Members may receive payments after the date which is five
(5) years after the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt,
amounts that, if paid prior to the date which is five (5) years after the
Closing Date, would have been paid to the Optionholders). \t\t

fulfilled by the date that is sixty five (65) calendar days after the date of
this Agreement; provided, that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant

force and effect (other than this Section 9.02, Article I, Section 12.02,

relieve any party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from any
willful breach by such party of this Agreement. For purposes of

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein contained
shall require, or be construed to require, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or
after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of the Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions
relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to the Purchaser of the transactions

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTAX MATTERS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.01 Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter,
promptly when due, all sales Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes
and any other similar Taxes applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the
transactions contemplated hereunder shall be paid by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the
Representative shall cooperate with the Purchaser in the preparation of such
Tax Returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.02 Tax Returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The parties shall, and shall each cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide to the other party such cooperation and information, as
and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with preparing,
reviewing and filing of any Tax Return for a taxable period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date, determining liabilities for Taxes or a
right to refund of Taxes, or in conducting any audit or other action with
respect to Taxes, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, and relevant documents relating to rulings
and other determinations by any Tax Authority. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The parties shall, to the extent permitted or required
under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
period of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes. If the
Company and its Subsidiaries are permitted, but not required, under applicable
non-U.S., state or local Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
a taxable \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t\- 63 -  \t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tperiod, such day shall be treated as the last day of a taxable period.
For all purposes of this Agreement and for purposes of calculating the Closing
Working Capital and the Tax Liability Amount: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Income
Taxes or other Taxes based on or measured by gross or net sales, payments,
payroll, or receipts for a Straddle Period with respect to the Company shall
be apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date
and the portion of such period commencing on the day immediately following the
Closing Date, based on a closing of the books of the Company, as if the
Closing Date were the end of a Tax year, and each such portion of such period
shall be deemed to be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable
period), and taking into account any net operating losses, credits or
deductions of the Company generated in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. For purposes
of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable period
pursuant to this Section 11.02(b), the amount of any item that is taken into
account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the benefit of graduated Tax
rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated between the two portions of
the period in proportion to the number of days in each portion. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) In the case of any other Taxes for any Straddle Period that
are not described in clause (i) of this Section 11.02(b) (including any Taxes
based on capitalization, debt or equity interests authorized, issued or
outstanding, or any real property, personal property or similar ad valorem
Taxes), the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such taxable
period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the taxable period ending on (and including) the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, any Taxes
attributable to any action taken by the Purchaser or the Company or any
Subsidiary on the Closing Date but after the Closing or otherwise after the
Closing Date that is not in the ordinary course of business shall be allocated
to the taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Any U.S. federal or state or local Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to an Income Tax for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date that are partnership Tax Returns
shall be prepared by the Representative. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the past practices of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent required by applicable
Law. Such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the Representative) shall be provided to the Purchaser
for its review not later than twenty (20) days before the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (including extensions) if they would affect the Tax liability
of, or have an election that would be binding on, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, or if they
include an election or take a position inconsistent with the past practices of
the Company. If the Purchaser does not provide the \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tRepresentative with a written description of the items in the Tax
Returns that the Purchaser intends to dispute within ten (10) days following
the delivery to the Purchaser of such documents, the Purchaser shall be deemed
to have accepted and agreed to such documents in the form provided, and the
Representative shall thereafter cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed by
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary in the form provided to the
Purchaser. The Representative shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by the Purchaser and any timely-raised issues arising as a
result of the review of such Tax Returns to permit the filing of such Tax
Returns as promptly as possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.03 Characterization and Allocation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Purchaser and the Representative on behalf of the
Members agree that the Merger shall be characterized as a transaction
described in Rev. Rul. 99-6, Situation 2, 1999-1 C.B. 432, and shall not take
any inconsistent positions for Tax purposes. As promptly as practicable after
the Closing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Representative a purchase
price allocation statement, which shall be prepared consistent with Exhibit F
(the "Allocation Statement"), along with any workpapers used in connection
with the preparation of the Allocation Statement. The Representative shall
have thirty (30) days to provide written comments to the Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall incorporate any reasonable comments timely received from the
Representative in a final Allocation Statement. Neither the Purchaser, the
Company nor any former Member may take a position inconsistent
therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If at the time of the Closing, an election under Section
754 of the Code is not in effect for Orbis Education Management Company, LLC,
the parties hereto agree that, upon the Purchaser's request, an election under
Section 754 of the Code shall be made in accordance with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.754-1(b) by Orbis Education Management Company, LLC on its federal
income Tax Return for the Tax period that includes the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.04 Section 338 and 336(e) of the Code. No party to this
Agreement shall make an election under Section 338(g) or 336(e) of the Code
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.05 Termination of Tax‑Sharing Agreements. All Tax Sharing
Agreements with respect to or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the
Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.06 No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The Purchaser shall
not take any action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the
Company or the Surviving Entity subsequent to the Closing that would cause the
transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that is
the same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2001‑16, 2001 C.B. 730,
and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008‑20 I.R.B. 2008 6 (January 17, 2008),

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by either the Purchaser or the Company without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided, that each of the Purchaser, the

under any of their secured debt financing arrangements. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.05 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this

invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.06 Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict
or otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed
(including whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules,
or exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in
the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. The information contained in this
Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any
third‑party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach
of contract). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.07 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any
provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may
be amended or waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser, the Company
and the Representative. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or
default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or
prior or subsequent breach or default. No amendment or waiver to this Section
12.07 or Section 12.09, 12.11 or 12.19 or any defined term used therein (or
to any other provision or definition of \t\t

therein) that is adverse to any Debt Financing Source shall be effective as to
such Debt Financing Source without the written consent of such Debt Financing
Source. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.08 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.09 Third‑Party Beneficiaries. The Members, the Optionholders and
the Warrantholders are third‑party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may
suffer losses for any breach of this Agreement by Purchaser (or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Entity or the Merger Sub). The provisions of this
Agreement are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the
Representative for the benefit of, the Members, Optionholders and
Warrantholders, and the Representative shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to enforce any obligations of the Purchaser, Merger Sub, or the
Surviving Entity under this Agreement for the benefit of the Members,
Optionholders and Warrantholders. Section 8.03 shall be enforceable by each
of the current and former officers, managers or similar functionaries of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred to in
this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement, the Members, the Optionholders, the Warrantholders and, for
purposes of Section 8.03, each of the current and former officers, managers or
similar functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs
and representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or
with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Debt Financing
Source is intended to be, and shall be, an express third-party beneficiary of
this Section 12.09 and Sections 12.07, 12.11 and 12.19. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to
the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto, each other
party hereto or thereto shall re execute the original form of this Agreement
and deliver such form to all other parties hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.11 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All issues and questions
concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of
this Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all claims and
disputes arising hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or
therewith, whether purporting to sound in contract or tort, or at law or in
equity, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict
of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other \t\t

jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby
agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent such court declines
jurisdiction, first to any federal court, or second, to any state court, each
located in Wilmington, Delaware, and hereby waive the right to assert the lack
of personal or subject matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection
with any such suit, action or other proceeding. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto (a) waives the defense of inconvenient
forum, (b) agrees not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby other than in
any such court, and (c) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action
or other proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit or judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LITIGATION, ACTION, PROCEEDING, CROSS‑CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE,
INTERPRETATION, COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR (ii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH
PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) each party hereto hereby submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York and the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and any appellate courts thereof
with respect to any suit, action or proceeding against any Debt Financing
Source in connection with this Agreement, any debt financing or any debt
commitment letter in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity
and whether in tort, contract or otherwise, and hereby agrees that it will not
bring or support any such suit, action or proceeding in any other forum, and
(ii) each party hereto hereby waives any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect to any suit, action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source
in connection with this Agreement, any debt financing or any debt commitment
letter in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and
whether in tort, contract or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.12 Consents. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties
to contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party (including the contracts set forth on the Contracts
Schedule) and such consents have not been obtained. The Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that neither the Members (including the Representative) nor the
Optionholders nor the Warrantholders shall have any liability whatsoever to
the Purchaser (or, after the Closing, the Surviving Entity) (and the
Purchaser, or after the Closing, the Surviving Entity, shall not be entitled
to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default,
acceleration or termination of any such contract, lease, license or other
agreement as a result thereof; provided, that there is no breach of this
Agreement. \t\t

The Representative and its Non‑Recourse Parties shall have no liability in
respect of any action, claim or proceeding brought against any such Person by
any Member, Optionholder or Warrantholder, regardless of the legal theory

sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, if
any such Person took or omitted taking any action in good faith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) If the Representative pays or causes to be paid any amounts
(on behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders) in connection
with any obligation or liability of a Member, Optionholder or Warrantholder in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the adjustment of Closing Cash Proceeds contemplated by
Section 3.03), any such payments and the reasonable expenses of the
Representative incurred in administering or defending the underlying dispute
or claim may be reimbursed, when and as incurred, from the Representative

in the performance of its duties hereunder, the Representative shall
distribute, or caused to be distributed, all remaining funds held by it on
behalf of the Members, Optionholders and Warrantholders to the Members,

entitled to receive any payment, and no payment shall be made to the

obligation, and (ii) instructions for remittance of such amount to the
