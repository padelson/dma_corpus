(whether written or oral) received from the FCO (in each case, to the extent
permitted by law or regulation).

16\. FURTHER ASSURANCES

16.1 On or after Completion each Seller shall (in respect of the Securities
held by it only), execute and do (or procure to be executed and done by any
other necessary party) all such deeds, documents, acts and things as may be
required by law or as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably require
in order to vest any of the Securities in the Purchaser.

16.2 For so long after Completion as any Seller or any nominee of it remains
the registered holder of any Security, it shall hold (or direct the relevant
nominee to hold) that Security and any distributions, property and rights
deriving from it in trust for the Purchaser and shall deal with that Security
and any distributions, property and rights deriving from it as the Purchaser
directs.

17\. POST COMPLETION UNDERTAKINGS

 

17.1 For a period of six years following Completion, the Purchaser shall make
available to any Seller, at such Sellers expense, the Books and Records
of the Group Companies in respect of the period prior to Completion which are
reasonably required by that Seller for the purpose of dealing with its tax and
accounting affairs. Such access to these Books and Records shall be granted
upon reasonable notice by the Seller and, subject to there being no material
disruption to the business of any Group Company, the Purchaser shall procure
that such Books and Records are made available to the Seller for inspection
(during normal working hours) and, where reasonably required for the purpose
of dealing with such affairs, copying (at the Sellers expense).

17.2 For a period of nine months following Completion, the Institutional
Seller shall preserve and maintain its corporate existence and not propose or
pass any resolution for the winding up of the Institutional Seller.

 

17.3 To ensure compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement and
the Securities Act with respect to the Share Equity Consideration, each
Seller agrees that Amplify may issue appropriate "stop-transfer" instructions
to its transfer agent, if any. Amplify shall not be required (i) to transfer
on its books any portion of the Share Equity Consideration that have been sold
or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or applicable securities laws or (ii) to treat as owner of such
portion of the Share Equity Consideration, or to accord the right to vote or
pay dividends, to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such portion of
the Share Equity Consideration has been purportedly so transferred.

 



37 17.4 Each book-entry security entitlement representing any Share Equity
Consideration (or any other securities issued in respect of such shares upon
any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or
similar event) issued to or held by any Seller in accordance with the terms
hereof shall bear the following legends (in addition to any other legends
required by law or governing documents of Amplify):

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE. THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY
AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS PERMITTED UNDER THE
ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR
EXEMPTION THEREFROM. INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO
BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME.
THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY
PROPOSED TRANSFER OR RESALE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

 

THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY MAY BE TRANSFERRED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE STOCKHOLDER, A COPY OF WHICH
IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY.

The first legend set forth in this clause 17.4 shall be removed by Amplify
from any book-entry security entitlement evidencing the Share Equity
Consideration upon delivery by the holder thereof to Amplify of a written
request to that effect if at the time of such written request (i) a
registration statement under the Securities Act is at that time in effect
with respect to the legended security or (ii) the legended security can be
freely transferred in a transaction in compliance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act without such a registration pursuant to which Amplify issued
the Share Equity Consideration, and, in the case of (ii) above, upon the
request and in the discretion of Amplify or its transfer agent, the holder of
such Share Equity Consideration (x) executes and delivers a representation
letter that includes customary representations satisfactory to Amplify and
its transfer agent regarding the holding requirements under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and whether such holder is an "affiliate" of Amplify for
purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and (y) secures the delivery to
Amplifys transfer agent of an opinion by counsel for Amplify, that such
security can be freely transferred in a public sale in compliance with Rule
144 under the Securities Act or otherwise without a registration statement
pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and that such transfer will not jeopardize the exemption or
exemptions from registration pursuant to which Amplify issued the
Share Equity Consideration; provided, that such opinion need not opine on
whether or not such holder is an "affiliate" for purposes of Rule 144 under
the Securities Act.

 

17.5 Each Seller acknowledges and the Purchaser shall procure that each Group
Company acknowledges that the Purchaser may make an election pursuant to
Section 338(g) of the Code (a "Section 338(g) Election") with respect to any
Group Company that is a foreign corporation within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(5) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code") in connection with the transactions effected and/or contemplated
pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that a Section 338(g) Election is

 



38  made, the Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing any applicable
purchase price allocation for Tax purposes, and the Purchaser shall, and shall
procure that each applicable Group Company shall, and the Sellers shall each
file all Tax Returns, and execute such other documents as may be required by
any Governmental Authority, in a manner consistent with such purchase price
allocation. The Purchaser, the Group Companies, and the Sellers agree not to
take any position inconsistent with any Section 338(g) Election or related
purchase price allocation.

18\. ASSIGNMENTS

 

No party may assign, transfer, charge or otherwise deal with all or any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement nor grant, declare, create or
dispose of any right or interest in it, save that:

18.1 the Institutional Seller may assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of
this Agreement to any Institutional Sellers Permitted Assignee, provided
that if such assignee ceases to be an Institutional Sellers Permitted
Assignee, all benefits relating to this Agreement assigned to such assignee
shall be deemed automatically by that fact to be re-assigned to the
Institutional Seller immediately before such cessation;

18.2 the Purchaser may assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of this
Agreement to any other member of the Purchasers Group, provided that if such
assignee ceases to be a member of the Purchasers Group, all benefits relating
to this Agreement assigned to such assignee shall be deemed automatically
by that fact to be re-assigned to the agreement immediately before such
cessation; and

18.3 the Purchaser or any member of the Purchasers Group may charge and/or
assign (in whole or in part) the benefit of this Agreement to any person
providing debt financing and/or hedging facilities to the Purchaser or any
member of the Purchasers Group or to any security agent or any person or
persons acting as trustee, nominee or agent for any such person by way of
security for the facilities being made or to be made available to the
Purchaser or member of the Purchasers Group and any such person, security
agent, trustee, nominee or agent may also, in the event of enforcement of
such security in accordance with its terms, assign the benefit of such
obligations and rights to a purchaser or assignee who acquires the Company or
all or part of its business from that person, security agent, trustee,
nominee or agent (or any receiver appointed by any of them), provided that any
such assignee shall not be entitled to receive under this Agreement any
greater amount than that to which the assignor would have been entitled
and neither the Purchaser nor any Seller, as applicable, shall be under any
greater obligation or liability than if such assignment had never occurred.

19. PAYMENTS

19.1 Unless otherwise expressly stated (or as otherwise agreed in writing in
the case of a given payment), each payment to be made under this Agreement or
any of the Transaction Documents shall be made in British pounds sterling by
transfer of the relevant amount into the relevant account on or before the
date the payment is due for value on that date. The relevant account for
a given payment is:

(a) if that payment is to any of the Institutional Sellers, the account of the
Institutional Sellers Solicitors (details of which have been provided to the
Purchasers Solicitors) and the receipt of the Institutional Sellers
Solicitors shall be a sufficient discharge for the Purchaser of its
obligations under this clause 19.1 and the Purchaser shall not be
concerned to see to the application thereof or be responsible for the loss or
misapplication of such sum, or such other account as the Institutional Seller
shall, not less than three Business Days before the date that payment is due,
have specified for payments to the Institutional Sellers by giving notice to
the Purchaser for the purpose of that payment;

 



39 (b) if that payment is to any of the Management Sellers, the account of the
Management Sellers Solicitors (details of which have been provided to the
Purchasers Solicitors) and the receipt of the Management Sellers Solicitors
shall be a sufficient discharge for the Purchaser of its obligations under
this clause 19.1 and the Purchaser shall not be concerned to see to the
application thereof or be responsible for the loss or misapplication of such
sum, or such other account as the Management Representatives shall, not less
than three Business Days before the date that payment is due, have specified
for payments to that Management Seller by giving notice to the Purchaser for
the purpose of that payment; and

(c) if that payment is to the Purchaser, such account of the Purchaser as the
Purchaser shall, not less than three Business Days before the date that
payment is due, have specified by giving notice to the Institutional Seller
and the Management Representatives for the purpose of that payment.

20\. GROSS UP

20.1 All amounts due under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents
shall be paid in full, without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or
withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax required by law).
If any deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from any of
the sums payable under this Agreement, the paying party shall provide any
evidence of the relevant withholding as the receiving party may reasonably
require and shall, save in relation to interest, pay to the receiving party
any sum as will, after the deduction or withholding is made, leave the
receiving party with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive
without that deduction or withholding.

 

20.2 Payments made under clause 20.1 shall be subject to the financial
limitations set out in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of the Management Warranty
Deed.

 

20.3 If a payment is to be made under this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents to a person other than the original Purchaser or the original
Seller, then the paying party shall be required to make an increased payment
pursuant to clause 20.1 only to the extent that such an increased payment
would have been required to be made had the recipient of the payment been the
original Purchaser or the original Seller.

21\. GENERAL

21.1 Each of the obligations, warranties and undertakings set out in this
Agreement (excluding any obligation which is fully performed at Completion)
shall continue in force after Completion.

 



40 21.2 Where any obligation, representation, warranty or undertaking in this
Agreement is expressed to be made, undertaken or given by two or more of the
Sellers, they shall (unless otherwise expressly provided to the contrary) be
severally (and not jointly or jointly and severally) responsible in respect of
it.

 

21.3 The Purchaser may release or compromise in whole or in part the liability
of any of the Sellers under this Agreement or grant any time or indulgence

21.4 Any consent given in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by
the Management Representatives in connection with this Agreement shall bind

it to perform the obligation by a specified time and stating that time is of
the essence in relation to that obligation.

21.6 The Purchaser shall procure that a Group Company shall pay the Sellers
Transaction Expenses on Completion. The Purchaser shall pay any stamp duty or

this Agreement by executing a counterpart.

21.8 The rights of each party under this Agreement:

 

(a) may be exercised as often as necessary;

(b) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, are cumulative
and not exclusive of rights and remedies provided by law; and

(c) may be waived only in writing and specifically.

Delay in exercising or non-exercise of any such right is not a waiver of that
right.

under clause 4.6, 6.5 or 6.6.

 

21.10 Except as otherwise expressly stated in this Agreement, a person who is

Document) shall be valid unless it is in writing and duly executed by or on
behalf of all of the parties to it.

21.13 The provisions contained in each clause and sub-clause of this
Agreement shall be enforceable independently of each of the others and their
validity shall not be affected if any of the others are invalid. If any of
those provisions is void but would be valid if some part of the
provision were deleted, the provision in question shall apply with such
modification as may be necessary to make it valid.

22\. WHOLE AGREEMENT

agreement between the parties relating to the Transaction and supersede all
previous agreements, whether oral or in writing, between the parties relating
to these transactions.

22.2 Each party:

 

(a) acknowledges that in agreeing to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents it has not relied on any express or implied
representation, warranty, collateral contract or other assurance made by or
on behalf of any other party before the entering into of this Agreement and
not expressly incorporated in this Agreement or any other Transaction

any liability for, or remedy in respect of, fraud.

23.1 The Management Representatives shall be entitled to carry out the
functions expressly conferred on them by this Agreement only.

 

23.2 The Management Sellers hereby appoint the Management Representatives,
acting jointly, to act as their representative and agree that, subject to
clause 23.3, the Purchaser may rely, without enquiry, upon any action of the
Management Representatives as the act of the Management Sellers in all matters
referred to in this Agreement as being carried out by the Management
Representatives, provided that the parties expressly agree that the
Management Representatives shall not have the power or authority to negotiate,
agree or settle any matter relating to a claim under this Agreement on behalf
of any Management Seller without the prior express written authorisation of
that Management Seller.

this Agreement and such appointment shall be promptly (and in any event within

writing.

 

23.4 The Management Sellers undertake that a Management Representative shall
be appointed at all times.

 

23.5 Each Management Seller agrees that the Management Representatives owes no
responsibility, duty of care or liability whatsoever in connection with

accordingly, except in respect of the Retained Liabilities, the Management
Representative shall not be liable to any other Management Seller for any act
or omission in connection with the performance by him of any of his duties,
functions or role as Management Representative pursuant to this Agreement.
Except in respect of the Retained Liabilities, each Management Seller agrees
not to bring any action or claim against a Management Representative in
connection with his appointment as a Management Representative and/or in
relation to any action which the Management Representative has taken or
omitted to take in the past or may in the future take or omit to take in his
capacity as a Management Representative.

23.6 Each Management Seller hereby undertakes to indemnify and keep
indemnified and hold harmless each Management Representative from all losses,
costs, damages, expenses (including professional fees) and any other
liabilities that may be incurred by such Management Representative (in that
capacity) as a result of the performance of his duties, functions and role as
a Management Representative under this Agreement, provided that no Management
Representative shall be entitled to indemnification for and in respect of the
Retained Liabilities or any matter where his actions or inactions are in
breach of this Agreement.

24\. SERVICE OF PROCESS

 

24.1 The Institutional Seller irrevocably appoints Investcorp Securities
Limited (registered number 02217792) of 48 Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, London
W1K 3HW as its agent to receive and acknowledge on its behalf service of any
writ, summons, order, judgment or other notice in connection with any
proceeding, suit or action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
in England and Wales ("Proceedings"). If the agent named above (or its
successor) at any time ceases for any reason to act as such or have an address
in England or Wales, the Institutional Seller shall appoint a replacement
agent having an address for service in England or Wales and shall notify the
Purchaser of the name and address of the replacement agent. Failing such
appointment and notification, the Purchaser shall be entitled by notice to the
Institutional Seller to appoint a replacement agent to act on behalf of the
Institutional Seller. This clause 24.1 applying to service on an agent applies
equally to service on a replacement agent. The Institutional Seller further
agrees that any Proceedings shall be sufficiently served on it if delivered
to such agent for service at its address for the time being in England or
Wales whether or not such agent gives notice thereof to the Institutional
Seller.

 



43 24.2 Each of Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and Jochen Krumm irrevocably
appoints the Management Representatives as his agent to receive and
acknowledge on its behalf service of any Proceedings and the Management
Representatives agree to provide notice to Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and
Jochen Krumm (as applicable) informing them that such service
documentation have been issued in connection with Proceedings following
receipt and copies of such documents. If the agent named above (or its
successor) at any time ceases for any reason to act as such or have an address
in England or Wales, each of Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and Jochen Krumm
shall appoint a replacement agent having an address for service in England or
Wales and shall notify the Purchaser of the name and address of the
replacement agent. Failing such appointment and notification, the Purchaser
shall be entitled by notice to the Management Representatives to appoint a
replacement agent to act on behalf of Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and Jochen
Krumm. This clause 24.2 applying to service on an agent applies equally to
service on a replacement agent. Each of Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and
Jochen Krumm further agrees that any Proceedings shall be sufficiently served
on him if delivered to such agent for service at its address for the time
being in England or Wales whether or not such agent gives notice thereof to
Brendan Harris, Andrew Blain and Jochen Krumm.

24.3 The Purchasers Guarantor irrevocably appoints the Purchaser as its
agent to receive and acknowledge on its behalf service of any Proceedings. If
the agent named above (or its successor) at any time ceases for any reason to
act as such or have an address in England or Wales, the Purchasers Guarantor
shall appoint a replacement agent having an address for service in England or
Wales and shall notify the Institutional Seller of the name and address of the
replacement agent. Failing such appointment and notification, the
Institutional Seller shall be entitled by notice to the Purchasers Guarantor
to appoint a replacement agent to act on behalf of the Purchasers Guarantor.
This clause 24.3 applying to service on an agent applies equally to service on
a replacement agent. The Purchasers Guarantor further agrees that any
Proceedings shall be sufficiently served on it if delivered to such agent for
service at its address for the time being in England or Wales whether or not
such agent gives notice thereof to the Purchasers Guarantor.

25\. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

 

25.1 This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance
with, English law.

25.2 The English courts have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute,
claim or controversy arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
(including a dispute, claim or controversy relating to any non-contractual
obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement) and the
parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

 

25.3 The parties waive any objection to the English courts on grounds that
they are an inconvenient or inappropriate forum to settle any such dispute.

 

25.4 Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
any legal action or proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or
relating to this Agreement and the Transaction and for any counterclaim
therein (in each case whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise). Each party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, amongst other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this clause.

 



44 AS WITNESS this Agreement is executed as a deed by the parties (or their duly
authorised representatives) and is delivered and takes effect on the date at
the beginning of this Agreement.
