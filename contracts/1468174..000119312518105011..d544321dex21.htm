licenses or other items are provided to other hotels which are owned, leased
or operated by any Affiliate of Seller or Manager, in addition to the Hotel

foregoing, after the Closing, certain of the National/Regional Operating
Agreements may continue to be utilized at the Hotel pursuant to and subject to
the terms of the New Management Agreement Documents.

(h) _Liquor License_. With respect to the SF Hotel, Purchaser acknowledges
that the Liquor License and all alcoholic beverage inventories are not held
by SF Seller but are held by Manager, and that, as of Closing, Manager shall
continue to hold such Liquor License and alcoholic beverage inventories
pursuant to the New Management Agreement Documents for the SF Hotel at no
additional charge to Purchaser.

 



15 (i) _Retained Liabilities_. The Property shall also expressly exclude the
following, which shall be retained by Seller from and after the Closing: all

concerning, (i) all liabilities under the Tenant Leases, Equipment Leases,

avoidance of doubt, the Retained Liabilities do not include any liabilities
relating to the physical condition of the Property (including without
limitation the environmental condition of the Real Property) or any matters
that are the subject of any representations and warranties in this Agreement.

PURCHASE PRICE; EARNEST MONEY; LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE

 

Section 3.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Property is One
Billion and no/100 Dollars ($1,000,000,000.00) (the " _Purchase Price_ "),
which shall be adjusted at the Closing for the Prorations and the Accounts
Receivable pursuant to _Sections 10.1_ and _10.2_ respectively. The Purchase
Price shall be allocated among the Property in accordance with _Section
3.2_.

Section 3.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Purchaser agree that
the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Properties as set forth on
_Schedule 3.2_ , and, to the extent that transfer tax filings for any Property
require that the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Property be
further allocated among classifications of property, such Property allocation
shall be further allocated among the Land, Improvements and Personal Property
for such Property as set forth on _Schedule 3.2_ for transfer tax purposes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser each reserve the right to
allocate among such classifications in its discretion for all other federal,
state and local tax purposes and financial accounting purposes. This _Section
3.2_ shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 3.3 _Earnest Money_.

 

(a) _Earnest Money_. On the Effective Date, Purchaser shall deposit with
Escrow Agent the sum equal to Twenty-five Million and No/100 Dollars
($25,000,000.00) (plus any interested accrued thereon; the " _Earnest Money_
"), and the Earnest Money shall be non-refundable to Purchaser, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. The allocation of the
Earnest Money among each Property is set forth on _Schedule 3.2_ attached
hereto. Purchasers failure to timely deposit the full amount of the Earnest
Money shall be an immediate Purchaser Default and shall not be subject to any
cure rights set forth in _Section 12.2_ of the Agreement. The Earnest Money
shall be held by Escrow Agent in escrow (the " _Earnest Money Escrow_ ")
pursuant to the escrow agreement in form and substance mutually acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser to be entered into among Seller, Purchaser and Escrow
Agent (the " _Earnest Money Escrow Agreement_ "), and delivered to Escrow
Agent concurrently with the Earnest Money.

 



16 (b) _Investment of Earnest Money_. At Purchasers election, the Earnest Money
may be invested in any investments approved by Seller and Purchaser in
writing in accordance with the Earnest Money Escrow Agreement, and all
interest and other amounts earned on the Earnest Money shall be deemed
additional Earnest Money. All fees, costs and expenses of the Earnest Money
Escrow shall be shared equally between Seller and Purchaser, except that
Purchaser shall pay any fees, costs or expenses with respect to the investment
of the Earnest Money and Purchaser shall bear the risk of loss of the Earnest
Money.

(c) _Disbursement of Earnest Money_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall cause
Escrow Agent to disburse the Earnest Money to Seller, and Purchaser shall
receive a credit against the Purchase Price in the amount of the Earnest Money
disbursed to Seller, or if this Agreement is terminated, the Earnest Money
shall be disbursed by Escrow Agent to Seller or Purchaser in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Earnest Money Escrow Agreement.

Section 3.4 _Payment of Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay
to Escrow Agent, for disbursement to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount equal to the Purchase Price, _plus_ or _minus_ the
Prorations (as the case may be) pursuant to  _Section 10.1_, _plus_ Accounts
Receivable pursuant to _Section 10.2_ and _less_ the Earnest Money disbursed
to Seller. Purchaser shall cause the wire transfer of funds to be received by
Escrow Agent no later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the day of the
Closing (time is of the essence). Failure of Purchaser to cause the wire
transfer of funds to be received by Escrow Agent by such time in accordance
with this _Section 3.4_ shall be a default by Purchaser under this
Agreement.

Section 3.5 _Like-Kind Exchange_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each party acknowledges and agrees that any of the other
parties shall have the right at the Closing to designate a Property as
relinquished or replacement property, as appropriate in a transaction intended
to qualify as a tax-free exchange under Section 1031 of the Code (the " _Tax-
Free Exchange_ "). If any party elects to effect a Tax-Free Exchange pursuant
to this _Section 3.5_, such party shall provide written notice to the other
prior to the Closing, in which case such designating party shall enter into
an exchange agreement and other exchange documents with a "qualified
intermediary" and/or "exchange accommodation titleholder" (such intermediary
or titleholder, the " _Exchange Party_ ") pursuant to the Exchange Partys
standard form of such exchange documents (the " _Exchange Agreement_ "),
pursuant to which such designating party shall assign all of its right, title
and interest under this Agreement to the Exchange Party; provided, however,
that such assignment shall not relieve such designating party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and the designating party shall
unconditionally guarantee the full and timely performance by the Exchange
Party of each and every one of the representations, warranties, indemnities,
obligations and undertakings of the designating party under this Agreement
(and any amendments or modifications hereto) subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement. As such guarantor, the designating party shall be
treated as a primary obligor with respect to those representations,
warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings, shall be deemed to have
waived all applicable surety defenses, and in the event of a breach, the
other party may proceed directly against the designating party on this
guarantee without the need to join or seek performance or collection from the
Exchange Party. Each party shall execute and deliver such documents as may be
required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Tax-Free Exchange
which are in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such party, and
otherwise cooperate with the designating party in all reasonable respects to
effectuate the Tax-Free Exchange. Purchaser agrees that if any Seller elects
to effect a Tax-Free Exchange pursuant to this _Section 3.5_, the Earnest
Money shall be deposited with or transferred to the Exchange Party pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, subject to the same terms applicable thereto under
the Earnest Money Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this
_Section 3.5_, the Tax-Free Exchange shall not diminish the non-designating
partys rights, nor increase the non-designating partys obligations, under
this Agreement. Each party electing to effect a Tax-Free Exchange shall pay
for all fees, costs and expenses in connection with its Tax-Free Exchange.

 



17 Section 3.6 _Independent Contract Consideration_. Contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver to each Seller a check
in the amount of $100 (the " _Independent Contract Consideration_ "), which
amount the Parties bargained for and agreed to as consideration for each
Sellers grant to Purchaser of Purchasers right to purchase the Property
pursuant to the terms hereof and for each Sellers execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. The Independent Contract Consideration is in
addition to and independent of any other consideration or payment provided in
this Agreement, is nonrefundable under any circumstances and will be retained
by each Seller notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement.

(a) _No Contingency_. Purchaser has completed its due diligence review of the
Property and all matters related thereto prior to the Effective Date. By

sole and absolute discretion, subject to the representations, warranties and
covenants of Seller, with all aspects of the Property (including, but
not limited to, the physical and environmental condition of the Property).

(b) _Seller s Due Diligence Materials_. Purchaser acknowledges receipt of
the due diligence materials set forth on _Schedule 4.1(b)_ prior to the

shall provide a copy to Seller of all studies, reports, and assessments
prepared by any Person for or on behalf of Purchaser (other than any internal
studies, reports and assessments prepared by any of Purchasers employees,
attorneys, investors, bankers or accountants) in connection with transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Purchaser Due Diligence Reports_ "),
and if also requested by Seller, at Sellers cost and expense, Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an original of any such
Purchaser Due Diligence Reports for Seller, together with a reliance letter
from such Person in favor of Seller. This _Section 4.1(c)_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the Closing.

(d) _Release and Indemnification_. Purchaser shall, at its cost and expense,
repair any damage to the Property or any other property owned by a Person
other than Purchaser arising from or in connection with the Inspections, and
restore the Property or such other third-party property to the same condition
as existed prior to such Inspections. Purchaser hereby releases the Seller
Indemnitees for any Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitees arising from
or in connection with the Inspections, except to the extent resulting from a
Seller Indemnitees gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Purchaser
shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against any Losses incurred by
any Seller Indemnitees arising from or in connection with the Inspections.
Purchaser shall in no event be responsible under this  _Section 4.1(d)_ for
any condition already existing on the Property at the time of the Inspections,
except and only to the extent that Purchaser or the Inspections exacerbate
such existing condition. This _Section 4.1(d)_ shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the Closing.

 



18 (e) _Liens_. Purchaser shall not permit any mechanics or materialmens liens
to be filed against any part of the Real Property as a result of the
Inspections or of any of Purchasers Inspectors activities on or with respect
to the Real Property, including but not limited to, with respect to any labor
or materials furnished to the Real Property at Purchasers or Purchasers
Inspectors insistence or request. If any such lien is filed against any part
of the Real Property, Purchaser shall cause the same to be promptly discharged
of record and, to the extent not fully discharged of record, any such lien
shall be a Permitted Exception to which Purchaser agrees to accept the
conveyance of title to the Real Property for the purposes of this Agreement.
If Purchaser fails to have any such lien removed of record within thirty (30)
days following written notice from Seller, then Seller may cause the same to
be removed of record and recover from Purchaser all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Seller in connection therewith. Purchaser shall
indemnify, hold harmless and defend Seller, Manager and the Real Property from
and against any and all such liens. This _Section 4.1(e)_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 

(f) _Compliance with Laws_. Purchaser, at its own expense, shall comply (and
shall cause each of Purchasers Inspectors to comply) with all Applicable
Laws with respect to the Inspections and with respect to their activities on
or about the Real Property including, without limitation, those relating to
health, safety, noise, environmental protection, waste disposal, water
and air quality, and worker occupational health and safety, and shall furnish
to Seller reasonable evidence of such compliance upon request.

 

Section 4.2 _Title and Survey_.

 

(a) _Title Commitment_. Purchaser acknowledges receipt of (i) an ALTA owners
title insurance commitment from the Title Company with an effective date of
October 18, 2017 for the Maui Real Property, together with a copy of all
documents referenced therein (the " _Maui Title Commitment_ "); (ii) an ALTA
owners title insurance commitment from the Title Company with an effective
date of October 18, 2017 for the Coconut Point Real Property, together with a
copy of all documents referenced therein (the " _Coconut Point Title
Commitment_ "); and (iii) an ALTA owners title insurance commitment from the
Title Company with an effective date of October 13, 2017 for the SF Real
Property, together with a copy of all documents referenced therein (the " _SF
Title Commitment_ "; and together with the Coconut Point Title Commitment and
the SF Title Commitment, individually and/or collectively as the context may
require, the " _Title Commitment_ ").

 

(b) _Survey_. Purchaser acknowledges receipt of (i) a draft survey of the Maui
Hotel prepared by Commercial Due Diligence Services (collectively, the "
_Maui Survey_ "); (ii) a draft survey of the Coconut Point Hotel prepared by
Commercial Due Diligence Services (collectively, the " _Coconut Point Survey_
"); and (iii) a draft survey of the SF Hotel prepared by Commercial Due
Diligence Services (collectively, the " _SF Survey_ "; and together with the
Maui Survey and the Coconut Point Survey, individually and/or collectively as
the context may require, the " _Survey_ ").

(c) _Approval of Title and Survey; Seller Cure Items_. Purchaser and Seller
hereby agree that the items listed on _Schedule 4.2_ hereto are the "
_Permitted Exceptions_ ". At or before Closing, Seller shall either cure or
cause the Title Company to provide affirmative insurance coverage over (i) any
mortgage lien, (ii) any mechanics or materialmens lien filed in connection
with work performed by or for Seller unless such liens are bonded over by
Seller, (iii) any lien securing a monetary amount and granted or expressly
consented to by Seller, and (iv) any other monetary liens (not to exceed Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate created by, through or
under Seller that may be removed by the payment of a liquidated sum of money
(such items, together with any other items that Seller otherwise agrees in
writing to cure, collectively, " _Seller Cure Items_ "). Seller may use a
portion of the Purchase Price to cure any Seller Cure Items at the Closing,
and if at Closing there are any uncured Seller Cure Items that can be cured
by payment of a liquidated sum of money, then Escrow Agent shall use a portion
of the Purchase Price allocated to the affected Property to cure such uncured
Seller Cure Items.

 



19 (d) _Updates to Title and Survey_. If any supplement or revision to the
Title Commitment or Survey issued subsequent to the Effective Date contains
any exceptions to title that were not disclosed in a Title Commitment or
Survey provided to Purchaser prior to the Effective Date, which are not
Permitted Exceptions, which were not caused by Purchaser or any Person acting
on behalf of Purchaser and which would have a material adverse effect on the
value of, title to or use or operation of the applicable Property (any such
new title exception shall hereinafter be referred to as an " _Unpermitted
Exception_ "), then Purchaser shall have the right to object to such new
Unpermitted Exception(s) by written notice of objection to Seller on or before
the fifth (5th) Business Day (but in any event, no later than the Closing
Date) after Purchasers receipt of the supplement to the Title Commitment
showing such exceptions. Seller may elect, by delivering a written notice to
Purchaser (a " _Seller Cure Notice_ ") no later than three (3) Business Days
following receipt of Purchasers notice of any Unpermitted Exception (the "
_Exception Election Period_ "), to cure such Unpermitted Exception by removing
the same from title or causing the Title Company to delete from the Title
Commitment or commit to insure over the same in a manner that is reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser. Sellers failure to deliver a Seller Cure Notice
within the Exception Election Period shall be deemed Sellers election not to
cure any Unpermitted Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Purchaser shall be deemed to have objected to, and Seller shall be
deemed to have elected to cure, any such Unpermitted Exception that is also a
Seller Cure Item. If Seller elects or is deemed to have elected not to cure
any Unpermitted Exception(s), Purchaser shall have the option, to be exercised
by delivery of written notice to Seller no later than three (3) Business Days
following receipt of the Seller Cure Notice or expiration of the Exception
Election Period, as applicable, to (i) terminate this Agreement with respect
to the applicable Property affected by the Unpermitted Exception, in which
case Escrow Agent shall promptly refund the Earnest Money to Purchaser with
respect to the applicable Property and Seller and Purchaser shall have no
further rights or obligations under this Agreement with respect to such
Property, except those which expressly survive such termination, including
without limitation Purchasers satisfaction of its obligation under _Section
4.1(c)_, _4.1(d)_ , and _7.1(b)_ , or (ii) proceed to the Closing under this
Agreement and accept title to the Real Property, subject to such uncured
Unpermitted Exception(s) (which shall thereafter be deemed to be Permitted
Exceptions), without any credit against the Purchase Price for any such
uncured Unpermitted Exception(s). If Purchaser does not terminate this
Agreement under clause (i) of the preceding sentence by the expiration of such
three (3) Business Day period for Purchaser to do so, Purchaser shall be
deemed to have elected the option in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Closing Date
with respect to such Property or all Properties, at Sellers election, shall
be extended to the fifth (5th) Business Day after the later of: (x) in the
event Seller has elected to cure any Unpermitted Exception, Sellers delivery
to Purchaser of a supplement to the Title Commitment evidencing Sellers cure
of any Unpermitted Exception in accordance with this _Section 4.2(d)_; and
(y) the expiration of Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement with
respect to the applicable Property during the three (3) Business Day period
following the receipt of the Seller Cure Notice or the expiration of the
Exception Election Period, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 4.2(d)_
with respect to the applicable Property affected by such Unpermitted
Exception, Seller shall have the right, within ten (10) days of Purchasers
election to terminate, to elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to
the other Properties. If Seller fails to make an election within such time
period, Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to
Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties.

 

(e) _Other Title Company_. If the Title Company does not agree to remove,
waive or insure over any Unpermitted Exception(s), but another nationally
recognized, financially sound title insurance company that is reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser is willing to issue the Title Policy without such
Unpermitted Exception(s), then Seller shall have the right to obtain, and
Purchaser shall accept, a Title Policy from such other title insurance
company which otherwise shall satisfy the requirements of _Section 8.2(d)_
(in which case the term "Title Company" shall be deemed to refer to such other
title insurance company, and the term "Escrow Agent" shall be deemed to refer
to the escrow agent of such other title insurance company for all purposes in
this Agreement).

 



20 (f) _Extension of Closing Date_. If Seller is unable to cure prior to the
Closing any Unpermitted Exceptions which Seller has elected in its sole
discretion to cure, Seller shall have the right to postpone the Closing and
extend the Closing Date for up to thirty (30) days by providing written notice
to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the originally
scheduled Closing Date with respect to the applicable Property affected by
such Unpermitted Exception or with respect to all Properties, at Sellers
election.

CODE § 2621.9); OR (F) A SEISMIC HAZARD ZONE (AND, IF APPLICABLE, WHETHER A

PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER HAS DIRECTED ESCROW AGENT TO RETAIN A
QUALIFIED PROVIDER TO EXAMINE THE MAPS AND OTHER INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE TO
THE PUBLIC BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING SELLER TO
FULFILL ITS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACT AND TO PREPARE THE

in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to all matters affecting
title to the Real Property, and any liens or other encumbrances affecting the
Real Property, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is relying upon the
Title Policy. If Purchaser has a claim under the Title Policy, the subject
matter of which may also constitute a breach of any representation, warranty,
or covenant made by Seller in this Agreement or in any Closing Document,
Purchaser shall look initially to the Title Policy for recovery on such claim
and Purchaser shall diligently pursue such claim against the Title Company
including all available appeals and only after exhausting such remedy shall
Purchaser make any claims against Seller with respect to such matters and
only to the extent Purchaser was unable to recover any amounts from the Title
Company; provided that, if Purchaser otherwise has a claim against Seller for
such title matter under the terms of this Agreement and Purchaser delivers a
claim notice with respect to any such claim in the manner (and within the
time period) described in _Section 5.5(B)_, such claim shall toll so long as
Purchaser continues to pursue its claim against the Title Company, but
Purchaser shall have no right to recover under such protective claim to the
extent Purchaser is able to recover any such amounts from the Title Company.
This Section shall survive the Closing.

 

ARTICLE V

SELLERS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Section 5.1 _Representations and Warranties_. To induce Purchaser to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transaction contemplated herein,
each Seller (severally and not jointly) hereby makes the representations and
warranties in this _Section 5.1_ with respect to itself and its Hotel and its
Property, as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing (except to the
extent that such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier
date, in which case it shall be true and correct as of such earlier date),
subject to the limitations set forth in  _Sections 4.3_, _5.2_ and _5.3_ ,
upon which each Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser is entitled to
rely.

warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall lapse and be of no
further force or effect after the last day of the Survival Period, except
with respect to any matter contained in a claim notice described in item (B)

the Closing Date is a day of income and expense for Purchaser. Purchaser shall

extent the same are accrued or due and payable but unpaid as of the Cut-Off
Time in which case Purchaser shall be obligated to pay such expense, and
Seller shall receive a credit for any of the items of expense in this _Section

the amount of any such Taxes is not ascertainable on the Closing Date, the
proration for such Taxes shall be based on the tax rates set forth in the most
recent available bill and the latest assessed valuation of the Property;
_provided, however_ , that after the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall

time to time from such tenants for periods after the month in which the
Closing occurs through the date of collection of such rentals or fees in order
to bring rentals or fees current for the periods after Closing; finally,
the balance, if any, to Seller. Purchaser and Seller agree to remit forthwith
to the other party the amount of such past due rentals, fees and charges to
which the other party is entitled to pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_. At
the Closing, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser all information necessary for

Contracts (other than for utilities which proration is addressed separately
in _Section 10.1(e)_) shall be prorated as of the Cut-Off Time between Seller
and Purchaser. Purchaser shall receive a credit for all deposits held by
Seller under the Contracts which are transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser
thereafter shall be obligated to refund or apply such deposits in accordance
with the terms of such Contracts. Seller shall receive a credit for all
deposits made by Seller under the Contracts which are transferred to
Purchaser or remain on deposit for the benefit of Purchaser.

provided, however, that after the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall
reprorate the amount for such utilities and pay any deficiency in the original
proration to the other Party promptly upon receipt of the actual bill for the
relevant billing period. Seller shall receive a credit for all fuel stored at
the Hotel based on Sellers cost for such fuel. Seller shall receive a credit
for all deposits transferred to Purchaser or which remain on deposit for the
benefit of Purchaser with respect to such utility contracts, otherwise such
deposits shall be refunded to Seller. The reproration obligation in this
_Section 10.1(e)_ shall survive the Closing.

 

(f) _Deposits for Bookings_. Purchaser shall receive a credit for all prepaid
deposits for Bookings scheduled for accommodations or events on or after the

Agreement, Seller shall receive a credit for all Retail Merchandise and
unopened boxes, crates and pallets of FandB based on Sellers cost for such

Price.

under another subsection of this _Section 10.1_, (i) Seller shall pay in
full prior to the Closing all amounts payable to vendors or other suppliers of
goods or services to the Hotel (the " _Trade Payables_ ") which are due and
payable as of the Closing Date for which goods or services have been
delivered to the Hotel prior to the Closing, and (ii) Purchaser shall receive
a credit for the amount of such Trade Payables which have accrued for goods or
services which have been delivered to the Hotel prior to the Closing, but are
not yet due and payable as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall pay all
such Trade Payables accrued as of the Closing Date when such Trade Payables
become due and payable up to the amount of such credit; provided, however,
Seller and Purchaser shall reprorate the amount of credit for any Trade
Payables and pay any deficiency in the original proration to the other Party
promptly upon receipt of the actual bill for such goods or services. Seller
shall receive a credit for all advance payments or deposits made with respect
to FFandE, Supplies, Attic Stock, FandB and Retail Merchandise, which has been
ordered, but not delivered to the Hotel prior to the Closing Date and

ARTICLE XI

 

TRANSITION PROCEDURES

 

Section 11.1 _Settlement Statement_. On or prior to the day prior to the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser, through their respective employees, agents or
representatives and KPMG (which shall be retained on behalf of both Seller and
Purchaser to do the Prorations), jointly shall make such examinations, audits
and inventories of the Property as may be necessary to make the adjustments
and Prorations to the Purchase Price as set forth in _Sections 10.1_ and
_10.2_ or any other provisions of this Agreement. Based upon such
examinations, audits and inventories, Seller and Purchaser shall jointly
prepare prior to the Closing a settlement statement (the " _Settlement
Statement_ "), which shall set forth Sellers and Purchasers best estimate of
the amounts of the items to be adjusted and prorated under this Agreement (it
being agreed that, at the election of any Party, there shall be separate
statements for each Hotel). The Settlement Statement shall be approved and
executed by Seller and Purchaser, and shall be binding and conclusive on
Seller and Purchaser with respect to the items set forth in the Settlement
Statement. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly prepare, as of the date that is
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, an updated Settlement Statement
reflecting any items which should have been included in the Settlement
Statement but were omitted therefrom or items which were incorrectly adjusted
or prorated therein, and such items shall be adjusted and prorated in the same
manner as if their existence or such error had been known at the time of
the preparation of the Settlement Statement, and the Party in whose favor
such original error or omission was made shall refund such difference to the
other Party within five (5) Business Days of the completion of such updated
Settlement Statement. Purchaser shall give Seller access to Purchasers books
and records from and after the Closing Date for the purpose of making the
adjustments contemplated by this _Section 11.1_. This _Section 11.1_ shall
survive the Closing.

 



45 Section 11.2 _Safe Deposit Boxes_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify,
or cause Manager to notify, all guests or customers who are then using a safe
deposit box at the Hotel advising them of the pending change in ownership and
operation of the Hotel and requesting them to conduct an inventory and verify
the contents of such safe deposit box. All inventories by such guests or
customers shall be conducted under the joint supervision of representatives of
Seller and Purchaser. Upon such inventory and verification, Seller shall
deliver, or cause Manager to deliver, to Purchaser all keys, receipts and
agreements for each such safe deposit box (and thereafter each such safe
deposit box shall be deemed an " _Inventoried Safe Deposit Box_ "), which, in
the alternative and at the direction of Purchaser, may be retained by Manager
pursuant to the New Management Agreement Documents. If the Closing does not
occur on the Closing Date for any reason whatsoever, Purchaser immediately
shall return all keys, receipts and agreements to Seller for such Inventoried
Safe Deposit Boxes. Upon the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser all
keys in Sellers Possession for all safe deposit boxes not then in use, and a
list of all safe deposit boxes which are then in use, but not yet
inventoried by the depositor (the " _Non-Inventoried Safe Deposit Boxes_ "),
with the name and room number of such depositor. After the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall make appropriate arrangements for guests and customers at the
Hotel to inventory and verify the contents of the Non-Inventoried Safe
Deposit Boxes, and upon such inventory and verification, Seller shall deliver
to Purchaser all keys, receipts and agreements for such safe deposit box (and
such safe deposit box thereafter shall constitute an Inventoried Safe Deposit
Box). Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any Losses incurred with respect to, any theft,
loss or damage to the contents of any safe deposit box from and after the
time such safe deposit box is deemed an Inventoried Safe Deposit Box pursuant
to this _Section 11.2_. Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against any Losses incurred, with respect
to, any theft, loss or damage to the contents of any safe deposit box prior to
the time such safe deposit box is deemed an Inventoried Safe Deposit Box. This
_Section 11.2_ shall survive the Closing.

 

Section 11.3 _Baggage_. On the Closing Date, representatives of Seller and
Purchaser jointly shall make a written inventory of all baggage, boxes and
similar items checked in or left in the care of Seller at the Hotel, and
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the keys to any secured area in which such
baggage and other items are stored (the " _Inventoried Baggage_ "), which, in
the alternative and at the direction of Purchaser, may be retained by Manager
pursuant to the New Management Agreement Documents. Purchaser shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against
any Losses incurred, with respect to any theft, loss or damage to any
Inventoried Baggage from and after the time of such inventory, and any other
baggage, boxes or similar items left in the care of Purchaser. Seller shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees from and
against any Losses incurred, with respect to any theft, loss or damage to any
Inventoried Baggage prior to the time of such inventory, and any other
baggage, boxes or similar items left in the care of Seller. This _Section
11.3_ shall survive the Closing.

 



46 Section 11.4 _Proprietary Property_. After the Closing, the Proprietary
Property and any other supplies and other personal property located at the
Hotel, or any signs and fixtures identifying the Hotel, that bear any of the
Protected Marks or Protected Names, shall (except for items that are damaged
or obsolete and have been or will be replaced immediately pursuant to the
terms of the New Management Agreement Documents) continue to be utilized by
the Hotel pursuant to and subject to the terms of the applicable New
Management Agreement Documents. This _Section 11.4_ shall survive the
Closing.

ARTICLE XII

 

DEFAULT; FAILURE OF CLOSING CONDITIONS

 

Section 12.1 _Seller s Default_. If (i) at any time prior to the Closing,
Seller is in breach or default of any of its covenants or obligations under
this Agreement that results in, or is reasonably expected to result in, a
material adverse effect on the value of, title to or use, or operation of a
Property, which default is not caused by a Purchaser Default (a " _Seller
Default_ "), or (ii) at the Closing, Seller has not satisfied the Purchaser
Closing Conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)_ or _8.2(c)_ , and Seller has
not cured such Seller Default or Purchaser Closing Condition failure within
ten (10) days after Sellers receipt of written notice of such Seller Default
or Purchase Closing Condition failure from Purchaser, then Purchaser, as its
sole and exclusive remedies for such Seller Default, may elect to (i)
terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable Property affected by
such Seller Default, in which case (A) Escrow Agent shall refund the Earnest
Money with respect to the affected Property to Purchaser upon Purchasers
satisfaction of its obligations under _Sections 4.1(c)_ , _4.1(d)_ and
_7.1(b)_ , (B) in the event of a willful and intentional Seller Default,
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for Purchasers out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement,
including legal fees and due diligence costs, not to exceed $250,000 in the
aggregate, and (C) thereafter Seller and Purchaser shall have no further
rights or obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Property,
except those which expressly survive such termination; (ii) proceed to the
Closing without any reduction in or setoff against the Purchase Price; or
(iii) bring an action for specific performance; provided, however that any
such action for specific performance shall be commenced no later than sixty
(60) days after the date Purchaser becomes aware of the applicable Seller
Default. If such action for specific performance is not timely commenced,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to bring an action for
specific performance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser elects to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12._1 with respect to the
applicable Property pursuant to this Section 12.1, Seller shall have the
right, within ten (10) days of Purchasers election to terminate, to elect to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the other
Properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not have the right to
terminate with respect to the other Properties in connection with a
termination right under this Section 12.1 if the Seller Default or failure of
a closing condition only affected the Property for which Closing was
terminated by Purchaser and Purchasers right of specific performance was not
an enforceable remedy for such Seller Default or failure of a closing
condition. If Seller fails, or is not permitted under this Agreement, to
elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to all of the Properties,
Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to Closing with
respect to the unaffected Properties.

 

Section 12.2 _Purchaser s Default_. If (i) Purchaser has not deposited the
Earnest Money within the time period provided in _Section 3.3(a)_, (ii) at
any time prior to the Closing, Purchaser is in material breach or default of
its covenants or obligations under this Agreement, which breach or default is
not caused by a Seller Default, or (iii) at the Closing, Purchaser has not
satisfied any one or more Seller Closing Conditions to be satisfied by
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing (each, a " _Purchaser Default_ "), and
Purchaser has not cured such Purchaser Default within ten (10) days after
Purchasers receipt of

 



47  written notice of such Purchaser Default from Seller, then Seller, as its
sole and exclusive remedies, may elect to terminate this Agreement by
providing written notice to Purchaser, in which case Purchaser shall cause
Escrow Agent to disburse the Earnest Money to Seller within two (2) Business
Days after such termination, and Seller and Purchaser shall have no further
rights or obligations under this Agreement, except those which expressly
survive such termination. Purchasers obligation to cause Escrow Agent to
disburse the Earnest Money to Seller shall survive such termination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have the right to elect terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 12.2_ with respect to the
applicable Property affected by such Purchaser Default or with respect to all
Properties upon such Purchaser Default.

48 SELLER AND PURCHASER AGREE THAT IF THIS AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED PURSUANT TO
THIS _SECTION 12.2_ , THE DAMAGES THAT SELLER WOULD SUSTAIN AS A RESULT OF
SUCH TERMINATION WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN.
ACCORDINGLY, SELLER AND PURCHASER AGREE THAT SELLER SHALL RETAIN THE EARNEST
MONEY AS FULL AND COMPLETE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND AS SELLERS SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR SUCH TERMINATION; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SELLER SHALL
RETAIN ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THOSE
OBLIGATIONS WHICH EXPRESSLY SURVIVE SUCH TERMINATION. THE PAYMENT OF SUCH
AMOUNT AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WITHIN THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE
SECTIONS 3275 OR 3389), BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO
SELLER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE
SECTIONS 1671, 1676 AND 1677). IN FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THEIR AGREEMENT TO THIS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION, SELLER AND PURCHASER HAVE INITIALED BELOW:

CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION

Section 13.1 _Casualty_.

 

(a) _Material Casualty_. If the Property or any portion thereof is damaged or
destroyed by fire or any other casualty prior to the Closing (a " _Casualty_
"), Seller shall give written notice of such Casualty to Purchaser promptly
after the occurrence of such Casualty. If the amount of the repair,
restoration or replacement required by a Casualty equals or exceeds
ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price with respect to the applicable
Property (a " _Material Casualty_ ") and the Casualty was not caused by
Purchaser or Purchasers Inspectors, or their respective employees or agents,
then Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) terminate
this Agreement with respect to the applicable Property affected by such
Material Casualty, in which case Escrow Agent shall refund the Earnest Money
with respect to the affected Property to Purchaser upon Purchasers
satisfaction of its obligations under _Sections 4.1(c)_ , _4.1(d)_ and
_7.1(b)_ and Seller and Purchaser shall have no further rights or obligations
under this Agreement with respect to such Property, except those which
expressly survive such termination, or (ii) proceed to the Closing, without
terminating this Agreement, in which case Seller shall (A) credit the amount
of the applicable insurance deductible against the Purchase Price, and (B)
transfer and assign to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in
and to all proceeds from all casualty and lost profits insurance policies
maintained by Seller with respect to the Hotel, except those proceeds
allocable to lost profits for the period prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall
make an election under this _Section 13.1(a)_ by giving written notice to
Seller on or before ten (10) Business Days after Sellers delivery to
Purchaser of written notice of such Casualty. If Purchaser fails to make an
election under this _Section 13.1(a)_ within such time period, Purchaser
shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to the
Closing pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of this _Section 13.1(a)_. If the Closing
Date is scheduled to occur within Purchasers ten (10) day election period,
the Closing Date shall be extended until the tenth (10th) day after the
expiration of such ten (10) Business Day election period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Purchaser elects to terminate this Agreement under this 
_Section 13.1(a)_ with respect to the applicable Property affected by such
Material Casualty, Seller shall have the right, within ten (10) days of
Purchasers election to terminate, to elect to terminate this Agreement
with respect to the other Properties. If Seller fails to make an election
within such time period, Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have elected
to proceed to Closing with respect to the unaffected Properties.

 



49 (b) _Non-Material Casualty_. In the event of any (i) Casualty which is not a
Material Casualty, or (ii) Material Casualty which is caused by Purchaser or
Purchasers Inspectors, or their respective employees or agents, then
Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement, but shall
proceed to the Closing, in which case Seller shall (A) credit the amount of
the applicable insurance deductible against the Purchase Price (except if such
Casualty is caused by Purchaser or Purchasers Inspectors), and (B) transfer
and assign to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to
all proceeds from all casualty and lost profits insurance policies maintained
by Seller with respect to the Hotel, except those proceeds allocable to lost
profits for the period prior to the Closing.

Section 13.2 _Condemnation_.

 

(a) _Material Condemnation_. If the event of any actual or threatened
condemnation or taking pursuant to the power of eminent domain of all or any
portion of the Real Property, or any proposed sale in lieu thereof (a "
_Condemnation_ "), Seller shall give written notice of such Condemnation to
Purchaser as soon as possible after Seller receives notice of
such Condemnation. If the Condemnation would (i) result in the loss of more
than ten percent (10%) of the Land or Improvements (computed on a square foot
basis) of the applicable Property or (ii) result in any material reduction
or restriction in access to the Land or Improvements of the applicable
Property (a " _Material Condemnation_ "), then Purchaser shall have the right,
in its sole discretion, to (A) terminate this Agreement with respect to
the applicable Property affected by such Material Condemnation, in which case
Escrow Agent shall refund the Earnest Money with respect to the affected
Property to Purchaser upon Purchasers satisfaction of its obligations under
_Sections 4.1(c)_ , _4.1(d)_ and _7.1(b)_ and Seller and Purchaser shall have
no further rights or obligations under this Agreement with respect to such
Property, except those which expressly survive such termination, or (B)
proceed to the Closing, without terminating this Agreement, in which case
Seller shall assign to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in
all proceeds and awards from such Condemnation. Purchaser shall make an
election under this  _Section 13.2(a)_ by giving written notice to Seller
within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers delivery to Purchaser of written
notice of such Condemnation. If Purchaser fails to make an election under
this  _Section 13.2(a)_ within such time period, Purchaser shall be
conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to the Closing pursuant to
_clause (B)_ of this _Section 13.2(a)_. If the Closing Date is scheduled to
occur within Purchasers ten (10) Business Day election period, the Closing
Date shall be extended until the tenth (10th) day after the expiration of such
ten (10) day election period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser
elects to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 13.2(a)_ with respect
to the applicable Property affected by such Material Condemnation, Seller
shall have the right, within ten (10) days of Purchasers election to
terminate, to elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to the other
Properties. If Seller fails to make an election within such time period,
Seller shall be conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed to Closing
with respect to the unaffected Properties.

(b) _Non-Material Condemnation_. In the event of any Condemnation of any Real
Property other than a Material Condemnation, Purchaser shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement, but shall proceed to the Closing, in which
case Seller shall assign to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and
interest in all proceeds and awards from such Condemnation.

delivery is made prior to 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on a Business Day,
otherwise the following Business Day, or (ii) the attempted delivery of such

Section 14.3 _Assignment_. Purchaser shall not assign this Agreement or any
interest therein to any Person, without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser may assign the right to receive each Property at Closing
under this Agreement to one or more Affiliates without Sellers consent,
provided such Affiliate shall assume in writing all of the obligations of
Purchaser hereunder with respect to such Property (and Purchaser shall not be
released from liability hereunder). No assignment of this Agreement
by Purchaser shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

Section 14.4 _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This

Indemnitee to the extent such Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee is
expressly granted certain rights of defense and indemnification in this
Agreement and for any successors and permitted assigns pursuant to _Sections
3.5_ and  _14.3_ , this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies
upon any third party.

Section 14.5 _Prevailing Party_. If any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is sought, taken, instituted or
brought by Seller or Purchaser to enforce its rights under this Agreement, all
fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees and court costs, of the prevailing Party in such action, suit
or proceeding shall be borne by the Party against whose interest the judgment
or decision is rendered. This _Section 14.5_ shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and the Closing.

other notice of this Agreement, shall be recorded without Sellers prior
written consent, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion.
