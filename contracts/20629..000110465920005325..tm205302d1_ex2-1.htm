This Agreement and Plan of Merger (together with the Disclosure Letters and
Exhibits hereto, this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of the 20th day of January,
2020, by and among CSS Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), IG Design Group Americas, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("
_Parent_ "), TOM MERGER SUB INC., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and IG Design Group Plc, a
public limited company incorporated and registered in England and Wales ("
_TopCo Parent_ "). Each of TopCo Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company is sometimes referred to herein individually as a " _Party_ " and
collectively they are sometimes referred to herein as the " _Parties_."

  



  

 _RECITALS_

  



  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub has agreed to commence, and Parent has agreed to cause
Merger Sub to commence, the Offer to purchase all of the shares of
Company Common Stock at a price per share of Company Common Stock equal to
the Offer Price;

  



  

WHEREAS, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, the
Parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the merger as the surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ")
and each share of Company Common Stock outstanding that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than shares of Company Common Stock
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, the Company or Merger Sub, will be
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price
(with the Merger being governed by Section 251(h) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "));

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub (i) has approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, including the
Merger and the Offer, and (ii) has resolved to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and TopCo Parent have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including the Merger and the Offer, and Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved the Offer
and the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") (i)
has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, including the Merger and the Offer, and (ii) has resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender
their shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "), into the Offer; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has determined and resolved that it is in the best
interest of the Company and its stockholders to amend that certain
Rights Agreement, dated as of November 11, 2019, by and between the Company
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Rights Agreement_ "), to provide
that the approval, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, will not
result in the grant of any rights under the Rights Agreement to become
exercisable.

  



   



 



    

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I

  



  

 _DEFINED TERMS_

  



  

Section 1.01   _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement have the meanings specified in the body of this Agreement or
otherwise as specified in _Exhibit A_.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

  



  

Section 2.01   _The Offer_.

  



  

(a)  Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_ , as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence,
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, a tender offer (the
" _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock at a price per share equal to $9.40 net to seller in cash, without
interest (such amount or any higher amount per share of Company Common Stock
paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer
Price_ "), subject to any deduction or withholding of Taxes in accordance
with _Section 3.01(h)_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of
Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, shall be
subject only to: (i) there being validly tendered and "received" (as defined
by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time that number of shares of Company
Common Stock (excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures but not yet delivered) that, together with the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective "affiliates" (as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the
DGCL), represents fifty-one percent (51%) of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), (ii) this Agreement not
having been validly terminated in accordance with its terms (the "
_Termination Condition_ ") and (iii) the satisfaction, or waiver (to the
extent such waiver is permitted by Applicable Law and this Agreement) by
Parent or Merger Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in
_Exhibit B_ (together with the Minimum Condition and the Termination
Condition, the " _Offer Conditions "_).

  



  

(b)  Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, of the Offer Conditions, Merger
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (i) at or as promptly as
practicable following the Expiration Time (in any event, no later than the
second Business Day immediately following the date on which the Expiration
Time occurs), accept for payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) at or as promptly as practicable following the
Expiration Time (in any event, no later than the third Business Day
immediately following the date on which the Expiration Time occurs), pay the
aggregate Offer Price (by delivery of funds to the depositary for the Offer)
for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. The Parties agree that the Offer and Merger
Sub's obligation to accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
in accordance with the foregoing are not, and shall not be, subject to any
condition other than the Offer Conditions.

(c)  The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "
_Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer
in accordance with this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to (i) increase the
Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Conditions (other than the
Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition and the Antitrust Condition) and
(iii) make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(unless otherwise provided by this Agreement) without the prior written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub not to) (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the
Termination Condition, the Minimum Condition or the Antitrust Condition, (iv)
add to the conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ or modify or change any Offer
Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to any holders of
Company Common Stock of the Company, (v) except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 2.01_ , extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer,
(vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise
amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse
in any material respect to any holders of Company Common Stock of the Company.

  



  

(d)  Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is
twenty (20) business days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (such time, the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ "), or if the Initial Expiration Time has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, on the date to which the Offer has been so
extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later time and date to which
the Initial Expiration Time has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

(e)  Parent and Merger Sub agree that, if as of any scheduled
Expiration Time, any of the Offer Conditions is not satisfied (other than the
condition set forth in clause (b)(v) of _Exhibit B_ , which by its nature is
to be satisfied at the Expiration Time) or, in Merger Sub's sole discretion,
waived (if such Offer Condition is permitted to be waived pursuant to this
Agreement and Applicable Law), then Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of time of up to five
(5) business days each (for this purpose, calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (or such longer period as the Parties may
agree in writing) in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions;
_provided _ that, if at any scheduled Expiration Time, the only unsatisfied
Offer Condition (other than the condition set forth in clause (b)(v) of
_Exhibit B_ , which by its nature is to be satisfied at the Expiration Time)
is the Minimum Condition, (i) Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer for more than a total of twenty (20) business days (for this purpose,
calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) and
(ii) if prior to any scheduled Expiration Time on or after such twentieth
(20th) business day referred to in the foregoing clause (i) of this proviso,
Merger Sub has received from the Company a written notice of the Company's
election that Merger Sub not so extend the Offer, Merger Sub shall not
(and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to) extend the Offer beyond such
scheduled Expiration Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, (A) Merger Sub shall not be required to, and without the Company's
prior written consent shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to),
extend the Offer to a date later than the Termination Date, (B) Merger Sub
shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to) extend the Offer if all
Offer Conditions have been satisfied and (C) Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer for any period or periods required by Applicable Law, including
applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the SEC or its
staff, or the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) Merger Sub may from time to time, in
its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer on
up to three (3) separate occasions for ten (10) business days each (for this
purpose, calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act), if, as of any scheduled Expiration Time, (x) Parent and Merger Sub shall
have waived the Funding Condition, (y) all of the other Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in
clause (b)(v) of _Exhibit B_ , which by its nature is to be satisfied at the
Expiration Time) have been satisfied or, in Merger Sub's sole discretion,
waived (to the extent such Offer Condition is permitted to be waived pursuant
to this Agreement and Applicable Law) at such time and (z) the proceeds of
the Financing have not actually been received by Merger Sub or TopCo Parent
(either directly or through any of TopCo Parent's Subsidiaries) and the
Financing Sources have not unconditionally and irrevocably confirmed in
writing to TopCo Parent, Parent or Merger Sub that all of the Financing will
be available at the Offer Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Financing Letters, and (2) if the Funding Condition has been satisfied or
waived by Parent and Merger Sub, then Merger Sub shall, if required by the
Exchange Act, cause the Offer to be extended for a period of five (5)
business days (for this purpose, calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act).

  



  

(f)  Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not
to) terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the
prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Article IX._  If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to _Article IX_ , Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) promptly (and in any event within one (1) business day) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is validly terminated
prior to the Acceptance Time, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Merger Sub to return, in accordance with Applicable Law, all tendered shares
of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(g)  Parent shall cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, all of the funds necessary to purchase all shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and
shall cause Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of Merger Sub's
obligations under this Agreement.

(h)  As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the
Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include as exhibits
(without limitation) the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a
form of summary advertisement and a form of notice of guaranteed delivery
(the Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the
Offer shall be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto,
being referred to herein as the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company and its
Affiliates required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer
Documents. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by all Applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act.
If, prior to the Acceptance Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent, or any change occurs with respect to other
information included by Parent in the Offer Documents (other than information
supplied by the Company for inclusion therein), on the one hand, or any event
occurs with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any
change occurs with respect to other information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Offer Documents, on the other hand, upon becoming aware of
such information Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall promptly notify
the other of such event and shall cooperate with the other to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by Applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent shall promptly notify the Company
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents and shall provide the Company
with copies of all correspondence between Parent and its respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent shall (i) provide the Company
with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and (ii)
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the Company.
Parent and Merger Sub shall also take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Exchange Act or any
applicable foreign or state securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder in connection with the Offer and the Merger.

  



  

(i)  For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer, unless agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub, any shares of Company Common Stock subject to notices
of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the
Offer unless and until the shares underlying such notices of guaranteed
delivery are delivered to Merger Sub.

Section 2.02   _Company Actions_.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the
Merger, the Contemplated Transactions and each of the Offer Documents. The
Company has been advised that all of its directors and named executive
officers (as that term is defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the
Securities Act) who own shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect to any
conversion or exercise of other Company securities into shares of Company
Common Stock) intend to tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common Stock held
by the Company (other than any such shares held on behalf of third parties,
if any) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

  



  

(b) The Company shall file on the date of the commencement of the
Offer with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall contain the Company Board
Recommendation and the notice and other information required by Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that such document shall not
be required to include the Company Board Recommendation if the Company Board
shall have made a Change in the Company Board Recommendation in accordance
with _Section 7.01(d)_. Parent shall promptly furnish all information
concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the Company as required by the
Exchange Act or Applicable Law to be included therein. The Company shall
promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by all Applicable Laws,
including the Exchange Act, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as
the record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d)(2) of the DGCL. If, prior to the Acceptance Time, any event occurs
with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any change
occurs with respect to other information included by the Company in the
Schedule 14D-9 (other than information supplied by Parent for inclusion
therein), on the one hand, or any event occurs with respect to Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9, on the other hand,
upon becoming aware of such information the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall promptly notify the other of such event and shall cooperate with the
other in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 and, as required by Applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
the Company's stockholders. So long as the Company Board has not made a Change
in the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section 7.01(d)_,
the Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Schedule 14D-9 and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on
the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the
Company Board has not made a Change in the Company Board Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 7.01(d)_, prior to filing or mailing the Schedule
14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments
of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i) provide Parent with an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) consider in good
faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) not file or mail
such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval
of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Without limiting the foregoing, so long as the Company Board has
not made a Change in the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 7.01(d)_, Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall have the right
to participate with the Company or its counsel regarding any discussions or
meetings with the SEC related to the Offer, the Merger or the other
Contemplated Transactions to the extent such participation is not prohibited
by the SEC.

(c)  The Company shall promptly after the date hereof, and from time
to time as reasonably requested by Merger Sub or its agents, furnish or cause
to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels, security position listings, non-
objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
available to it containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such information (including, but not
limited to, updated lists of holders of Company Common Stock and their
addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Merger Sub or its agents
may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
holders of Company Common Stock, in connection with the preparation and
dissemination of the Offer Documents and the solicitation of tenders of
shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer (the date of the list used to
determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are
first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Parent and Merger Sub
and their respective Representatives shall hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with such transactions and, if this Agreement is
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and cause their agents to deliver,
to the Company all copies, summaries and abstracts of such information then
in their actual possession.

  



  

(d)  The Company shall instruct its transfer agent to register the
transfer of shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment effective
immediately after the Acceptance Time.

  



  

Section 2.03   _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible under Applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, at the Merger Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, at the Merger
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Closing; Merger Effective Time_. Subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, immediately following the Acceptance Time (the 
" _Offer Closing_ "), the Parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective immediately following the
Offer Closing, without a meeting of the stockholders of the Company, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, including filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger (or
such later time as may be agreed by each of the Parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger) (the " _Merger Effective Time_ "). Immediately prior
to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the  " _Closing_ ")
shall be held at the offices of Seyfarth Shaw LLP, 1075 Peachtree Street, NE,
Suite 2500, Atlanta, GA 30309, or such other place as the Parties shall
agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or waiver, as the case
may be, of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall be
governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL and effected at the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that, if, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger is not
permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL for any
reason, then the Parties shall take all reasonable actions necessary to cause
the consummation of the Merger as promptly as practicable after the Offer
Closing.

Section 2.05   _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL.

by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of the Company or Merger
Sub:

  



  

(a)  All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned, directly or

immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.06(a)_, (ii) as expressly set forth
in _Section 3.02_ and (iii) subject to the provisions of _Section 2.10_)
shall, at the Merger Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") less
any withholding in accordance with _Section 3.01(h)_.

  



  

(c)  As of the Merger Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this _Section 2.06_ shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry
form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and as provided
by the Agreement or Applicable Law.

  



  

(d)  At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of securities of the Company or Merger Sub, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.07   _Charter and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

(a)  The certificate of incorporation of the Company immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of Company Common Stock, amended and restated in its entirety as set
forth in _Exhibit C_ hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with such certificate of incorporation and Applicable
Law.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b)  The bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company Common
Stock, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended
in accordance with such bylaws and Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.08   _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until such director's
or officer's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

Section 2.09   _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of (i) the Merger Effective Time or (ii) any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ , the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the
Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Stock
Options exercisable for Company Common Stock) the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section
2.09_ shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.10   _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
(" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.06_, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of
the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's
Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted as of the Merger Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.06_. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to Section 262 received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

Section 2.11 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
  _DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF EQUITY AWARDS_

  



  

Section 3.01   _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall enter into a customary paying agent agreement with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and shall deposit with
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the Merger Consideration
(such cash provided to the Paying Agent, hereinafter referred to as the "
_Merger Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to
be issued pursuant to _Section 2.06_ out of the Merger Fund. Except as
provided in _Section 3.01(g)_, the Merger Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

  



  

(b)   _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i)   _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to
mail, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger Effective Time and
in any event not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date,
to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to  _Section 2.06_, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as
promptly as practicable, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect
thereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(ii)   _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled
to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.06_ shall automatically upon the Merger Effective Time be entitled
to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver the
aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof as promptly as practicable
after the Merger Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any
cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

  



  

(c)  The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately,
in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. After the Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time. If, after the Merger Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

  



  

(d)  Any portion of the Merger Fund (including proceeds of any
investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of
Company Common Stock on the sixth-month anniversary of the Merger Effective
Time shall, subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e)  None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)  In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(g)  The Paying Agent shall invest the Merger Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or gain or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this _Article III_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the
Merger Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Merger Fund in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment
obligations.

  



  

(h)  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any former holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of Applicable
Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 3.01(h)_ and
paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all
amounts so deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the
period required under Applicable Law.

  



  

Section 3.02   _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Cash
Awards_. Except as otherwise agreed upon by the holder and Parent in writing,
the following treatment shall apply to the Company's equity compensation and
cash awards:

  



  

(a)   _Company Stock Options_. At the Merger Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled, and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to
receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect
thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Company Stock Option as of immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time, less any applicable Taxes required to be
withheld as provided in _Section 3.01(h)_, which amount shall be payable in
accordance with the Company's standard payroll procedures as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Merger Effective Time. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the exercise price per share of a Company Stock Option exceeds
the Offer Price, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled at the Merger
Effective Time without payment of any consideration.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(b)   _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Merger Effective Time, each
share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of restrictions
and any repurchase rights applicable thereto shall lapse, and the holder
thereof shall then become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the
rights of such holder with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the
Offer Price, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld as provided in
_Section 3.01(h)_, which amount shall be payable in accordance with the
Company's standard payroll procedures as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(c)   _Company RSUs_. At the Merger Effective Time, each Company RSU
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall vest
in full and become free of restrictions and any repurchase rights applicable
thereto shall lapse, and the holder of such Company RSU (whether vested prior
to the Merger Effective Time or as a result thereof) shall then become
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Offer
Price, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time,
less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld as provided in _Section
3.01(h)_, which amount shall be payable in accordance with the Company's
standard payroll procedures as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 3.02(c)_, if required to comply with
Section 409A of the Code, such amount shall be paid on the settlement date for
such Company RSU specified under the terms of the applicable award agreement.

  



  

(d)   _Company PSUs_. At the Merger Effective Time, each Company PSU
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be
canceled, and the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive, in
full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Offer Price, multiplied by (ii)
the PSU Amount, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld as provided
in _Section 3.01(h)_, which amount shall be payable in accordance with the
Company's standard payroll procedures as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.02(d)_, if required to comply
with Section 409A of the Code, such amount shall be paid on the settlement
date for such Company PSU specified under the terms of the applicable award
agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _PSU Amount_ " means, with
respect to any Company PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the target number of units subject to the Company PSU.

  



  

(e)   _Company Actions_. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, and in any event prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company and
the Company Board (or applicable committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions to
(i) terminate the Company Stock Plans on the Closing Date; and (ii)
effectuate treatment of the Company's equity compensation awards, as
contemplated by this _Section 3.02_, and ensure that, after the Merger
Effective Time, (A) no former or current holder of a Company equity
compensation award or cash award or any current or former participant in any
Company Stock Plan or Company Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, TopCo Parent or
Parent and (B) no holder of a Company equity compensation award or cash award
shall have any right to receive any payment or benefit with respect to such
Company equity compensation award or cash award, except as provided in this
_Section 3.02_; provided that no such action shall terminate, cancel or
otherwise affect any restrictive covenant binding on the holder of any
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Stock, Company RSU, and/or Company
PSU that is contained in the Company Stock Plans or the corresponding award
agreement(s), to the extent such restrictive covenant would otherwise survive
such action.

material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their
respective dates.

(b) The Company has timely filed all certifications and statements
required by (i) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (ii) 18
U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) with respect to
all applicable Company SEC Documents. The Company's "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) are designed to provide assurances that all information (both financial
and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company (or
persons acting in such capacities) required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date
of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board and made available to Parent a summary of (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any material
respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of
this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness"
shall have the meaning assigned to them by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. Since March 31, 2019, (i) neither the Company nor, to
the Company's knowledge, any director, officer, employee with responsibility
for bookkeeping or accounting functions, auditor, accountant, or
Representative of the Company has received notice of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion of claim, whether written or oral, regarding accounting
or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company's
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company has
reported evidence of a material violation of Applicable Law, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of the Company. As used in this _Section
4.07(b)_, the term "filed" shall be broadly construed to include any manner
in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC.

  



  

(c)  The Company has established and maintains a system of
"internal controls over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that is sufficient in all material respects
to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and the Company Board, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that would have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements, including exposing the Company to violations
of anti-corruption laws as enforced by the SEC, whether or not material,
including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the Travel Act. To
the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor the Company's auditors
have identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" in the
design or operation of such internal controls that would reasonably be
expected to be adverse in any material respect to the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information. No significant
deficiency, material weakness or fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees was identified in management's
assessment of internal controls as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2019 (nor has any such deficiency, weakness or fraud been identified to the
Company's auditors, senior management of the Company and/or the Company Board
since such date).

Liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be disclosed on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in the notes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than Liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business or Liabilities that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

obsolete, damaged, defective or slow-moving items that have been written off

established, and (ii) the quantities of each item of inventory are not
excessive, but are reasonable in the present circumstances of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f)  The Company is not a party to, nor has any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand,
and any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material Liabilities of, the Company in the Company's published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

  



  

(g)  Each of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each person acting in such capacity or
each former principal executive officer and each former principal financial
officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required
by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") with respect to
the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Company does not have outstanding (nor has arranged or
modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of the Company. The Company is otherwise in compliance with all
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing
and corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange except for any
non-compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.08   _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since March 31, 2019,
(i) there has not occurred any Company Material Adverse Effect or any event,
condition, change, or effect that could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
except as contemplated by or permitted under this Agreement, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice in all material respects and (iii) except as set
forth in _Section 4.08(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there has not
been any event, condition, action, or effect that, if taken during the period

forth in _Section 4.09_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is
no Proceeding by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation by the Company of the

when filed with the SEC, or when distributed or disseminated to the Company's

paid on or prior to the Closing Date.

Financing Letters, (2) the borrowing of money nor granting of Liens under the
Financing, or (3) any action (including any internal reorganization,
designation of Subsidiaries as "unrestricted subsidiaries," any investment in
any Subsidiary or unrestricted Subsidiary and any restricted payment necessary
to have cash available to pay the Merger Amounts and consummate the
Contemplated Transactions), in each case, that is required to satisfy
the conditions precedent under the Financing Letters conflicts with,
constitutes a default under or requires consent of any Person under any
credit agreement, note purchase agreement, indenture or other Contract with
respect to indebtedness for borrowed money to which TopCo Parent or any
Subsidiary of TopCo Parent is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound, except to the extent required by the

ARTICLE VII

  



  

 _COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

  



  

Section 7.01   _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, and that it will instruct and cause its Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other
action to knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer (including any proposal or offer to the Company's stockholders), with
respect to any Competing Company Transaction, (ii) enter into, maintain,
continue or otherwise engage or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain
a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing Company Transaction, (iii)
agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any Competing Company
Transaction, (iv) enter into any Competing Company Transaction Agreement or
(v) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any Representative, to
do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall instruct and cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) conducted prior to the
execution of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives with respect to a Competing Company Transaction. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall
instruct and cause its Representatives not to, release any third party from,
or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with a Competing
Company Transaction, unless the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with outside legal
counsel, that failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company or its stockholders
under Applicable Law. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
promptly request each Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Person's consideration of a Competing
Company Transaction (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or
otherwise), to return (or if permitted by the applicable confidentiality
agreement, destroy) all information required to be returned (or, if
applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of the applicable
confidentiality agreement and, if requested by Parent, to seek to enforce
such Person's obligation to do so.

  



  

(b)  The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours after the Company attains knowledge thereof) notify Parent, orally
and in writing, after the receipt by the Company or any of its Representatives
of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) with
respect to a Competing Company Transaction, including any request for
discussions or negotiations and any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Affiliates or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Affiliates. Such notice
shall indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry,
offer or request and a description of such proposal, inquiry, offer or
request, including in reasonable detail the terms and conditions (if any) of
such proposed Competing Company Transaction, and the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by the Company)
provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the Company in
connection with any of the foregoing. The Company agrees that it shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and details of (including
discussions with respect thereto or amendments to) any such proposal, inquiry,
offer or request. The Company agrees that it shall substantially
simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company that may be made available pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_ to any
other Person in response to any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request
(including discussions with respect thereto or any amendment to) unless such
information has previously been provided or made available by the Company to
Parent.

  



  

   

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.01_,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may furnish information
to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with, any Person (or any of
such Person's Representatives) who has made a written, bona fide proposal or
offer with respect to a Competing Company Transaction that did not arise
or result from any material breach of _Section 7.01(a)_ if, prior to
furnishing such information and entering into such discussions and
negotiations, (A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined,
in its good faith judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), that such
proposal or offer constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, (B) the Company has provided written notice to Parent of its intent
to furnish information to, and enter into discussions and negotiations
with, such Person and (C) the Company has obtained (to the extent not already
obtained) from such Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any related
agreements shall not include any provision granting such Person exclusive
rights to negotiate with the Company or having the effect of prohibiting the
Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement) and, promptly
upon its execution, delivered to Parent a copy of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(d)  Except as set forth in this _Section 7.01(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify,
amend or fail to make, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation (or fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9), (ii) make any public statement or take
any action inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation or (iii)
approve or adopt, or recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly
propose to approve or adopt, any Competing Company Transaction (any of the
actions described in (i), (ii) or (iii), a  " _Change in the Company Board
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(i)  in response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Offer Closing, the Company Board may
effect a Change in the Company Board Recommendation if: (x) prior to effecting
the Change in the Company Board Recommendation, the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing, at least five (5) Business Days (the " _Intervening
Event Notice Period_ ") before taking such action of its intent to consider
such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Change in the
Company Board Recommendation), and which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons
for taking, such action; (y) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to, and the
reasons for taking such action, ceases to constitute an Intervening Event, if
Parent, in its sole discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being
agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Intervening Event
Notice Period, there is any material development in an Intervening Event, the
Intervening Event Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure
that at least three (3) Business Days remains in the Intervening Event
Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such
material development (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions)); and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that the failure to effect such Change in the Company
Board Recommendation, after taking into account any adjustments made by
Parent during the Intervening Event Notice Period, would be inconsistent
with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company or its stockholders
under Applicable Law; and

  



  

   

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time and in response to the
receipt of an offer or proposal with respect to a Competing Company
Transaction that did not arise or result from any material breach of _Section
7.01(a)_, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in its good
faith judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that such offer or proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and determines in its good faith judgment,
after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a
Change in the Company Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to
the Company or its stockholders under Applicable Law, then the Company Board
may, with respect to such Superior Proposal, (x) make a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(f) _in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal if, in each case:

  



  

(1)  the Company has provided written notice to Parent (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal promptly after the Company Board determines it
has received a Superior Proposal, stating that the Company Board intends to
make a Change in the Company Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(f)_ and describing in reasonable detail the terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the offer or
proposal that constitutes the Superior Proposal; and

  



  

(2)  Parent does not, within five (5) Business Days of receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make a written
offer or proposal to revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "
_Revised Transaction Proposal_ ") in a manner that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel, to be at least as favorable to the Company's stockholders as
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that, during the Notice
Period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised Transaction Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any amendment to the material terms of such
Superior Proposal during the Notice Period shall require a new written
notice of the terms of such amended Superior Proposal from the Company and an
additional two (2) Business Day Notice Period, including with respect to the
Company's obligations to negotiate in good faith with Parent.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its
outside legal counsel, that a failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company or its
stockholders under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) in no
event shall this _Section 7.01(e)_ affect the obligations specified in
_Section 7.01(d)_ and (2) any such disclosure (other than issuance by
the Company of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board with respect to this Agreement or a Competing Company
Transaction shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company
Board Recommendation unless the Company Board in connection with such
communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this
Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Company
Board, without disclosing any Change in the Company Board Recommendation.

Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (i)
afford Parent and TopCo Parent and their authorized Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties and books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to the authorized
Representatives of Parent and TopCo Parent such additional available
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (or copies thereof),
as Parent may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_  that (x) any
such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted during normal
business hours in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y) neither TopCo
Parent nor Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives not
to, contact any of the customers, distributors or suppliers of any
Company Entity, other than any such customers, distributors or suppliers that
are also customers, distributors or suppliers of Parent or TopCo Parent, in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, whether in person or by
telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the specific prior
written authorization of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or
disclose any information to Parent and TopCo Parent or their
respective Representatives if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to
(A) jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-client or
other legal privilege or (B) contravene any Applicable Law or fiduciary duty;
_provided_ that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it
is withholding such access or information pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) of
this _Section 7.02_ and thereafter Parent and the Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such access or
information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize such privilege or
contravene such Applicable Law or fiduciary duty. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent, TopCo Parent nor any of their
respective Representatives shall be allowed to sample or analyze any soil or
groundwater or other environmental media, or any building material, without
the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

Section 7.03   _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company (the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_") as provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or any indemnification Contract between such directors
or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on, and, in the case
of any indemnification Contracts, to the extent made available to
Parent prior to, the date hereof) shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Merger
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws of the Company or any indemnification Contract as in
effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Merger Effective Time and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Parties;
_provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for
indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such action or resolution of such claim.

(b)  Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or
after the Merger Effective Time to, purchase a six (6) year prepaid "tail"
policy, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable to the insured persons than the coverage provided under the
Company's existing policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect to matters arising on or
before the Merger Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions), and Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_
that in no event shall the Company pay, or the Surviving Corporation be
required to pay, with respect to such insurance policies, more than 250% of
the most recent annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
prior to, as of or after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, for a
period of six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time, cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company with respect to matters arising on or before the Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ that Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay premiums in
accordance with the foregoing sentence shall not require it to pay annual
premiums in excess of the Maximum Amount.

  



  

(c)  The covenants contained in this _Section 7.03_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to
Applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

(d)  In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.03_.

  



  

Section 7.04   _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and
Consents_.

  



  

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with the other
Parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals and (iii) provide such other information to any
Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may reasonably
request in connection herewith. Each Party agrees to, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, make promptly its respective legally applicable
filing (or draft filing if required by the applicable Governmental Authority),
but in no event more than seven (7) Business Days following the date hereof,
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws under which filing
is required or under which the Parties reasonably mutually determine that
filing is advisable with respect to the Contemplated Transactions and to
supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws. Parent shall
be responsible for all HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws filing fees.

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the undertakings of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 7.04(a)_, and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable
the Parties to close the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable
(each, an " _Impediment_ "), and in any event prior to the Termination Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates to (x) propose, negotiate, commit to
and effect by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses
or (y) undertake any efforts or to take any action if the taking of such
efforts or action is or would reasonably be expected to result, individually
or in the aggregate, in a material and adverse effect on the assets,
Liabilities, business, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of (A) Parent, its Affiliates and its and their Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or of (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (each of such actions, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "), and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect
of, or agree with any Governmental Authority to, any Burdensome Condition
without the prior written consent of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
reasonable best efforts shall include the taking of any steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate an Impediment (other than any action that would constitute
or otherwise result in a Burdensome Condition). In addition, each Party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to
defend through litigation on the merits any Proceeding by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Termination Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be construed to require Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates to continue litigation beyond the
Termination Date or other termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_.

  



  

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any
substantive communication it or any of its Representatives receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the ability to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions and permit the other Parties to review in advance any proposed
substantive communication by such Party to any Governmental Authority. The
Party providing communications for review under the foregoing sentence shall
consider, in good faith, the suggestions made by the other Parties. None of
the Parties shall agree to participate in any meeting or substantive
discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation (including any settlement of an investigation), litigation or
other inquiry relating to the Contemplated Transactions unless it consults
with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or substantive discussion. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate fully with
each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as
the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and
in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including
under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law. Each Party shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, provide each other with copies of
all substantive correspondence, filings or substantive communications between
them or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements or Applicable Law and (ii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a Party may designate information that it views
to be commercially sensitive or competitively sensitive to be viewed only by
outside antitrust counsel for the other Parties, and such designation shall
be honored by the Parties receiving that information.

(d)  Parent agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any
transaction (including any merger, acquisition or other business combination)
that could reasonably be expected to increase the time required, to (i)
obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, or under any other Applicable Law, in respect of
the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that could reasonably
be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary or reasonably
mutually determined as advisable for the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions.

  



  

Section 7.05   _Financing_.

  



  

(a)  Immediately following the date hereof, TopCo Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions

(b) TopCo Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to arrange and
obtain the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on or prior to the
Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Letters, including to: (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing
Letters and any Definitive Financing Agreements in accordance with their
terms until the funding of the Financing to TopCo Parent or one or more of its
Affiliates that are within its control on the Closing Date; (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the
Financing Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to TopCo
Parent or one or more of its Affiliates that are within its control; (iii)
negotiate and enter into additional definitive debt financing agreements to
the extent necessary (including the entrance into amended and/or restated
versions of already existing definitive debt facility agreements) on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Letters (the " _Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements_ ") and definitive equity financing agreements on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Equity Letters (the " _Definitive
Equity Financing Agreements_ " and together with the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "); and (iv)
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions, cause the
Financing Sources to consummate the Financing, and fund the amounts thereunder
on the Closing Date. TopCo Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed
on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof. TopCo Parent will
promptly provide to the Company copies of all Definitive Financing
Agreements. TopCo Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice after
the occurrence of any of the following: (A) any material breach or material
default by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of which TopCo Parent becomes aware; (B) the receipt
by TopCo Parent, Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or written
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to a
Financing Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing or of
any provisions of any Financing Letter or such definitive agreements; (C) any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreement with respect to the
conditionality or amount of the Financing or the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing (but
excluding ordinary course negotiations); (D) if for any reason, TopCo Parent,
Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; and (E) any fact,
change, event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters. In the event that all
conditions contained in the Financing Letters (other than, with respect to
the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing) have been
satisfied and Parent is required to consummate the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.04_ , TopCo Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each Financing Source to fund its respective portion of the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, TopCo Parent, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree to or permit any
termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or
waive any of its rights, provisions or remedies under, the Financing Letters
or Definitive Financing Agreements without the Company's prior
written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_
, that TopCo Parent, Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Company's prior
written consent, (i) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Debt Letters or
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably
be expected to, reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below an
amount, together with the Equity Financing, and any available cash of TopCo
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, required to pay
the Merger Amounts, or prevent, materially delay or impede the consummation
of the Offer, the Merger or the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Letters; and (ii) amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt
Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or
similar entities that had not executed the Debt Letters as of the date hereof
so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Letters, but only, with respect to the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent doing so would not (x) impose
new or additional conditions or expand, amend or modify any existing
condition to the receipt and availability of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede
the ability of Parent to consummate the Closing or (y) adversely impact the
ability of TopCo Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Letters. Upon any
such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Debt
Letters" and  "Definitive Debt Financing Agreements" shall mean the Debt
Letters or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, as applicable, as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or modified. TopCo Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement
or other modification of the Debt Letters or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements.

(d)  If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or
could reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and
conditions provided in the Financing Letters, or any of the Debt Letters or
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated,
terminated or rescinded for any reason, then TopCo Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) arrange and obtain from the same or
alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to, when added with the Equity Financing, available cash of TopCo
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, and the available
portion of the Debt Financing, consummate the Contemplated Transactions and
pay the Merger Consideration and the other Merger Amounts upon conditions not
less favorable to TopCo Parent, Parent and Merger Sub, than those in the Debt
Letters or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and (ii) obtain one or more
new debt financing agreements with respect to such alternative
financing consistent with clause (i) above (the " _New Debt Letters_ ").
TopCo Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any executed New
Debt Letters. In the event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance
with this _Section 7.05(d)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "), references in this
Agreement to the Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative
Financing, and references in this Agreement to the Financing Letters and the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to any New
Debt Letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and all obligations of TopCo Parent pursuant to this
_Section 7.05_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as TopCo
Parent's obligations with respect to the Financing.

  



  

(e)  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives to, provide such cooperation, as is
customary, on a timely basis and as is reasonably requested by TopCo Parent

such documents by officers of the Company in their capacity as officers of
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries), (F) provide any information or
documentation which, in the reasonable opinion of the Company or its legal

cooperate with TopCo Parent to provide such information, in whole or in part,

the Company, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred

obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.05_ (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and fees and expenses of accounting firms). No counsel for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company

Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to this _Section
7.05_ that would reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to
such Representative.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
TopCo Parent may enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements
and agreements relating to the Financing to add other equity providers, so
long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following
conditions are met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not
reduced; (ii) the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Acceptance Time or the Closing; and

constitute a waiver or reduction of TopCo Parent's rights under the Equity
Letters.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 7.05_ shall require, and in no event
shall the commercially reasonable efforts of TopCo Parent be deemed or
construed to require, TopCo Parent or any Affiliate thereof to (i) seek
Equity Financing from any other source other than the financing source
counterparty to any Definitive Equity Financing Agreements, or in any amount
in excess of that contemplated by the Equity Letters or (ii) pay any material
fees in excess of those contemplated by the Financing Letters.

  



  

Section 7.06 _Control of the Company 's Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct any of the operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective
operations.

dated as of December 7, 2018, and as subsequently amended as of October 31,
2019 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between TopCo Parent and the
Company shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing. If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

  



  

Section 7.09 _Further Actions_. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their respective best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action, to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under Applicable Law (other than with respect to the
matters covered in _Section 7.04_, which shall be governed by the provisions
of _Section 7.04_) to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger
and the other Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any
event no later than the Termination Date). Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, TopCo Parent shall use its best efforts to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to comply with their respective obligations under
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) During the period commencing at the Merger Effective Time and
ending on the date which is one (1) year from the Merger Effective Time (or
if earlier, the date of the employee's termination of employment with Parent
and its Subsidiaries), and to the extent consistent with the terms of the
governing plan documents, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to provide the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed immediately after the Merger
Effective Time (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with annual base
salary or wage level, annual target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-
based compensation), and employee benefits (excluding any retiree health or
defined benefit retirement benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable to any such employee than the annual base salary or wage level,
annual target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation), and
employee benefits (excluding any retiree health or defined benefit retirement
benefits) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such employee as of
the date of this Agreement.

applicable, to maintain the Company's Severance Pay Plan for Salaried
Employees and Severance Pay Plan for Senior Management (together, the "

its Subsidiaries, any defined benefit retirement plans or programs maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and any equity
compensation arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employees
will participate effective as of the Merger Effective Time, and subject to the
terms of the governing plan documents, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, credit all service of the Continuing Employees with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors, as the case may be as
if such service were with Parent, for purposes of eligibility to participate
(but not for purposes of vesting or benefit accrual, except for vacation, if
applicable) for full or partial years of service in any Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , that such service shall not be credited to
the extent that: (i) such crediting would result in a duplication of
benefits; or (ii) such service was not credited under the corresponding
Company Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to
the extent coverage under such Parent Benefit Plan is comparable to a Company
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Closing Date; and (ii) for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability, life insurance and/or
other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee (collectively, the "
_Parent Welfare Plans_ "): (A) Parent shall cause all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements of such Parent Welfare Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents; and (B) Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company Plan ending on
the date such Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding Parent
Welfare Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent Welfare Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payment, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such Parent Welfare Plan.

(e) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the Company Plans maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries that are set forth in _Section 7.10(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , that such Company Plans can be
terminated in accordance with their terms and Applicable Law without any
adverse consequences with respect to any of the Company's ERISA Affiliates.
No later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Plans have been
terminated.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take
such actions as Parent, Merger Sub or TopCo Parent may reasonably request so
as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect such actions relating to the
401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") as Parent, Merger Sub or
TopCo Parent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate, including amending
or terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Merger Effective Time, subject to
the terms of the 401(k) Plan and Applicable Law; provided that (i) if Parent,
Merger Sub or TopCo Parent request that the 401(k) Plan be amended or
terminated prior to the Merger Effective Time, such action shall be effective
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and (ii) if Parent, Merger Sub
or TopCo Parent request that the 401(k) Plan be amended or terminated, Parent
or its Subsidiaries shall permit each Continuing Employee to effect a
direct rollover (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and including
the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing loans) of such Continuing Employee's
balance (including after-tax employee contributions) under the 401(k) Plan to
a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time on or
after Closing Date, and shall take any and all actions needed to permit each
Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the 401(k) Plan as
of the Closing Date to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the 401(k)
Plan after the Closing Date, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of
the notes evidencing such loans so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably
possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such
outstanding loans.

  



  

(g) This _Section 7.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this

modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement; (ii) shall alter

program, agreement, or arrangement at any time assumed, established,

Corporation, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates from terminating
the employment of any Continuing Employee following the Merger Effective
Time. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this _Section 7.10_ shall not create any right in any Company Employee or any
other Person to any continued employment with the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever, or otherwise alters any existing at-will
employment relationship between any Company Employee and the Surviving

Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
(and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub's action or failure to fulfill any

(b) by either the Company or Parent, in the event that any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
Governmental Order that permanently enjoins the consummation of the Offer or

Order;

  



  

(c) by Parent, if a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would, if occurring or continuing at the Expiration

(f) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, in order for the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior

(g) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired
(after giving effect to any extensions thereof in accordance with this
Agreement) or been terminated, in each case, in accordance with the terms of

result of the Minimum Condition not being satisfied (i.e., all other Offer
Conditions were satisfied);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(g)_ shall not be
available to a Party that has breached its obligations in any material respect
under this Agreement (and, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub's breach of its
obligations in any material respect under this Agreement) in any manner that
shall have been the primary cause of the Minimum Condition not being
satisfied;

termination of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,

Company Transaction Agreement or consummates any Competing Company
Transaction, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company

particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such Proceeding and
waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any such Proceeding

agrees that service of process upon such Party at the address referred to in
_Section 10.02_ (or such other address as may be specified in accordance

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.11(a)_ , each
Party acknowledges and irrevocably agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, (i) that any Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Financing Letters or the
performance thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City and
State of New York (whether a state or Federal court), and any appellate court
from any thereof, (ii) that any Proceeding, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Sources shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to its principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily
applicable by statute and would require or permit the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction, (iii) not to bring, permit any of their Affiliates
to bring, or support anyone else in bringing, any such Proceeding before any
other Governmental Authority, (iv) that the provisions of this _Section
10.11(b)_ shall apply to any such Proceeding and (v) that the Financing

Section 10.12 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement that
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in
any other jurisdiction. The application of such invalid or unenforceable
provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held
invalid or unenforceable shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or
determined to be impermissible by any Governmental Authority, each of the
Parties agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to substitute one or more
valid, legal and enforceable provisions that, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of the prohibited,
unenforceable, or impermissible provision.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Captions_. The captions herein are included for
convenience of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or
interpretation hereof.

  



  

Section 10.14 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Each Party acknowledges that money damages would be both
incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement
by such Party and that any such breach would cause the other Parties
irreparable harm. Accordingly, each Party also agrees that, in the event of
any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by such
Party, the other Parties shall be entitled to equitable relief without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, and without proof of actual
damages, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific
performance, in addition to all other remedies available to such other
Parties at law or in equity. The Parties agree that they will not contest the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 10.14(a)_ or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to
consummate the Offer or the Merger unless (i) all of the Offer Conditions and
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(b)_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Offer Closing or the Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) the Company has given notice in
writing to Parent representing that it is ready, willing and able complete
the Offer Closing and the Closing, (iii) the full amount of the Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Offer Closing or the Closing and
(iv) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Offer Closing or the
Closing by the respective date the Offer Closing or the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

referred to in such Section) and (ii) in _Section 10.03(c_ ), _Section
10.11(b)_ and _Section 10.17_ (in each case, which shall be to the benefit of
the Financing Sources), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties
hereto and their permitted assigns and respective successors and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.16 _Non-Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims of action that may be
based upon, arise out of, or relate to, this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be made against the
Parties, and no former, current or future Affiliates, officers, directors,
managers, employees, equityholders, lenders, Financing Sources, managers,

otherwise);  _provided_ that the rights of the Financing Sources pursuant to
_Section 10.17_ hereof shall not be impaired as a result of this _Section
10.16_.

  



  

Section 10.17 _Financing Sources Disclaimer_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereto acknowledge and
irrevocably agree that none of the Financing Sources will have any Liability
to the Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder,
and in no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

The corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to
be made a party to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason of
the fact that he or she (i) is or was a director or officer of the
corporation or (ii) while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner,
venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of
another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the
fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended. Such right shall be a contract right
and as such shall run to the benefit of any director or officer who is
elected and accepts the position of director or officer of the corporation or
elects to continue to serve as a director or officer of the corporation while
this Article VIII is in effect. Any repeal or amendment of this Article VIII
shall be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of any such director
or officer or the obligations of the corporation with respect to any claim
arising from or related to the services of such director or officer in any of
the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to this
Article VIII. Such right shall include the right to be paid by
the corporation expenses incurred in investigating or defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent
permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60)
days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the claimant
may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the
unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or
advancement of costs of defense is not permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the
corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of
directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or
stockholders) to have made its determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of, or advancement of costs of defense to, the
claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by
the corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof,
independent legal counsel, or stockholders) that such indemnification or
advancement is not permissible shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. In
