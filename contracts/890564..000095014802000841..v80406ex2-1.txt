                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         3.1 Effect on Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of Company
Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock:

               (a) Merger Consideration for Company Capital Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock and each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(c)) shall, at the Effective Time, be
exchanged for and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Ratio
applicable to each such share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, as the case may be, of (i) that number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest thousandth, equal to the
quotient derived by dividing $75 million by the Average Price of Parent Common
Stock (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2(d)), less that
number of shares, if any, in the Escrow Account (A) returned to Parent or sold
pursuant to the indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders
contained in Article VIII or (B) returned to Parent pursuant to Section 3.3 of
this Agreement, and (ii) cash of $75 million less the amount of (A) Company Debt
and (B) any cash in the Escrow Account that is remitted to Parent pursuant to
the indemnification obligations of the Company Stockholders contained in Article
VIII or returned to Parent pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement (the "CASH
MERGER CONSIDERATION"). The shares of Parent Common Stock described in clause
(i) above and the Cash Merger Consideration described in clause (ii) above are
collectively referred to herein as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION".

         If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent should split or combine the
Parent Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in
Parent Common Stock, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such split, combination, dividend or other distribution.

               (b) Stock of Sub. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
and the stock of the Surviving Corporation issued in that conversion shall
constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

               (c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Related Party Stock. Each
share of Company Capital Stock owned by the Company, the Company Sub, any entity
controlling the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of such entities shall
automatically be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof and no
Merger Consideration shall be delivered with respect thereto.

         3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

               (a) Exchange Procedures. Upon the surrender to Parent of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the "CERTIFICATES"),
each record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable Merger Consideration provided for in Section 3.1(a) for each share of
Company Capital Stock represented by the Certificates, reduced by such holder's
Pro-Rata Share of the Escrow Amount ("PRO-RATA ESCROW AMOUNT") attributable to
such Merger Consideration for such shares of Company Capital Stock. Parent shall
transfer the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit in the Escrow Account
immediately after the Effective Time and the Escrow Amount shall be held in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. All Cash
Merger Consideration shall be paid by the wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the accounts of the Company Stockholders. Each Company Stockholder
shall provide Parent with written instructions identifying his or its account at
least three Business Days prior to the Closing. All Certificates surrendered
pursuant to this Section 3.2(a) shall immediately be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Company, a certificate representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and the Cash Merger Consideration (less the Pro-Rata Escrow Amount)
may be issued and delivered to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, is presented to
Parent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right
to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration (less the Pro-Rata
Escrow Amount) applicable to the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by
such Certificate) and all dividends or other distributions thereon with a record
date after the Effective Time as contemplated by Section 3.2(b).

               (b) Distributions with Respect to Shares Prior to Exchange of
Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the Parent Common Stock represented thereby as a result of the
exchange and conversion provided in Section 3.1(a), and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 3.2(d), until the holder of such Certificate surrenders such
Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest: (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

               (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
for and upon the conversion of the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 3.2(b) or 3.2(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, and after the Effective Time there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
III.

               (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall
be issued pursuant to this Article III, and, except as provided in this Section
3.2(d), no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate
to any such fractional security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder of Parent. In
lieu of any fractional security, Parent shall pay to each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Common Stock pursuant to this Article III an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the sum of (i) the fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled, multiplied by the Average Price of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the
aggregate dividends or other distributions that are payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2(b) (such dividends and
distributions being herein called the "FRACTIONAL DIVIDENDS"). For purposes of
determining whether a holder of shares of the Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock is to receive payment in lieu of fractional shares, all shares
of Company Capital Stock held of record by such holder shall be aggregated.

         3.3 Return of Merger Consideration. Parent shall be entitled to have
returned to it $5 million of the Merger Consideration to be deposited into the
Escrow Account if the Revenues (as defined below), do not meet or exceed the
"Revenue Hurdle" for the Term. For purposes of clarification, the $5 million
deposited into the Escrow Account is part of the aggregate Escrow Amount. If
this $5 million in Merger Consideration is returned to Parent pursuant to this
Section 3.3, it shall consist of $2.5 million in immediately available funds and
$2.5 million in Parent Common Stock valued for purposes of this Section 3.3 at a

Agreement, the "Revenues" of the Acquired Business during the Term shall mean
the revenues from operations of the Acquired Business as determined in
accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company for its fiscal year
ended June 30, 2001. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with the

shall not be included in the computation of Revenues. In determining the

               (c) Time of Determination. The Revenues shall be determined

days thereafter, by Parent. Copies of the report setting forth Parent's
computation of the Revenues of the Acquired Business shall be submitted in
writing to Stockholder Representative (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) and,
unless Stockholder Representative notifies Parent in writing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the report (the "OBJECTION PERIOD") that it objects to the
computation of the Revenues set forth therein, the report shall be binding and
conclusive on all parties to this Agreement and all Company Stockholders for the
purposes of this Merger Agreement. Stockholder Representative or its authorized
representative shall have access to the books and records of the Company and the
Surviving Corporation during regular business hours to verify the computation of
Revenues made by Parent. If Stockholder Representative notifies Parent in

representative shall have access to the workpapers relating to the Agreed-Upon
Procedures Report. If the Agreed-Upon Procedures Report indicates that the
Revenue Hurdle has been met, then Parent shall pay the Special Accountants'
fees, costs and expenses. If the Agreed-Upon Procedures Report indicates that
the Revenue Hurdle has not been met, then the Special Accountants' fees, costs
and expenses shall be paid to Parent from the Escrow Account by the Escrow
Agent. If Parent is entitled to the return of the $5 million of Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.3, such amount shall be delivered to
Parent within three (3) Business Days of the earlier of (i) the expiration of
the Objection Period (assuming no objection was brought within the Objection
Period) or the date prior to the expiration of the Objection Period that
Stockholder Representative notifies the Escrow Agent that it does not object to
the determination contained in Parent's report, (ii) Parent and Stockholder
Representative's delivery of a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent that the
Revenue Hurdle was not met, or (iii) delivery to the Escrow Agent of the Agreed
Upon Procedures Report that indicates the Revenue Hurdle was not met. The
parties agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (i) the return of the $5 Million of
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be satisfied solely from
the funds held in the Escrow Account and (ii) if the Escrow Account would
otherwise be distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and
assuming that there is still sufficient Merger Consideration remaining in the
Escrow Account, Escrow Agent shall continue to hold at least $5 million of the
Merger Consideration (or such lesser amount then remaining in the Escrow
Account) until there has been a final determination pursuant to this Section 3.3
as to whether Parent is entitled to the


                                      -12-

Consideration and 50% of Parent's Common Stock, valued at the Section 3.3
Average Price.

to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under, or result in any Encumbrance upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or the Company Sub under any provision
of (A) the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of the Company or

records of each of the Company and the Company Sub, all of which have been made

Management Stockholders, the Company and the Company Sub are in compliance with
the terms of the Company Permits. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(j) to the

maintenance and repairs that are not material in nature or cost. The Company
Assets are sufficient for the continued conduct of the Company's business after
the Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing.

               (l) Litigation and Claims. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(l)
to the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no (i) suit, action, claim or
proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Management
Stockholders, threatened against the Company or the Company Sub ("COMPANY
LITIGATION"), or (ii) judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or the Company
Sub ("COMPANY ORDER"). To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to or serve as a
basis for the commencement of any such Company Litigation. Schedule 4.1(l) to
the Company Disclosure Letter lists all Company Litigation or other proceedings,
including, without limitation, any Company Litigation relating to any workers'
compensation (pending, settled or reopened), employer practices, medical
malpractice or professional liability matters and any Company Litigation

                      (i) Benefit Plans. Schedule 4.1(n)(i) to the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of each of the following
items: each employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or customary practice
covering any current or former officer, director, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company or any of their

which the Company or any Affiliates of the Company may have any liability,
including, but not limited to, any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of

scholarship program, retention incentive program, vacation


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

policy and sick pay policy. The items described above, together with each
management, employment, deferred compensation, severance, change in control,
bonus or other contract for personal services with or covering any Company
Beneficiary, whether or not terminated, if the Company or the Company Sub could
have statutory or contractual liability with respect thereto on or after the
date hereof, are referred to collectively herein as the "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS."

                      (ii) Contributions and Payments. All contributions and
other payments required to have been made by the Company, the Company Sub or any
entity required to be aggregated therewith pursuant to section 414 of the Code
("COMPANY ERISA AFFILIATE") with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (or to any
person pursuant to the terms thereof) have been made or are properly accrued

the financial statements of the Company or the Company Sub.

                      (iii) Qualification; Compliance. The terms of each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of section
401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to satisfy the requirements
of section 401(a) of the Code, or the applicable remedial period applicable to
the Company Benefit Plan will not have ended prior to the Effective Time, and no
event or condition exists or has occurred that could result in the revocation or
denial of any such determination. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the
Company and each Company ERISA Affiliate are in compliance with, and each
Company Benefit Plan and related source of benefit payment is and has been
operated in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules and regulations
governing such plan or source, including, without limitation, ERISA, the Code
and applicable local law (including non-U.S. law). No Company Benefit Plan is

of the IRS, the Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity.

                      (iv) Liabilities. With respect to the Company Benefit
Plans, individually and in the aggregate, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances that could subject the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate to
any liability arising under the Code, ERISA or any other applicable law
(including, without limitation, any liability to or under any such plan or to
the PBGC, or under any indemnity agreement to which the Company or any Company
ERISA Affiliate is a party). No claim, action or litigation has been made,
commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, by or against the
Company, or the Company Sub with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

                      (v) Payments Resulting from Merger. Except as disclosed on
Schedule 4.1(n)(v) to the Company Disclosure Letter, the consummation or
announcement of any transaction contemplated by this Merger Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or further acts or
events) result in (A) any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
becoming due from the Company or the Company Sub to any Company Beneficiary, or
(B) any benefit under any Company Benefit Plan being established or increased,
or becoming accelerated, vested or payable.

                      (vi) Absence of Defined Benefit Plans. Neither the Company
nor any entity (whether or not incorporated) that was at any time during the
past six years a Company ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or had any
liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Operating Sub holds all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for it to own,

any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or Operating Sub is pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened.

request for information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for nonpublic information relating to the Company by any Person who, to the
knowledge of the Company, is making or considering making or who has made an
Acquisition Proposal, that comes to the attention of the Company the terms
thereof, including, without limitation, the identity of the Person making such

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         6.1 Access to Information. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.2,
upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of Parent, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period,
shall furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Parent agrees that
neither it nor its representatives will use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.1 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to give Parent any information that
is subject to a confidentiality agreement and that relates primarily to a party
other than the Company. The


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 5, 2001 between Parent and the
Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") shall apply with respect to
information furnished thereunder or hereunder and any other activities
contemplated thereby.

         6.2 Legal Conditions to Merger.

               (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the Company, the
Company Sub, Parent and Sub will take all reasonable actions necessary to comply
promptly with all Legal Requirements that may be imposed on such party with
respect to the Merger (including, without limitation, furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with
any other Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and furnish
information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon
any of them in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall
take all reasonable actions as may be necessary to obtain (and will cooperate
with each other in obtaining) any consent, acquiescence, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption or nonopposition by, any Governmental Entity or
court required to be obtained or made by the Company, the Company Sub, Parent or
Sub in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated
thereby or by this Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, complying
with any requests or orders made by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade
Commission in connection with the Merger. Parent and the Company agree to share
equally in the payment of any and all filing fees relating to the HSR filing.

               (b) Company and Parent shall each file a premerger notification
and report form under the HSR Act (and any other applicable foreign antitrust
law or regulation) with respect to the Merger as promptly as reasonably possible
following execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement. Each of the parties
agrees to use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any request for
additional information that may be received from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the HSR filing or any filing under applicable foreign antitrust
laws and regulations. Except as otherwise required by United States regulatory
considerations, the Company will furnish to Parent copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof
(collectively, "COMPANY HSR DOCUMENTS")) between the Company, or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, or members of the
staff of such agency or authority, on the other hand, with respect to this
Merger Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that (i) with respect to
documents and other materials filed by or on behalf of the Company with the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission,
or any state attorneys general that are available for review by Parent, copies
will not be required to be provided to Parent and (ii) with respect to any
Company HSR Documents (1) that contain any information which, in the reasonable
judgment of Keating, Muething & Klekamp, P.L.L., should not be furnished to
Parent because of antitrust considerations or (2) relating to a request for
additional information pursuant to Section (e)(1) of the HSR Act, the obligation
of the Company to furnish any such Company HSR Documents to Parent shall be
satisfied by the delivery of such Company HSR Documents on a confidential basis
to Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
containing terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Except as otherwise required
by United States regulatory considerations, Parent will furnish to the Company
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof (collectively, "PARENT HSR DOCUMENTS")) between
Parent or any of its representatives, on the


                                      -42-
<PAGE>

one hand, and any Governmental Entity, or member of the staff of such agency or
authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Merger Agreement or the
Merger; provided, however, that (i) with respect to documents and other
materials filed by or on behalf of Parent with the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or any state attorneys
general that are available for review by the Company, copies will not be
required to be provided to the Company, and (ii) with respect to any Parent HSR
Documents (1) that contain information which, in the reasonable judgment of
Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., should not be furnished to the Company because of
antitrust considerations or (2) relating to a request for additional information
pursuant to Section (e)(1) of the HSR Act, the obligation of Parent to furnish
any such Parent HSR Documents to the Company shall be satisfied by the delivery
of such Parent HSR Documents on a confidential basis to Keating, Muething &
Klekamp, P.L.L. pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

               (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Merger Agreement shall be construed so as to require Parent, Sub, the Company or
the Company Sub to sell, license, dispose of, or hold separate, or to operate in
any specified manner, any assets or businesses of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Company Sub or the Surviving Corporation or to defend any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings by a Governmental Entity, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or to seek to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed (or to
require Parent, Sub, the Company or the Company Sub to agree to any of the
foregoing).

         6.3 Stock Options and Warrant.

               (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, each
outstanding stock option granted under the Company Stock Plan to the Management
Stockholders and Wead, and to each other option holder who is not cashed out on
or prior to the Effective Time, that is vested or exercisable immediately prior
to or at the Effective Time (a "VESTED OPTION" and, collectively, the "VESTED
OPTIONS") shall be exercised and the Company shall issue that number of shares
of Company Common Stock that the holder thereof is entitled to receive pursuant
to such Vested Option, subject to any adjustment in the number of shares
resulting from any cashless exercise thereof. The holders of Company Common
Stock to be received upon exercise of the Vested Options shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration received by the Company Stockholders pursuant
to Article III hereof. The Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof
responsible for the administration of the Company Stock Plans shall take any and
all action necessary to effectuate the matters described in this Section 6.3(a)
on or before the Effective Time. Schedule 6.3(a) to the Company's Disclosure
Letter sets forth the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and
available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Vested Options and sets
forth the exercise price for each such Vested Option. Any amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be subject to any required withholding of
Taxes and shall be paid without interest. All other options granted by the
Company (other than Vested Options) shall be canceled without any conversion
thereof by the Company prior to the Effective Time and no consideration shall be
delivered with respect thereto.

               (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Warrant shall be exercised and the Company shall issue 5,100 shares of Company
Common Stock to the holder


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

thereof, subject to any adjustment in the number of shares resulting from a
cashless exercise thereof. The holder of the Warrant shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration received by the Company Stockholders pursuant
to Article III hereof. The Company's Board of Directors or any committee thereof
responsible for overseeing the exercise of the Warrant shall take any and all
action necessary to effectuate the matters described in this Section 6.3(b) on
or before the Effective Time. Schedule 6.3(b) to the Company's Disclosure Letter
sets forth the number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and available
for issuance upon exercise of the Warrant and the exercise price. The parties
acknowledge, however, that the holder of the Warrant intends to effect a
cashless exercise of the Warrant, and the Company Disclosure Letter does not
reflect the number of shares that will be issued to the Warrant holder upon a
cashless exercise of the Warrant.

         6.4 Payment of Accrued Dividends. On or before the Closing Date, the
Company shall have paid all accrued dividends due to the holders of the Company
Preferred Stock, as set forth on Schedule 4.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Company may, prior to the Effective
Time, upon approval of the holders of the Company Preferred Stock and the
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, issue a stock
dividend to the holders of the Company Preferred Stock in lieu of and in
complete satisfaction of the accrued dividends.

         6.5 Registration Rights Agreement. Parent, the Non-Management
Stockholders, other than Wead, and Michael shall enter into a Registration
Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "REGISTRATION
RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), which agreement shall be executed and delivered at the
Closing.

         6.6 Agreement to Defend. In the event any claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding by any Person, other than a Governmental
Entity, or other legal or administrative proceeding is commenced by a Person,
other than a Governmental Entity, that questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable efforts to defend
against and respond thereto.

         6.7 Public Announcements. Parent shall consult with the Company before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect
to this Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Merger
Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except that Parent may respond to
questions from stockholders and inquiries from financial analysts and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice and may make such
disclosures as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with Nasdaq without prior consultation to the extent such
consultation is not reasonably practicable. The parties agree that the initial
press release or releases to be issued in connection with the execution of this
Merger Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof.
The Company may not make any press release or public statements with respect to
this Merger Agreement or the Merger without Parent's prior written consent.

         6.8 Other Actions. Except as contemplated by this Merger Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall take or agree or commit to take any action
that is reasonably likely to


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

result in any of its representations or warranties hereunder being untrue in any
material respect or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article
VII not being satisfied.

         6.9 Advice of Changes. The Company shall promptly advise Parent, and
Parent shall promptly advise the Company, orally and in writing of any change or
event having, or which, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, could have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as the case may be. The
Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their respective
counsel) copies of all filings made by such party with any state or federal
Governmental Entity in connection with this Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         6.10 Voting Agreements. Each of the Company Stockholders who is
identified on Exhibit G attached hereto shall have executed a Voting Agreement
to be delivered to Parent concurrently with the execution of this Merger
Agreement (the "VOTING AGREEMENT").

         6.11 Stockholder Vote. The Company shall call a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company to be held no later than twenty (20) days following
the execution of this Merger Agreement for the purpose of approving this Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Company's Board of
Directors shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote for such
approval.

         6.12 Registration of Form S-3. Parent shall use its best efforts to
take all actions reasonably necessary from the time of signing through the
Effective Time to maintain the right to register the Parent Common Stock on Form
S-3. Parent shall comply with the requirements of Rule 144 as amended from time
to time.

         6.13 Limitation on Michael's Representations and Warranties. It is
understood and agreed by all parties to this Merger Agreement that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Michael Agreement or this Merger
Agreement, if the Closing does not occur before June 1, 2002, the
representations and warranties of Michael set forth in Section 4.1 of this
Merger Agreement that in any manner relate to the business, operations,
condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or results of the Company or the
Company Sub, collectively "Company Condition", shall speak only as of March 22,
2002, rather than as of the date of the execution of this Merger Agreement, and
shall not be considered for purposes of any indemnification Claim by an
Indemnified Parent Party arising under Section 8.2(a) of this Merger Agreement
to cover any change in the Company Condition that has occurred after that date.

<PAGE>

required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
made or obtained (as the case may be), except where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, permits and authorizations would not be reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent (assuming the Merger has taken
place) or to materially adversely affect the consummation of the Merger or the
Surviving Corporation.

               (b) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition (an "INJUNCTION")
preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; provided, however,

its obligations under Section 6.6 hereof and, in addition, shall have used all
reasonable efforts to have any such decree, ruling, injunction or order vacated,
except as otherwise contemplated by this Merger Agreement.

reasonable determination of Parent, not have a Material Adverse Effect on the

               (a) The Company and the Company Stockholders shall be obligated
to indemnify save and hold harmless Parent, its directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, agents and assigns (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARENT PARTY"), from and
against any and all Losses (whether or not arising out of third-party claims)
and all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the
foregoing (collectively with Losses, "DAMAGES") incurred in connection with,
arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company or by any Management Stockholder

Merger.

               (b) In addition to the indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) hereof and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the

indemnify, hold harmless, pay and reimburse Indemnified Parent Parties for all

limited for each Company Stockholder to each such Company Stockholder's Pro Rata
Share (except to the extent set forth below), without regard to any of the
limitations set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.6, that are caused by (i) fraud
and/or "INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION" by the Company or either of the
Management Stockholders of any of their representations and warranties contained
in this Merger Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter or any of the Related
Documents, and (ii) knowing, intentional or willful breaches by the Company or
either of the Management Stockholders of their covenants or agreements contained
in this Merger Agreement or any of the Related Documents to which they are
parties; provided, however, that each Company Stockholder shall, with respect to

out of his, her or its own fraud or Intentional Misrepresentation or knowing,
intentional or willful breaches of his, her or its covenants or agreements
contained in this Merger Agreement or any of the Related Documents to which he,
she or it is a party, and (B) up to the amount of the Merger Consideration
received by such Company Stockholder. For purposes of this Merger Agreement,

any of the Related Documents or that are the subject of the covenants or
agreements of the Company or the Management Stockholders contained in this
Merger Agreement or any of the Related Documents to which they are parties. In
determining whether an Intentional Misrepresentation occurred regarding any
representations and warranties by the Company or the Management Stockholders,
the Management Stockholders shall not be deemed responsible for any other
Person's knowledge or intent nor shall there be any constructive or imputed
knowledge.

               (c) The Management Stockholders and the Company each agree to
notify Parent of any liabilities, claims or misrepresentations, breaches or
other matters covered by this


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

Article VIII upon discovery or receipt of notice thereof (other than from
Parent), whether before or after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 8.2 to the contrary, the Company shall not have any indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Section 8.2 after the Effective Time of the Merger.

         8.3 Indemnification by Parent.

               (a) Parent and Sub shall jointly and severally indemnify, save
and hold harmless the Company Stockholders and their directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents and assigns (each an "INDEMNIFIED COMPANY PARTY"
and together with an Indemnified Parent Party, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and
against any and all Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of,
resulting from or incident to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty
made by Parent or Sub in this Merger Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Letter or
any of the Related Documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement made by Parent or Sub in this Merger
Agreement or any of the Related Documents delivered pursuant hereto or thereto,
or (iii) any claim by any Person for broker's or finder's fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have been
made by such Person with Parent or Sub (or any Person acting on Parent's or
Sub's behalf) in connection with the Merger.

               (b) In addition to the indemnification obligations pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) hereof and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Parent and Sub jointly and severally agree to indemnify, hold
harmless, pay and reimburse Indemnified Company Parties for all Damages, without
regard to any of the limitations set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.6, that are
caused by (i) fraud and/or Intentional Misrepresentation by Parent or Sub of
their representations and warranties contained in this Merger Agreement, the
Parent Disclosure Letter or any of the Related Documents, and (ii) knowing,
intentional or willful breaches by Parent or Sub of their covenants or
agreements contained in this Merger Agreement or any of the Related Documents to
which they are parties; provided, however, that Parent and Sub shall be liable
under this Section 8.3(b) only for Damages in an amount not to exceed
$50,000,000. For purposes of this Merger Agreement, "INTENTIONAL
MISREPRESENTATION" by Parent or Sub shall mean a willful and intentional
misrepresentation of any facts, information or other matters that are the
subject of their representations and warranties or disclosures contained in this
Merger Agreement, the Parent Disclosure Letter or any of the Related Documents
or that are the subject of the covenants or agreements of Parent or Sub
contained in this Merger Agreement or any of the Related Documents to which they
are parties.

               (c) Each of Parent and Sub agrees to notify the Company of any
liabilities, claims or misrepresentations, breaches or other matters covered by
this Article VIII upon discovery or receipt of notice thereof (other than from
the Company), whether before or after the Closing.

         8.4 Damages. The term "Damages" as used in Section 8.2 and 8.3 is not
limited to matters asserted by third parties against any Indemnified Party, but
includes Damages incurred or sustained by an Indemnified Party in the absence of
third party claims. Payments by any Indemnified Party of amounts for which such
Indemnified Party is indemnified hereunder shall not be a condition precedent to
recovery. Subject to Section 8.6(a), 8.6(b) and 8.6(d), the rights and remedies
provided in this Article VIII shall be exclusive as to any Damages incurred by a


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

party under this Merger Agreement and the Related Documents; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall preclude a party from exercising its rights under this
Merger Agreement, the Related Documents and applicable law to such equitable
remedies as may be available, including without limitation, specific performance
and injunctions.

         8.5 Procedure

               (a) Cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the indemnifying party and its representatives
(including, without limitation, its attorneys) in the investigation, trial and
defense of such lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may at its own cost participate in
negotiations, arbitration and the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom. The parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

               (b) Defense of Claim. If a claim for Damages (a "CLAIM") is to be
made by an Indemnified Party against the indemnifying party, the Indemnified
Party shall give written notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE") to the indemnifying party as
soon as practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact,
condition or event which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may
be sought under this Article VIII. If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed
against any party entitled to the benefit of indemnity hereunder, written notice
thereof shall be given to the indemnifying party as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the service of the citation or
summons). The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder
for any purpose shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to
the extent that the indemnifying party has been materially damaged by such
failure. After such notice, except as provided in the following sentence, if the
indemnifying party shall acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party that
the indemnifying party shall be obligated under the terms of its indemnity
hereunder in connection with such lawsuit or action, then the indemnifying party
shall be entitled, if it so elects at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to
take control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or action, (ii) to
employ and engage attorneys of its own choice but, in any event, reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party, to handle and defend the same unless the
named parties to such action or proceedings (including any impleaded parties)
include both the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one
or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, in which event
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the indemnifying party's cost, risk
and expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing and (iii) to compromise or
settle such lawsuit or action, which compromise or settlement shall be made only
with the written consent of the Indemnified Party. The Company Stockholders may
assume the defense of a lawsuit or action as described in the preceding sentence
only if the Company Stockholders agree to be responsible for all Claims for
Damages related to such lawsuit or action or if there are sufficient moneys
available held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to cover all such Claims for
Damages.

         If the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of such lawsuit
or action within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party against which such lawsuit or action has been asserted shall
(upon delivering notice to such effect to the indemnifying party) have the right
to undertake, at the indemnifying party's cost and expense,


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

the defense, compromise or settlement of such lawsuit or action on behalf of and
for the account and risk of the indemnifying party. In the event the Indemnified
Party assumes the defense of the lawsuit or action, the Indemnified Party shall
keep the indemnifying party reasonably informed of the progress of any such
defense, compromise or settlement. The indemnifying party shall be liable for
any settlement of any action effected pursuant to and in accordance with this
Article VIII and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal) and the
indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless an Indemnified Party
from and against any Damages by reason of such settlement or judgment.

         8.6 Limitation on Indemnification After the Effective Time.

               (a) The Indemnified Parent Parties may not recover Damages after
the Effective Time from the Company and the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) until their aggregate Damages exceed $1,000,000 (the
"THRESHOLD"); provided, however, that if the aggregate amount of Damages for
which such parties are seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
exceeds the Threshold then such Indemnified Parent Parties may recover only the
amount of such Damages that exceeds the Threshold. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the maximum, aggregate amount of Damages for which the Company
and the Company Stockholders shall be liable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall be
$15,000,000 (the "MAXIMUM INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNT"); provided, however, that the
Maximum Indemnification Amount shall not limit the amount of Damages for which
the Company and the Company Stockholders shall be liable pursuant to Section
8.2(b); and (ii) with respect to indemnification of any Claim pursuant to
Section 8.2(a), each Company Stockholder shall only be responsible for his
Pro-Rata Share of any Damages arising from each Claim limited to, in the
aggregate for all such Claims, such Company Stockholder's Pro-Rata Share of the
Maximum Indemnification Amount. Amounts due as a result of indemnification
herein shall, in the sole discretion of the Stockholder Representative, be paid
by (i) selling shares of Parent Common Stock and distributing the net proceeds
thereof to Parent in connection with the payment of any Claim, (ii) paying any
such Claim from the Cash Merger Consideration deposited in the Escrow, or (iii)
returning to Parent shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, "PAYMENT
ALTERNATIVES"). Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to elect any or all
of the Payment Alternatives in connection with the payment of a Claim from the
Escrow Amount, provided, however, in no event shall Stockholder Representative
be entitled to pay more than 50% of any Claim by the delivery to Parent of
shares of Parent Common Stock. Any shares of Parent Common Stock that are
returned to Parent as partial payment of a Claim shall be valued at their
average daily closing price as reported on the Nasdaq during the ten (10)
trading days ending on the day immediately preceding the date such shares are
distributed to Parent by the Escrow Agent. Nothing contained herein, however,
shall (i) preclude Parent from bringing an action for specific performance or
other available equitable remedy for a breach of any covenant or agreement under
Section 8.2, or (ii) constitute a waiver by Parent or a limitation of its rights
or remedies against the Company or the Company Stockholders based on fraud or
Intentional Misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the indemnification obligations of the Company and the Company
Stockholders under Section 8.2(a) and the $5 million of Merger Consideration
returnable to Parent under the circumstances described in Section 3.3 of the
Agreement shall be satisfied only from the funds held in the Escrow Account;
provided, however, that after the termination of the Escrow Account, any Damages
arising from any Claim brought pursuant to

                                      -52-
<PAGE>
Section 8.2(a) due to a breach of Section 4.1(m) or 4.1(r) shall be paid,
subject to the Threshold, by the Company Stockholders in accordance with each
Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Share.

               (b) Indemnified Parties shall have the right to make a Claim
hereunder prior to the time at which the Threshold that is applicable to such
Claim has been surpassed for the purposes of asserting such Claim within the
relevant survival period of the applicable indemnification obligation and any
such Claim made within such period shall, to the extent such Threshold
ultimately is met, survive until its final resolution.

               (c) The Company Stockholders agree that, at the Closing, Parent
shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit in the Escrow
Account. Parent shall deposit such funds and Parent Common Stock with the Escrow
Agent. The funds shall be held, invested and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Company Stockholders and Parent agree to give
promptly any necessary instructions through the Stockholder Representative to
the Escrow Agent to cause such funds and Parent Common Stock to be placed in the
Escrow Account. Subject to the conditions in Section 3.3 of this Merger
Agreement, at the expiration of the twelve (12)-month Escrow Account term set
forth in Section 4 of the Escrow Agreement, any amounts of cash or Parent Common
Stock not subject to Claims made by Indemnified Parent Parties shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

               (d) An Indemnified Company Party may not recover Damages from
Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(a) until the aggregate amount of Damages relating
to such Claims for which such Indemnified Company Party, in the aggregate, is
seeking indemnification under Section 8.3(a) exceeds the Threshold; provided,
however, that if the aggregate amount of Damages for which such Indemnified
Company Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) exceeds the
Threshold, such Indemnified Company Party may recover only the amount of all
such Damages that exceeds the Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
maximum amount of Damages for which Parent shall be liable pursuant to Section
8.3(a) shall be the Maximum Indemnification Amount. Nothing contained herein,
however, shall (i) preclude any Company Stockholder from bringing an action for
specific performance or other available equitable remedy for a breach of any
covenant or agreement under Section 8.3 or (ii) constitute a waiver by any
Company Stockholder or a limitation of the rights or remedies of any Company
Stockholder against Parent or Sub based on fraud or Intentional
Misrepresentation.

               (e) Neither (i) the termination of the representations or
warranties contained herein, nor (ii) the expiration of the indemnification
obligations described above, shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party in
respect of any Claim made by such party received by the indemnifying party prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period provided herein.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

         9.1 Termination. This Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after the Company Stockholder Approval:

               (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

               (b) by either the Company or Parent if the average per share
daily closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on Nasdaq during the 5
consecutive trading days ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
is greater than 125% or less than 75% of the Average Price of Parent Common
Stock.

               (c) by either the Company or Parent if (A) the Merger shall not
have been consummated within the later of (i) 60 days after the signing of this
Merger Agreement by the parties (provided that the right to terminate this
Merger Agreement under this clause (i) shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any representation or warranty or failure to fulfill any covenant or
agreement under this Merger Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date); or (ii) the date that
all filings and approvals required pursuant to Section 7.1(a) have been
completed or obtained, but in no event later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after the signing of this Merger Agreement by the parties; or (B) any court of
competent jurisdiction, or some other Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable (the "TERMINATION DATE");

               (d) by Parent if (i) the Company shall have failed to comply in
any material respect with any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Merger Agreement to be complied with or performed by the Company at or prior to
such date of termination (provided such breach has not been cured within 30 days
following receipt by the Company of notice of such breach and is existing at the
time of termination of this Merger Agreement); or (ii) any of the
representations and warranties of the Company or the Management Stockholders
contained in this Merger Agreement shall not have been true and correct in any
material respect when made (provided such breach has not been cured within 30
days following receipt by the Company of notice of such breach and is existing
at the time of termination of this Merger Agreement) or on and as of the Closing
Date as if made on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent it relates
to a particular date); or

               (e) by the Company if (i) Parent or Sub shall have failed to
comply in any material respect with any of the covenants or agreements contained
in this Merger Agreement to be complied with or performed by it at or prior to
such date of termination (provided such breach has not been cured within 30 days
following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach and is existing at the time
of termination of this Merger Agreement); or (ii) any representations and
warranties of Parent or Sub contained in this Merger Agreement shall not have
been true and correct in any material respect when made (provided such breach
has not been cured within 30

                                      -54-
<PAGE>
days following receipt by Parent of notice of such breach and is existing at
the time of termination of this Merger Agreement) or on and as of the Effective
Time as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent it relates
to a particular date).

         9.2 Effect of Termination. Each party's right of termination under
Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e), respectively, is in addition to any other
rights it may have under this Merger Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of
such right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.l, all obligations of the parties
under this Merger Agreement shall terminate, except that the obligations of the
parties in the last sentence of Section 6.1, Section 9.2 and Section 10.1 will
survive, provided, however, that if this Merger Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(e), or
because one or more of the terminating party's obligations under this Merger
Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the party's failure to comply with its
obligations under this Merger Agreement, the terminating party's right to pursue
all legal remedies shall survive such termination unimpaired.

         9.3 Amendment. This Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at
any time before the Effective Time. This Merger Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

         9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto;
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (iii) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.

                                    ARTICLE X

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         10.1 Payment of Expenses. Each party hereto shall pay its own expenses
incident to preparing for entering into and carrying out this Merger Agreement,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not the
Merger shall be consummated.

         10.2 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The
representations, warranties and agreements in this Merger Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Merger Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time pursuant to the terms of Article VIII. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement, and
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information
and material delivered hereunder.

         10.3 Notices. Any notice or communication required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally

DGCL or the Ohio Law mandatorily applies to the mechanics of the Merger.

         10.8 No Remedy in Certain Circumstances. Each party agrees that, should
any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Merger
Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party
to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent
herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent
action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this
Merger Agreement or makes the Merger Agreement impossible to perform, in which
case this Merger Agreement may be terminated by any party pursuant to Article IX
hereof. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Merger Agreement, to the extent
that a party hereto took an action inconsistent herewith or failed to take
action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment
of a court or other competent authority, such party shall not incur any
liability or obligation unless such party breached its obligations under Section
6.6 hereof or did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition
or entering of such order or judgment.

         10.9 Assignment. Neither this Merger Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Merger
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

         10.10 Enforcement of the Merger Agreement. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Merger Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Merger
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In
addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in Delaware in the
event any dispute between the parties hereto arises out of this Merger Agreement
solely in connection with such a suit between the parties, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Merger Agreement in any court other than a federal or
state court sitting in Delaware.

         10.11 Performance by Sub. Parent hereby agrees to cause Sub to comply
with the obligations under this Merger Agreement.

         10.12 Severability. If any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Merger Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The
parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect
of which comes as close to possible to that of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions.

         10.13 Titles and Section Headings. The titles and section headings of
this Merger Agreement are for convenience of reference only and do not form a
part hereof and do not in any way modify, interpret or construe the intentions
of the parties hereto.

request to each other such further information, to execute and deliver to each
other such other documents and to do such other acts and things, all as the
other party may reasonably request, for the purpose of carrying out the intent
of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.
