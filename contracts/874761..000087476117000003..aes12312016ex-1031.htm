ARTICLE I 
Merger; Effect on Membership Interests; Closing

Section 1.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act ("DLLCA"), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub I and Merger Sub
II shall each be merged simultaneously with and into the Company, and (b) the

-2-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) will be at the
Effective Time owned by the MIP. The separate corporate existence of each of
Parent I and Parent II with all of their respective rights, privileges, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

Section 1.02. Certificate of Merger. As soon as practicable on the Closing
Date, upon consummation of the Closing, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DLLCA,
Parents, Merger Subs and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Representative and
the Company (the "Certificate of Merger") to be filed in accordance with the
DLLCA and shall make all other filings or recordings as required by Applicable
Law. The Merger shall be effective at the time and on the date of the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the DLLCA or at such later date or time as may be
agreed by the Majority Member and the Parent Representative in writing and

the Parent Representative, being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.03. Effect of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
DLLCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto,
by virtue of the Merger and without further act or deed, at the Effective Time
all property, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Merger Subs
shall vest in the Surviving LLC, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Subs shall become the debts, Liabilities and duties of the
Surviving LLC. At and after the Effective Time, each Member of the Company,
other than the MIP, shall cease to have any rights as a Member of the Company;
provided, however, that if the Effective Time occurs on or after November 1,
2017, each Member, including the MIP, shall cease to have any rights as a
Member.

Section 1.04. Closing. The closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date to be specified by the
Parties, which shall be no later than the seventh (7th) Business Day after

the Parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (not including conditions which are to be satisfied by the delivery
of documents or taking of any other action at the Closing by any Party, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such time) (such
date, the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by the Majority

Member and the Parent Representative. Regardless of the actual time of the
Closing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, for tax and accounting
purposes, the Closing shall be deemed effective as of the close of business on
the Closing Date.

Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub I, as
may be amended prior to the Closing, shall be the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving LLC, until duly amended as provided therein or by
Applicable Law. At the Closing, Parent I and Parent II shall, and, if the
Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, the Company shall direct
the MIP to, execute and deliver such limited liability company agreement (the
"Surviving Limited Liability Company Agreement").

Agreement or such other persons as the Parent Representative shall designate

accordance with the certificate of formation of the Surviving LLC and the
Surviving Limited Liability Company Agreement.

(b) Unless otherwise directed by written notice by the Parent Representative

true, complete and accurate listing of all items set forth in and amounts

disputes between or among the Members with respect to any allocation of the
Merger Consideration or other payments under this Agreement.

preferences as the Class B Units and such other rights, privileges and
preferences as may be mutually agreed by the Parties.

(iii) For purposes of calculating the amount to be paid by the Majority Member

following the Closing as set forth herein (including the right to receive the
applicable portion of any Excess Amount pursuant to Section 1.09(i) and the
applicable portion of any amounts released from the Majority Member Reserve
Fund in accordance with Section 9.14, or the obligation to pay any Deficiency
Amount pursuant to Section 1.09(i)). The amount to be paid to each Member

such Person, the amount set forth in the applicable payoff letter, invoice or
other documentation;

(iv) deliver a certificate signed by an authorized officer of each Parent, on

(vi) pay or cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,

minus (ix) the Escrow Amount, and if the Effective Time occurs on or before

provided, however, that no amounts shall be duplicated in the calculation of
any of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Remaining 2017 Project
Reimbursement Amount, the Closing Development Expenditure Amount and/or the
Closing Long Lead-Time Assets Reimbursement Amount.

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, the
Company and the Majority Member shall prepare and deliver to the Parent
Representative the Distribution Waterfall and a statement (the "Pre-Closing
Statement") setting forth (i) the Company's estimate of Working Capital, (ii)
the Company's estimate of the Remaining 2017 Project Reimbursement Amount,
(iii) the Company's estimate of the Development Expenditure Amount, (iv) the
Company's estimate of the Long Lead-Time Assets Reimbursement Amount, and (v)
the Company's estimate of the Transaction Expenses, in each case, as of the

calculated using the amounts set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement. The
Merger Consideration so calculated shall be subject to adjustment after the
Closing Date, if any, pursuant to Section 1.09(i); provided, however, that no
such adjustment shall affect the finality or effects of the Merger, and shall
only entitle the Parties to the rights to such adjustment under Section
1.09(i). The Pre-Closing Statement shall be accompanied by the updated
Remaining 2017 Project Budget, copies of the documents described in clauses

Budget, the updated Development Budget, the updated Long Lead-Time Assets
Budget, an updated Schedule 1.01(h) and an updated Schedule 1.01(k).

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Parent Representative
shall prepare and deliver to the Majority Member a statement (the "Statement")
setting forth (i) the Working Capital ("Closing Working Capital"), (ii) the
Remaining 2017 Project Reimbursement Amount (the "Closing Remaining 2017
Project Reimbursement Amount"), (iii) the Development Expenditure Amount (the
"Closing Development Expenditure Amount"), (iv) the Long Lead-Time Assets
Reimbursement Amount (the "Closing Long Lead-Time Assets Reimbursement
Amount"), and (v) the Transaction Expenses (the "Closing Transaction
Expenses"), in each case, as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Closing Consideration").

(d) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the
thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless the Majority Member in
good faith gives written notice of its bona fide disagreement with the
Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to the Parent Representative prior to
such date. Any Notice of



-8-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement so asserted, (ii) only include disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on the Closing Consideration not being calculated
in accordance with this Section 1.09 and the other applicable provisions of
this Agreement, and (iii) be accompanied by a certificate of the Majority
Member that it has complied with Section 1.09(j). The Majority Member may not
supplement the Notice of Disagreement after such thirtieth (30th) day without
the Parent Representative's prior written consent, which may be given or
withheld in its sole discretion. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by
the Parent Representative in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised
in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon the
Majority Member and Parents on the earlier of (A) the date the Majority Member
and the Parent Representative resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to the matters properly specified by the Majority Member in the
Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally
resolved by the Accounting Firm. During the twenty (20) day period following
the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Majority Member and the Parent
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they
have with respect to the matters specified by the Majority Member in the
Notice of Disagreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Federal
Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to any discussions related to the
disputed matters between the Parent Representative and the Majority Member
during such twenty (20) day period, including any subsequent disputes arising
therefrom. At the end of such twenty (20) day period, the Majority Member and
the Parent Representative shall immediately submit to an independent
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm") for resolution of any and all matters
that were included by the Parent Representative in the Notice of Disagreement
and that then remain in dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be such nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in
writing by the Majority Member and the Parent Representative (such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(e) In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 1.09(d), the
Accounting Firm (i) shall make its final determination on all matters within

or Parents shall have any ex parte conversations or meetings with the
Accounting Firm (other than conversations or meetings solely involving the
submission of a request for documents or information by the Accounting Firm to
such party) without the prior consent of the Majority Member, or the Parent
Representative, as applicable. The determinations of the Accounting Firm shall
be final, binding and conclusive, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error.
The cost of any dispute resolution (including the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the Parties)
pursuant to this Section 1.09 shall be borne by the Majority Member (including
from the Majority Member Reserve Fund), on the one hand, and Parents, on the
other hand, as shall be determined by the Accounting Firm such that the
Majority Member (including from the Majority Member Reserve Fund) shall bear
the costs in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items
submitted to the Accounting Firm which were resolved in Parents' favor bears
to the total amount of disputed items submitted to the Accounting Firm, with
Parents bearing the remainder, if any, which proportionate allocations shall
also be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

(i) The "Final Merger Consideration" shall be calculated by recalculating the
Merger Consideration calculated and paid on the Closing Date using the Closing
Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.09. If
the Final Merger Consideration is more than the Merger Consideration
calculated and paid on the Closing Date, Parents shall, within five (5)
Business Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties,
make payment by wire transfer, to accounts designated by the Majority Member
for the ratable benefit (in accordance with each Member's Allocable Share) of
and further distribution to each Member, other than the MIP, if the Effective
Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, in immediately available funds, of
the amount of such difference (the "Excess Amount"), which funds shall be
allocated among the Members by the Majority Member in proportion to each
Member's Allocable Share. If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the
Merger Consideration calculated and paid on the Closing Date, the Majority
Member shall, within five (5) Business Days after the Statement becomes final
and binding on the Parties, make payment by wire transfer, to an account or
accounts designated by the Parent Representative, in immediately available
funds of the amount of such difference (the "Deficiency Amount"), which
payment may be made in whole or in part from the Majority Member Reserve Fund.

(j) In connection with the determination of Closing Consideration pursuant to
this Section 1.09:

(i) during the ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Majority
Member shall assist, and shall direct the other Members to assist, the

Parent Representative in the preparation of the Statement, and the Parent
Representative shall provide the Majority Member reasonable access (at the
requesting party's sole cost and expense) during normal business hours to the
personnel, properties, books and Records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of assisting with and
reviewing the Statement;

(ii) from the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Merger Consideration contemplated by this Section 1.09, Parents shall not take
any action with respect to the accounting books and Records of the Company on
which the Statement is to be based that is not consistent with the Company's
past practices that would materially impact the Statement; and

(iii) from the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to the
Merger Consideration contemplated by this Section 1.09, Parents shall afford,
and shall cause the Company to afford, the Majority Member and its independent
accountants reasonable access (at the requesting party's sole cost and
expense) to the personnel, properties, books and Records of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of
reviewing the adjustments contemplated by this Section 1.09.

(k) A Party claiming that any other Party has failed to comply with its
obligations under Section 1.09(j) to provide access to information may
initiate the appointment of the Accounting Firm by making a written request
directly to the Accounting Firm. If the Majority Member or the Parent
Representative initiates the appointment of the Accounting Firm under this
Section 1.09(k), the Accounting Firm shall have the authority (i) to determine
if a Party has complied with its obligations to provide access to the
information required pursuant to Section 1.09(j) and to order that a Party
comply with any such obligations, (ii) to extend any deadlines set forth in
this Section 1.09, including the immediate temporary suspension of such
deadlines during the time period necessary to resolve the disputed issue, and
(iii) to allow the Majority Member or the Parent Representative the right to
amend any prior Statement or Notice of Disagreement where it finds that such
Party had been prejudiced by the failure to have been provided access to such
information.

(l) The pendency of a dispute shall not affect the payment obligation of
Parents or the Majority Member under Section 1.09(i) to the extent of any
undisputed portion of any payment to be made by the Parties under this Article
I after the Closing. If any portion of the payment is disputed under this
Section 1.09, the Final Merger Consideration shall be calculated on a
preliminary basis using only the undisputed items,

and to the extent the Final Merger Consideration so calculated is greater than
or less than the portion of the Merger Consideration applicable to such
undisputed items, then the applicable payment shall be made on a preliminary
basis pursuant to Section 1.09(i) within five (5) Business Days after the
undisputed items have become final. If a preliminary payment is made pursuant
to this Section 1.09(l), then, upon final resolution of the Closing
Consideration, the payment then required to be made in accordance with Section
1.09(i) shall be made, without duplication, after giving effect to the
preliminary payment so paid.

the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) the

efforts to collect any such Interconnection Deposit Refunds during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the eighteen (18) month
anniversary thereof.

amount of such PPA Deposit Refund, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Majority Member (which funds shall then
be allocated among the Members by the Majority Member in accordance with their
respective Allocable Shares, other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs
on or before October 31, 2017). The Surviving LLC shall, and Parents shall
cause the Surviving LLC to, use its reasonable best efforts to collect any
such PPA Deposit Refunds during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the twelve (12) month anniversary thereof.

(d) From and after the Closing, Parents shall (or shall cause the Surviving
LLC to) promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days after the
receipt thereof (or such longer period of time as a claim for payment from the
Majority Member that is subject to offset under Section 1.13 is outstanding),
pay to one or more accounts designated by the Majority Member by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (for the ratable benefit of the Members in
accordance with their respective Allocable Shares, other than the MIP),
without duplication, the gross amount of any cash proceeds (including proceeds
received in connection with the release of any escrow or holdback amount or
the payment of any contingent, earn-out or delayed consideration, in each
case, to the extent such amounts are not reflected in Closing Working Capital)
actually received after the Closing by the Surviving LLC or a Company
Subsidiary in connection with the UK Transaction and the Land Sale.

(e) If, (i) the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017 and (ii)
at any time following the Closing, the Put Right is exercised, then promptly
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after such exercise, Parents
shall (or shall cause the Surviving LLC to) pay to the Majority Member (for
the ratable benefit of the Members in accordance with their respective
Allocable Shares, other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before
October 31, 2017), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated by the Majority Member, an amount in cash equal to
one percent (1%) of the MIP Amount. If instead the Call Right is exercised,
the preceding payment shall not be required.

(f) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
date on which no funds remain in Finance-Based Escrows (as defined in Schedule
1.01(e)), within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of any Finance-Based
Escrowed Cash (as defined in Schedule 1.01(e)), the Surviving LLC shall, and
Parents shall cause the Surviving LLC to, pay to the Majority Member (ratably
for the benefit of and further distribution to all of the Members, other than
the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) the
aggregate amount of any Finance-Based Escrowed Cash returned to the Surviving
LLC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account

designated by the Majority Member (which funds shall then be allocated among
the Members by the Majority Member in accordance with their respective
Allocable Shares, other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before
October 31, 2017). The Surviving LLC shall, and Parents shall cause the
Surviving LLC to, use its reasonable best efforts to seek the return of
Finance-Based Escrowed Cash as promptly as practical.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that (i) the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, (ii)
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, funds are paid to the Majority Member
subsequent to the Closing for allocation among the Members and (iii) at the
time that such payment is made, neither the Put Right nor the Call Right have
been exercised, then the MIP's Allocable Share (calculated as if the Effective
Time had occurred on November 1, 2017) of such payment shall be paid to the
Company instead of being paid to the Majority Member, and shall be included in
the applicable redemption price set forth in the Surviving Limited Liability
Company Agreement in the event that the Put Right or Call Right are thereafter
exercised by the MIP. In the event that (i) the Effective Time occurs on or
before October 31, 2017, (ii) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, funds
are paid to the Majority Member subsequent to the Closing for allocation among
the Members and (iii) at the time that such payment is made, the Put Right or
Call Right had already been exercised, then the Majority Member shall pay to
the MIP an amount equal to the MIP's Allocable Share (without giving effect to
the proviso in the definition thereof) of such payment. To avoid duplication,
amounts paid in respect of the MIP's Allocable Share under this Section
1.10(g) shall reduce the amounts otherwise payable to the Majority Member
under the other provisions of this Section 1.10.

Section 1.11. Letter of Transmittal.

of transmittal that is in customary form and acceptable in form and substance
to the Majority Member and the Parent Representative (such acceptance not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the "Letter of
Transmittal").

(b) With respect to any Member (other than the MIP, if the Effective Time
occurs on or before October 31, 2017, and the Majority Member) who does not
deliver a duly completed Letter of Transmittal to the Majority Member on or
prior to the Closing Date, promptly (but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days) following such Member's delivery to the Majority Member of a
duly completed Letter of Transmittal, the Majority

Member shall pay to such Member its Allocable Share of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall.

Section 1.12. Paying Agent Matters. At any time following the two (2) year
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Parent Representative shall be entitled
to require the Majority Member to deliver to the Surviving LLC any portion of
the Merger Consideration that had been paid to the Majority Member at the
Closing and which has not been disbursed to the Members (unless such amount is
the subject of a dispute between any Parties), and thereafter, such Members
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving LLC (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Applicable Laws), as general creditors
thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration, that would
otherwise be payable upon the delivery of the Letter of Transmittal by each
such Member, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by each such Member at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Laws, the property of Parents, free and clear of all claims or interests of
any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Majority Member, Parents or the Surviving LLC shall be liable to any
direct or indirect former Member (or any successor or assignee thereof) for
any portion of the Merger Consideration or interest thereon properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Applicable Law.

Section 1.13. Offset. In the event that the Majority Member (on behalf of
itself or the other Members, other than the MIP if the Effective Time occurs
on or before October 31, 2017) is required to pay the Surviving LLC (or the
Parent Representative or Parents, if applicable) any amount pursuant to
Section 1.09 or Section 1.10, and the Majority Member does not pay any such
amount to the Surviving LLC (or the Parent Representative or Parents, if
applicable) from the Majority Member Reserve Fund within fifteen (15) days
after the Majority Member receives a written request for payment from the
applicable Party, then Parents (on behalf of themselves and the Surviving LLC)
shall be entitled to deduct and offset any such amount from or against any
amount that either Parent or the Surviving LLC may be required to pay to the
Majority Member (ratably for the benefit of and further distribution to all of
the Members in accordance with their respective Allocable Shares, other than
the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) pursuant
to Section 1.09 or Section 1.10.

investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the

or Liability of any kind, which would prevent the payment of funds necessary

correct and complete copies of executed equity commitment letters dated as of
the



-40-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





Effective Date (the "Equity Commitment Letters") pursuant to which certain
equity investors identified therein have committed, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions thereof, to invest funds in Parents as set forth therein
(the "Equity Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letters provide that the
Company is an express third party beneficiary thereof and the Company is
entitled to enforce such Equity Commitment Letters, in each case, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof.

(b) Each of the Equity Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and has
not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect, no such amendment, supplement or modification that is
or would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company is contemplated
and the respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. There are no other Contracts,
agreements, side letters or arrangements to which either Parent or any of

Equity Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the applicable Parent Affiliate party thereto, except as
such enforceability may be subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. No event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of either Parent or any Affiliate
of either Parent that is party thereto under any term, or a failure of any
condition, of the Equity Commitment Letters, or otherwise result in any
portion of the Equity Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable or
delayed. There are no conditions precedent relating to the funding of the full
amount of the Equity Financing, other than as set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letters. None of Parents or Merger Subs have reason to believe that
any of them could be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition
of the Equity Commitment Letters required to be satisfied by them.

(c) The net proceeds of the Equity Financing, when funded in accordance with
the Equity Commitment Letters, will be, in the aggregate, as of the Closing
Date, sufficient to enable Parents to consummate the Transactions as
contemplated hereby and pay any fees and expenses incurred by Parents and
Merger Subs in connection with the Transactions. None of Parents or Merger
Subs has incurred, and will not incur as of the Closing Date, any obligation,
commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, which would impair or
adversely affect, other than in a de minimis manner, either Parent's or either
Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Transaction and pay all related
transaction expenses as contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) With respect to Parent II and Merger Sub II, (i) this Agreement and the
Transactions are commercial rather than public or governmental acts and
neither Parent II nor Merger Sub II is entitled to claim immunity from legal
proceedings with respect

to itself or any of its assets on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise
under any applicable laws or in any jurisdiction where an action may be
brought for the enforcement of any of the obligations arising under or
relating to this Agreement and (ii) to the extent that either Parent II or
Merger Sub II or any of its respective assets has or hereafter may acquire any
right to immunity from set-off, legal proceedings, attachment prior to
judgment, other attachment or execution of judgment on the grounds of
sovereignty or otherwise, each of Parent II and Merger Sub II hereby
irrevocably waives such rights to immunity in respect of its obligations
arising under or relating to this Agreement.

claim pending or, to the Knowledge of Parents, threatened in writing, to which
either Parent or either Merger Sub is a party, in any such case at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority or arbitral body, against or
affecting either Parent or either Merger Sub which would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the Effective Date, none of Parents or Merger
Subs is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any

provided, however, that in the event that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries would be prohibited from taking any action by reason of this
Section 5.01(a) without the prior written consent of the Parent
Representative, such action may nevertheless be taken without such consent if
the Company requests the Parent Representative's written consent and the
Parent Representative fails to respond in writing or fails to withhold its
consent to such request within five (5) Business Days after the date of such
request (time being of the essence). Notwithstanding anything in this Section
5.01(a) to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either
Parent or either Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over their respective operations.

(b) Development Funding. During the period prior to the Closing, the Majority
Member shall cause the Company to be funded by cash contributions (as
necessary) such that the Company has sufficient funds in order to make the
expenditures contemplated by the Development Budget in all material respects
unless otherwise consented in writing by the Parent Representative.

(c) Modification of Disclosure Schedules. During the period between the
Effective Date and the Closing Date, the Company shall have the right to
modify its Disclosure Schedules to describe any action taken during such
period by the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is either required by or
not prohibited by Section 5.01(a). The Company shall provide Parents with
copies of any such modification. For purposes of Article VI, Article VII and
Article IX, the Company shall be deemed to have made any such disclosure to
Parents in this Agreement as of the Effective Date.

(d) Notice of Certain Events. From the Effective Date until the Closing, the
Company shall promptly notify the Parent Representative in writing (i) of any
circumstance, occurrence, event, action or inaction relating to the Majority
Member, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, the existence, occurrence,
non-occurrence, or taking of or not taking of which has resulted or would
reasonably be expected to result (whether with notice, the passage of time or
both) in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or
Section 6.02 to be satisfied, (ii) of any bona fide written notice from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is required in connection with
the Transactions where such consent would constitute a Company Required
Consent or a Majority Member Required Consent, (iii) of any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Authority which (x)
challenges the Transactions, or (y) unless such notice is separately required
under Section 5.03, requests material or non-public information relating to
the Transactions, in the case of clauses (x) and (y),

pursuant to Applicable Law and (iv) if the aggregate expenditures made by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the Remaining 2017
Projects exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Remaining 2017 Project
Budget delivered by the Company to Parents on the Effective Date. From the
Effective Date until the Closing, the Parent Representative shall promptly
notify the Company and the Majority Member in writing of (A) any circumstance,
occurrence, event, action or inaction relating to either Parent or either
Merger Sub the existence, occurrence, non-occurrence, or taking of or not
taking of, which has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result
(whether with notice, the passage of time or both) in the failure of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 to be satisfied, (B)
any bona fide written notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is required in connection with the Transactions where such consent
would constitute a Parent Required Consent and (C) unless such notice is
separately required under Section 5.03, any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Authority which challenges the
Transactions. No notice under this Section 5.01(d) shall be deemed to have
modified any representation and/or warranty or cured any breach of covenant
for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VI or a Party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article
VII; provided, however, if a notice delivered to the Parent Representative
pursuant to this Section 5.01(d) discloses matters that would give the Parent
Representative the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(a)(iv) and the Parent Representative does not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement under Section 7.01(a)(iv) in respect of any and all
matters disclosed pursuant to any such notice within ten (10) Business Days
after the Parent Representative's receipt thereof, then Parents and Merger
Subs shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement or otherwise, including under Section 7.01(a)(iv), with
respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant to such notice. From the
Effective Date until the Closing, if either Parent or either Merger Sub is
aware of any occurrence, event, action or inaction the existence, occurrence,
nonoccurrence or taking of or not taking of which (x)(i) has resulted or would
reasonably be expected to result (whether with notice, the passage of time or
both) in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 or
Section 6.02 to be satisfied, or (ii) which would give the Parent
Representative the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(a)(iv), and (y)(i) of which the Company and the Majority Member had no
Knowledge prior to the Effective Date or (ii) which occurrence, event, action
or inaction first occurred (or did not occur, as the case may be) following
the Effective Date, and in each case, the Parent Representative fails to
deliver written notice to the Majority Member disclosing such matter in
reasonable detail within twenty (20) calendar days of the applicable Parent or
Merger Sub becoming aware thereof, then Parents and Merger Subs shall be
deemed to have waived any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(a)(iv) in connection with such matter, and such matter

shall in no event be deemed to give rise to a breach or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement given or made by the Company
or the Majority Member in this Agreement and shall not be considered for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
Article VI.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each Party shall use

of the FPA, with respect to the Transactions promptly (and in any event,
within ten (10) Business Days) after the Effective Date and shall supply as

additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to Competition Laws and/or by FERC, as the case may be. Subject to Applicable
Law and the terms hereof, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating
to Proceedings under any Competition Laws or with FERC and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority with respect to any
such filing. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, but
subject to the terms hereof, unless prohibited by Applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority, the Parties shall (i) give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) to the extent reasonably

drafts of all proposed written communications with the Governmental Authority
and consider in good faith the comments of the other Party on such draft, and
(v) otherwise keep the other Party reasonably apprised with respect to any
communications with any Governmental Authority regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions. Any such disclosures or provisions of information by one Party
to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
Applicable Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information.
In addition to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, a Party may request
entry into a joint defense agreement as a condition to providing any materials
and that, upon receipt of that request, the Parties shall work in good faith
to enter into a joint defense agreement to create and preserve attorney-client
privilege in a form and substance mutually acceptable to the Parties. In
addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, any materials furnished by
Parents or the Company to the other Party pursuant to this Section 5.03(a) may
be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company
or (y) as is reasonably necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
other confidentiality obligations or Applicable Law or to address reasonable
attorney-client or other reasonable privilege concerns.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) none of Parents, Merger Subs, the
Company, the Majority Member and their respective Affiliates shall elect to
extend any waiting period or comparable period under Competition Laws or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Majority Member or
the Parent Representative, as applicable, and (ii) Parents and Merger Subs
agree to take (and Parents' and Merger Subs' "reasonable best efforts" shall
expressly include) all actions that are reasonably necessary or advisable or
as may be required or reasonably requested by any Governmental Authority to
expeditiously (and in no event later than the Outside Date) consummate the
Transactions, including offering, negotiating, committing to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture,
termination, license or other disposition of any and all of the membership
interest, capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights (including any rights or Contracts to acquire
Equity Interests or assets, other than pursuant to this Agreement), products
or businesses of Parents and Merger Subs (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on
the other hand, and (B) any other restrictions on the activities of Parents
and Merger Subs (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one
hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand;
provided, however, subject to Section 7.01(a)(vii), that nothing hereunder
shall require the Company (or the Surviving LLC) or either Parent or any of
its equity owners or its or their Affiliates to divest any assets, including
generation assets, or take any other action which would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the

business, results of operations, financial condition of the Surviving LLC or
on the benefits expected by Parents from the Merger.

(c) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other Person
is threatened or commenced which questions the validity or legality of the
Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such Proceeding
and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such Proceeding, to use
reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted, and to
cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
Transactions.

(d) From and after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts, and Parents shall reasonably cooperate with
the Company, to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable following the the
Effective Date the Consents from third parties required in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions which are set forth in Section 5.03(d)(i) of
the Disclosure Schedules or such other amendments in connection with any Lease
required in connection with the consummation of the Transactions which are set
forth in Section 5.03(d)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules (each, a "Third Party
Consent"). The Majority Member shall cooperate with the Company in obtaining
the Third Party Consents under this Section 5.03(d). The Company shall bear
the costs, fees and expenses (including any license or other fees and
expenses) associated with obtaining the Third Party Consents and, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including in Section 5.03(a))
all other third party Consents required in connection with the Transactions;
provided that, (i) with respect to the Tax Equity Documents referenced in
Section 5.03(d)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules, the costs, fees and expenses
(including any license or other fees and expenses) associated with obtaining
the Third Party Consents and all other third party Consents required in
connection with the Transaction or in connection with any waivers required in
order to avoid the consummation of the Transactions from resulting in a breach
under any Tax Equity Document or in connection with other concessions or
consents (other than indemnities, sureties, hold harmless and similar
arrangements) requested, prior to consummation of and in connection with the
Transactions, by a counterparty thereto in connection with a Tax Equity
Document in connection with the Transactions (collectively, the "Consent
Fees") shall be allocated among the Parties as set forth on Section
5.03(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedules; and (ii) the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts, and Parents shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company, to obtain as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, all of the Consents, waivers and concessions referenced in the
immediately preceding clause (i). The Parties agree that the Company shall be
responsible for paying all Consent Fees at or prior to the Closing, and
Parents shall satisfy their obligation to share such Consent Fees by reducing
Transaction Expenses by the



-52-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





amount of Consent Fees for which Parents have responsibility pursuant to this
Section 5.03(d). The Company shall consult with Parents and keep Parents
reasonably informed of the status of all Third Party Consents and, with
respect thereto, the Company shall consult with Parents and, with respect to a
Tax Equity Document, cooperate to reasonably balance in good faith the Consent
Fees with any indemnification obligations requested or required in connection
with obtaining such Third Party Consents. Prior to the Closing, Parents and
their respective Affiliates shall not initiate lawsuits against the Persons
set forth on Section 5.3(d)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedules except in good
faith and in connection with matters unrelated to the Transactions. In no
event shall the Majority Member be required to provide, execute, deliver or in
any way become obligated for, an indemnity, hold harmless, surety or other
similar instrument, or responsible for any payments under any of the foregoing
instruments which may be delivered in connection with any indemnification
obligations requested or required in connection with obtaining Third Party
Consents or in connection with any waivers required in order to avoid the
consummation of the Transactions from resulting in a breach under a Tax Equity
Document or in connection with other concessions or consents requested in
connection with a Tax Equity Document in connection with the Transactions.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 5.03,
each of the Company, Parents and Merger Subs agree to use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Clearance. Such reasonable best efforts shall
include, promptly after the Effective Date, making or causing to be made any
draft and final CFIUS Notices required in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800
and the other requirements of the DPA, and after prompt resolution of all
questions and comments received from CFIUS on such draft, preparing and
submitting the final CFIUS Notice, which shall in any event be made promptly
after the date all questions and comments received from CFIUS on such draft
have been resolved or after CFIUS staff shall have indicated to the Parties
that it has no questions or comments. Such reasonable best efforts shall also
include providing any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or
branch of the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review or
investigation of the Transactions, within the time periods specified by 31
C.F.R. §800.403(a)(3), or otherwise specified by the CFIUS staff, without the
need to request an extension of time. Each of Parents and Merger Subs, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the
efforts to obtain the CFIUS Clearance: (i) cooperate in all respects and
consult with each other in connection with the CFIUS Notice, including by
allowing the other Parties to have a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance and comment on drafts of filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform
the other Parties of any communication received by such Parties from, or given
by such Parties to, CFIUS, by promptly providing copies to the other Parties
of any such written

* * *





communications, except for any exhibits to such communications providing the
personal identifying information required by 31 C.F.R. §800.402(c)(6)(vi); and
(iii) permit the other Parties to review in advance any communication that it
gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting, telephone
call or conference with CFIUS, and to the extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give
the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in any telephonic
conferences or in-person meetings with CFIUS, in each of clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) of this Section 5.03(e), subject to confidentiality considerations
contemplated by the DPA or required by CFIUS. With respect to Parents and
Merger Subs, such reasonable best efforts shall also include agreeing to any
action, condition or restriction required by CFIUS in connection with the
CFIUS Clearance (including entering into any mitigation agreement with CFIUS
as may be required) in order to receive the CFIUS Clearance as promptly as
reasonably practicable, unless (x) the Majority Member and the Parent
Representative have irrevocably waived the condition set forth in Section
6.01(c) prior to such date or (y) the terms of such action, condition or
restriction (including as required in any mitigation agreement with CFIUS)
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, results of operations, financial condition of the Company, the
ability of Parent II (or any equityholder of Parent II) to participate in the
management or governance of the Company or the ability of Parent II (or any
equityholder of Parent II) or Merger Sub II to access the Company (including
without limitation access to the Company's personnel, facilities, systems,
records, data, intellectual property, technology, vendors or customers) or
require a material change to, or cause a material restriction on, the
businesses of any equityholders of Parent II or its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in the event that CFIUS notifies Parents and the Company that CFIUS
(A) has completed its review or investigation and determined it has unresolved
national security concerns and (B) intends to send a report to the President
of the United States requesting the President's decision because it either (1)
recommends that the President act to suspend or prohibit the Transactions, (2)
is unable to reach a decision on whether to recommend that the President
suspend or prohibit the Transactions, or (3) requests that the President make
a determination with regard to the Transactions (each of the events in clauses
(1), (2) and (3), a "CFIUS Turndown"), the Majority Member and the Parent
Representative may jointly request a withdrawal of the notice filed with CFIUS
in connection with the CFIUS Clearance and none of Parents, Merger Subs or the
Company shall have any further obligation to seek CFIUS Clearance. None of
Parents, Merger Subs or the Company shall take or permit any of their
respective Affiliates to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the receipt of the CFIUS
Clearance. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section
5.03(e) constitute the sole obligations of the Parties with respect to the
efforts required to obtain CFIUS Clearance.

including the related footnotes, as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016 (the "2016 Audited Financial Statements") promptly upon completion of
such 2016 Audited Financial Statements; provided that in no event shall a
failure to deliver, or to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, the
2016 Audited Financial Statements prior to the Closing in and of itself be
deemed a failure of any condition to Closing set forth in Article VI.

Section 5.05. Expenses; Transfer Taxes.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, all costs, fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost, fee or expense,
including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to Section 5.06.

(b) All sales Taxes, use Taxes, transfer Taxes, filing fees and similar Taxes,
fees, charges and expenses ("Transfer Taxes") required to be paid in
connection with the Transactions shall be borne by Parents; provided, however,
that if the Transfer Taxes exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000),
Parents, on the one hand, and the Majority Member (including from the Majority
Member Reserve Fund), on the other hand, shall share equally the Transfer
Taxes exceeding such threshold. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from Transfer Taxes, and
to cooperate with the other Parties in providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions.

Section 5.06. Tax Matters.

(a) Allocation. The allocation of the Consideration among the assets of the
Company shall be determined in the following manner:

(i) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the Parent
Representative shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and shall deliver to
the Majority Member a statement allocating the Merger Consideration and the
aggregate amount of any Liabilities treated as having been assumed by Parents
for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes as a result of the Merger (in each case,
as determined under applicable income tax principles) (the "Consideration")
among the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is treated
as a "flow through" for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes (the "Preliminary
Allocation

Statement") in accordance with Sections 338, 755 and 1060 of the Code and
applicable Treasury Regulations.

(ii) If the Majority Member disagrees with the Preliminary Allocation
Statement, then it shall deliver a notice of such disagreement to the Parent
Representative within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Parent
Representative's delivery of the Preliminary Allocation Statement. Any such
notice shall specify those items or amounts as to which the Majority Member
disagrees, and the Majority Member shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items and amounts contained in the Preliminary Allocation Statement.

(iii) After delivery of a notice of disagreement pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Parent Representative and the Majority Member shall negotiate, in
good faith, for ten (10) Business Days and shall endeavor to agree on all
otherwise unagreed items or amounts with respect to the Preliminary Allocation
Statement.

(iv) If the Parent Representative and the Majority Member are unable to agree
on all items or amounts pursuant to clause (iii) above, then the Parent
Representative and the Majority Member shall submit to an independent
accounting firm (the "Tax Matters Accounting Firm") for resolution all
remaining disagreements with respect to the Preliminary Allocation Statement.
The Preliminary Allocation Statement shall be revised to reflect the
determinations of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm, if any, together with items
and amounts as to which Majority Member and the Parent Representative had
previously agreed (or were deemed to agree) (as so revised, the "Final
Allocation Statement"). The Tax Matters Accounting Firm shall be such
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon in writing by the Majority Member and the Parent Representative (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(v) In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to this Section 5.06(a), the
Tax Matters Accounting Firm (A) shall make its final determination on all
matters within ninety (90) days of its appointment and (B) with respect to
each matter submitted to it, shall not resolve such matter in a manner that is
more favorable (x) to the Members than the notice of disagreement prepared by
the Majority Member pursuant to clause (ii) or (y) to Parents than the
Preliminary Allocation Statement prepared by the Parent Representative. Only
disputed items shall be submitted to the Tax Matters Accounting Firm for
review. The final determination by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm of the

matter submitted to it pursuant to Section 5.06(a)(iv) and (4) include a brief
summary of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm's reasons for its determination of
each issue. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Tax Matters
Accounting Firm in New York State Supreme Court or any other court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees and expenses of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this Section 5.06(a) shall be borne by the Majority Member
(including from the Majority Member Reserve Fund), on the one hand, and
Parents, on the other hand, such that the Majority Member shall bear the costs
in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items submitted to
the Tax Matters Accounting Firm which were resolved in Parents' favor bears to
the total amount of disputed items submitted to the Tax Matters Accounting
Firm, with Parents bearing the remainder, if any, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm at the
time the determination of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm is rendered on the
merits of the matters submitted. The dispute resolution by the Tax Matters
Accounting Firm under this Section 5.06(a) shall constitute an arbitration
under the Federal Arbitration Act, and the determinations of the Tax Matters
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or
manifest error.

(vi) The Parties shall prepare their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the Final Allocation Statement, and shall not take a contrary position on any
other Tax Return, in any audit or in any other communication with any Taxing
Authority, except as required by Applicable Law. The Parties shall cooperate
to adjust the Final Allocation Statement to reflect any adjustments made to
the Consideration after the Closing.

(b) Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. The Majority Member shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all tax periods that end on or before
the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period. Parents and the Company shall permit the
Majority Member to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence prior to filing and shall incorporate such revisions to
such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Majority Member. With
respect to an income Tax Return for a Straddle Period, allocations of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit shall be made using the closing of the books
method pursuant to Section 706 of the Code.

(c) Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any Tax refunds that are received by Parents or
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited



-57-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





against Tax to which Parents or the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
become entitled, that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of the Members, and Parents shall pay over to the Majority Member
(which refunds and amounts shall be allocated among the Members, other than
the MIP if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017, taking
into account each Member's Allocable Share) any such refund or the amount of
any such credit (net of any Taxes of Parents, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries attributable to such refund or credit) within ten (10)
days after receipt thereof.

(d) Working Capital. If the amount included as a Current Liability in
calculating Closing Working Capital on account of all Taxes exceeds the actual
liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for all Taxes, Parents
shall pay, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to pay, to the Majority
Member the amount of any such excess (which excess shall be allocated among
the Members taking into account each Member's Allocable Share) within ten (10)
Business Days after any such excess arises.

(e) Cooperation. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(f) Adjustment. The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 1.09 (except to the extent attributable to interest) as an adjustment
to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law or a final determination by the Tax Matters Accounting Firm
thereunder.

(g) Straddle Periods. In any case under this Agreement involving a Tax period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"),
(i) real, personal and intangible property taxes ("Property Taxes") for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period (provided, however, that for the purposes of apportioning such Straddle
Period Property Taxes the effective date of any adjustment to the rate,
taxability, exemption, or other change upon which such Property Taxes are
computed shall be respected); and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and in the case of any Taxes
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or
other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable



-58-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





Applicable Law), as if the taxable period of such partnership, other
"flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (whether or not such Taxes arise in a Straddle
Period of the applicable owner).

(h) Amended Returns and Retroactive Elections. Parents shall not, and shall
not cause or permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, (i)
amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any tax year ending on or before
the Closing Date or with respect to any Straddle Period, (ii) make or change
any Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect to, or that has
retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or to any Straddle Period,
in each case without the prior written consent of the Majority Member (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (iii)
initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes or otherwise
voluntarily approach a Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes without
the prior written consent of the Majority Member (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(i) Tax Proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
8.04(b), the Parent Representative shall promptly notify the Majority Member
following receipt by the Surviving LLC or any Company Subsidiary of any notice
of audit or other proceeding relating to income Taxes for any Tax Period of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as relevant, that begins prior to the
Closing Date (the "Prior Period Returns"). The Majority Member (or its
assignee), at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to control any
and all audits or other proceedings relating to any Prior Period Return. The
Parent Representative shall have the right to participate in, but not control,
such proceedings. The Majority Member shall not agree to the resolution of any
audit or other proceeding relating to a Prior Period Return that would have an
adverse effect on either Parent, without the Surviving LLC's consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(j) Tax Treatment. The Parties agree that the Mergers shall be treated for all
U.S. Federal income Tax purposes as a sale by each Member (other than the MIP
if the Effective Time occurs on or before October 31, 2017) of a partnership
interest in the Company and a purchase by each of the Parents of a partnership
interest in the Company.

Section 5.07. Employee Matters.

"Continuation Period"), Parents shall, or shall cause the Company and the

Agreement shall be construed as altering or limiting the rights of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to (A) terminate the employment of any Employee,
(B) amend, modify or terminate any compensation or employee benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, subject to the terms of such plan, program,

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) a Continuing Employee's service with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and any of their respective
predecessors) for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of
benefit accruals, other than paid time off, if applicable); provided that no
such recognition of service shall be required to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion, actively-

or Section 5.07(e)(2) of the Disclosure Schedules, (x) solicit for employment,
engagement or hire (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) any such
individual, provided that this clause (x) shall not be deemed to prohibit any

search firms not specifically directed at such individuals, so long as the
Majority Member and its controlled Affiliates have not encouraged or advised
such firm to target any such individual, (y) hire or retain (whether as an
employee, consultant or otherwise) any such individual; provided, however,

specifically the terms and provisions of this Section 5.07(e) in any court of
the United States or in the courts of any state having jurisdiction, or in the

Creamer is not actively engaged in the management of the business of such
Person.

legal counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for the
Majority Member or its Affiliates; provided that the Parties will cooperate to
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, or seek appropriate
waivers or consents, under circumstances in which the restrictions of clause

cause the Surviving LLC and its subsidiaries not to) amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the Charter Documents of the Surviving LLC or any of its
subsidiaries for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any
manner that would cause the indemnification of and advancement of expenses of
former or present managers and officers of the Company to be less favorable
than those contained in the Charter Documents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Majority Member may cause the Company to, at the
Majority Member's sole cost and expense, obtain as of the Closing Date "tail"

any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and no representation or
warranty of either Parent or either Merger Sub contained herein then fails to
be true and correct such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.03(a) or
Section 6.03(b) could not then be satisfied and (2) if the thirty (30) day
period described in clause (B) of this Section 7.01(a)(iv) would expire after

assets, or taking any other action which would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial
condition of the Surviving LLC or on the benefits expected by Parents from the

Section 2.21, Section 3.05 and Section 4.09, (ii) Section 5.02, (iii) Section
5.05(a), (iv) Section 5.08, (v) this Section 7.02, (vi) Section 7.03 and (vii)

Agreement in the event

of such Party's fraud or willful misconduct, or to impair the availability of
the remedy of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.11.

Section 7.03. Certain Fees and Expenses.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Majority Member
pursuant to (i) Section 7.01(a)(ii)(A), if at the time of termination, the
only condition to Closing that has not been satisfied or waived (to the extent
such waiver is not prohibited by Applicable Law and other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing) is Section 6.01(b), or (ii) Section 7.01(a)(vii), Parent I shall
indefeasibly pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Majority Member (for the ratable benefit (in accordance with each Member's
Allocable Share) of the Members in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement)
the Reverse Termination Fee concurrently with such termination, which payment
shall be the sole monetary liability of Parents under this Agreement if this
Agreement is terminated in the circumstances set forth in this Section
7.03(a).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Majority Member
pursuant to (i) Section 7.01(a)(iii), or (ii) Section 7.01(a)(v), and, in each
case, only in the event that neither the Company nor the Majority Member
commences a Proceeding (or asserts within a Proceeding the right) to seek
specific performance or injunctive relief or both pursuant to Section 9.11 to
cause Parents and Merger Subs to consummate the Closing, upon the Majority
Member's written demand to the Parent Representative for payment, Parent I
shall indefeasibly pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Majority Member (for the ratable benefit, in accordance with each Member's
Allocable Share, of the Members in accordance with the Company LLC Agreement)
the Reverse Termination Fee within five (5) Business Days after delivery of
such written demand, which payment shall be the sole monetary liability of
Parents under this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated in the
circumstances set forth in this Section 7.03(b).

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the Reverse
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Members and the Company in the circumstances
in which such amount is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without the agreements in this Section 7.03, the Company and the
Majority Member would not enter into this Agreement, and accordingly, if
Parents



-75-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

fail to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.03 and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Company or the Majority Member commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment against either or both of the Parents
for the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, Parents shall pay to the
Company and the Majority Member, as the case may be, their respective costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such
Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the Reverse Termination
Fee at a rate of interest equal to nine percent (9%) per annum, calculated on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over three hundred sixty (360),
from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of
payment.

take any action or refrain from taking any action in accordance therewith)
shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and

Section 8.02. Indemnification by the Majority Member.

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this
Article VIII, the Majority Member agrees to indemnify Parents, Merger Subs and
their respective Affiliates (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) and each of their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Indemnified Purchaser Entities") and to hold each of them harmless from and
against, any and all Losses suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified
Purchaser Entity (whether directly, pursuant to a claim by a Third Party or
otherwise) arising out of or related to:

(i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the
Company in Article II or by the Majority Member in Article III;

(ii) any breach of any of the covenants or agreements of the Company or the
Majority Member contained in this Agreement (other than the obligations and
covenants set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of Section 5.01(a)(x));

(iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes; or

(iv) the Land Sale, the CADR B Transaction and, subject to Section 8.02(a)(iv)
of the Disclosure Schedules, the UK Transaction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.02,
the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall be entitled to indemnification:

(i) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.02(a)(i), only if the aggregate amount of Losses to all Indemnified
Purchaser Entities with respect to all such claims exceeds four million two
hundred sixty-five thousand dollars ($4,265,000) (the "Threshold"), whereupon
(subject to the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) below) the Indemnified
Purchaser Entities shall not be entitled to indemnification until the
aggregate amount of Losses exceeds the Threshold, and thereafter the
Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall be entitled to indemnification only for
amounts in excess of the Threshold; provided that the Threshold shall not
apply to any indemnification obligation of the Majority Member related to the
Majority Member Fundamental Representations or Company Fundamental
Representations;

(ii) only with respect to individual items where the Losses relating thereto
are in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) (any items less



-77-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





than such threshold shall not be aggregated for the purposes of the
immediately preceding clause (i)); and

(iii) only if such claims are made on or before the expiration of the survival
period pursuant to Section 8.01 for the applicable representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with
respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i), in no
event shall the Indemnified Purchaser Entities be entitled in the aggregate to
recover Losses in excess of the amount of the policy limit under the RandW
Policy, or if the RandW Policy is not obtained, in excess of the Threshold
Amount (the "Cap"); provided that the Cap shall not apply to the Company
Fundamental Representations or the Majority Member Fundamental Representations
or in the case of fraud or willful misconduct; provided, further, that in no
event shall the Indemnified Purchaser Entities be entitled to recover
aggregate Losses under this Agreement in excess of four hundred twenty-six
million five hundred thousand dollars ($426,500,000).

(d) For purposes of calculating the dollar amounts of Losses (other than the
dollar amount of Losses with respect to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.06(a)), to which an Indemnified Purchaser
Entity is entitled pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i), such representation,
warranty or covenant shall not be deemed qualified or limited by, and each of
the following shall be disregarded, any "material," "materially,"
"materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect," "Majority Member Material
Adverse Effect" or other similar materiality qualification or limitation.

(e) Parents acknowledge and confirm that the Indemnified Purchaser Entities
shall solely be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) in
excess of the Retention Amount if Parents procure the effective RandW Policy at
or prior to the Closing and that all Indemnified Purchaser Entities who may be
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(i) shall be entitled to
recover any such Losses from the Majority Member only until the aggregate
amount of all such Losses (taking into account the amount of the Threshold) is
equal to the Retention Amount; provided, however, once the Retention Amount
has been paid or satisfied completely, all Indemnified Purchaser Entities
shall be solely entitled to seek or obtain recovery from the RandW Policy in
relation to Losses or indemnification claims under Section 8.02(a)(i), without
any right to recover from the Majority Member (or any other Member), except,
however, with respect to the Majority Member, for Losses arising out of claims
based upon or arising out of fraud or any willful misconduct of the Majority
Member or the Company, to the extent occurring on or prior to the Closing.
Neither the pendency of a claim, the failure to obtain recovery nor the



-78-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





unavailability of coverage under the RandW Policy, regardless of the reason
therefor, shall result in the Majority Member becoming liable to make an
indemnification payment under Section 8.02(a)(i) once the Retention Amount has
been paid or satisfied completely.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i)
to the extent that Losses to which an Indemnified Purchaser Entity is entitled
to indemnification hereunder also constitute an indemnifiable matter under any
prior acquisition agreement, such Indemnified Purchaser Entity will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain indemnification under such prior acquisition
agreement and (ii) any amounts recovered under such prior acquisition
agreement with respect to a Loss shall reduce, dollar for dollar, the amount
owed by the Majority Member hereunder. Each Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall
take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any
Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably
expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

(g) This Section 8.02 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section
8.01(b).

Section 8.03. Indemnification by Parents and Merger Subs.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
Article VIII, Parents and Merger Subs agree, severally and not jointly, to
indemnify the Members and their respective Affiliates, and each of their
respective managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Seller Entities") and
to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered,
paid or incurred by any such Indemnified Seller Entity (whether directly,
pursuant to a claim by a Third Party or otherwise) and arising out of or
related to any:

(i) breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Parents and
Merger Subs in Article IV; and

(ii) breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Parents or Merger Subs
contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.03,
the Indemnified Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification:

(i) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.03(a)(i), only if the aggregate amount of Losses to all Indemnified Seller
Entities with respect to all such claims exceeds the Threshold, and thereafter
the Indemnified



-79-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification only for amounts in
excess of the Threshold; and

(ii) only if such claims are made on or before the expiration of the survival
period pursuant to Section 8.01 for the applicable representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnified Seller Entities be entitled in the aggregate to
recover Losses in excess of the Cap; provided that the Cap shall not apply to
the Parent Fundamental Representations or in the case of fraud or willful
misconduct; provided, further, that in no event shall the Indemnified Seller
Entities be entitled to recover aggregate Losses under this Agreement in
excess of four hundred twenty-six million five hundred thousand dollars
($426,500,000).

(d) For purposes of calculating the dollar amounts of Losses to which an
Indemnified Seller Entity is entitled pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i), such
representation, warranty or covenant shall not be deemed qualified or limited
by, and each of the following shall be disregarded, any "material,"
"materially," "materiality," "Parent Material Adverse Effect," or other
similar materiality qualification or limitation.

(e) This Section 8.03 is subject to the limitations set forth in Section
8.01(b).

Section 8.04. Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each,
an "Indemnified Entity") believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance
exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Article VIII (whether or not the amount of Losses
relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert
its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a "Claim
Notice") to the party from which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section
8.02 or Section 8.03, as applicable (the party from which indemnification is
sought, the "Indemnifying Entity") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise
to such claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim brought by a
Person not a Party or affiliated with any such Party (a "Third Party"), within
ten (10) Business Days following receipt of written notice of such claim by
such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to
such claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim brought
by a Third Party, as promptly as practicable after the discovery by the
Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such claim for
indemnity; provided that, in each case in clauses (i) and (ii), the failure to
notify or delay in notifying the Indemnifying Entity will



-80-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





not relieve the Indemnifying Entity of its obligations pursuant to this
Article VIII, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Entity is materially
prejudiced as a result thereof. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim and
the basis of such claim in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no claim for indemnification arising out
of a claim relating to Taxes may be asserted unless (x) a Third Party has
actually commenced a lawsuit, action or regulatory proceeding or issued a
written notice of proposed adjustment, assessment or deficiency, in each case,
with respect to the specific matters addressed in such claim and (y) such
claim for indemnification is made in respect of Losses actually realized in
connection with the claim by such Third Party.

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a
claim brought by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to
(i) assume and have sole control over the defense of such claim at its sole
cost and expense (subject to the last sentence of this Section 8.04(b)) and
with its own counsel if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Entity within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Entity; provided that (A) the Indemnifying Entity's
retention of counsel shall be subject to the written consent of the
Indemnified Entity if such counsel creates a conflict of interest under
applicable standards of professional conduct or an unreasonable risk of
disclosure of confidential information concerning an Indemnified Entity, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed and (B)
the Indemnifying Entity shall not be entitled to assume and have control over
such defense if such claim arises in connection with a criminal proceeding
(provided that the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to participate in
such defense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Entity, at
such Indemnifying Entity's sole cost and expense) or if the Indemnified Entity
shall have been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists
between the Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entity in connection with
the defense of such Third Party claim; and (ii) negotiate a settlement or
compromise of such claim; provided that unless (A) such settlement or
compromise (1) includes a full and unconditional waiver and release by the
Third Party of all applicable Indemnified Entities without any cost or
liability of any nature whatsoever to such Indemnified Entities, (2) does not
involve any finding or admission of any violation of Applicable Law or
admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Entity and (3) does not result
in any Lien on any of the assets of, or contain any restriction or condition
that would affect the future conduct of, the Indemnified Entity or its
Affiliates and (B) the Indemnifying Entity shall pay or cause to be paid all
amounts of such settlement or compromise concurrently with the effectiveness
thereof, such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with
the written consent of the Indemnified Entity. If, within thirty (30) days
after receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a
Third Party action or claim, the Indemnifying Entity (i) advises such
Indemnified Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity does not



-81-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





elect to defend, settle or compromise such claim, (ii) is not entitled to
assume and control the defense of such claim or (iii) fails to make such an
election in writing, then such Indemnified Entity may, at its option, defend,
settle or otherwise compromise or pay such claim; provided that any such
settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Entity, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available
to the Indemnifying Entity all information reasonably available to such
Indemnified Entity relating to such claim, except as may be prohibited by
Applicable Law. In addition, the Parties shall render to each other such
assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and
adequate defense of any such claim. The Party in charge of the defense shall
keep the other Parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of the
defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If the
Indemnifying Entity elects to defend any such claim, then the Indemnified
Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity at such Indemnified Entity's
sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnifying Entity assumes the
defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or compromise) any such
claim, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for all
costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Entity in connection with such
defense (or negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if
applicable, that such costs and expenses do not exceed the amount of the
remaining Threshold; provided that such costs and expenses shall be included
in the calculation of the Threshold.

(c) An Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to make claims for indemnification
with respect to losses arising out of or resulting from, or amounts payable
with respect to, the matters set forth in Section 8.02 or Section 8.03, as
applicable; it being understood that in the event an Indemnified Entity shall
have timely delivered notice of any claim pursuant to this Section 8.04, such
claim shall survive until such time as such claim is finally resolved.

Section 8.05. Indemnification Generally.

(a) The amount which the Indemnifying Entity is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity related to the
related Losses (for purposes of clarity, this Section 8.05(a) is not intended
to apply to the RandW Policy). If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the
payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Entity in respect of
Losses (including any Merger Consideration adjustment with respect to the
circumstances giving rise to such payment under this Article VIII) and shall
subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such
Losses, then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying
Entity a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually received. Furthermore, the amount of any Losses that may be subject
to indemnification hereunder (other than Losses that are subject to Section
8.02(a)(i) (other than respect to any Company Fundamental Representations and
Majority Member Representations) and Section 8.03(a)(i) (other than respect to
any Parent Fundamental Representations)) will be net of any Tax benefits
actually realized by any Indemnified Entity as a result of Tax benefits
associated with the circumstances giving rise to the indemnification.

(b) Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by
Section 8.05(a), the Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right of
action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person with
respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

(c) The indemnification provided in this Article VIII shall be the sole and
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Party with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Party.

(d) All Losses shall be determined without duplication of recovery under other
provisions of this Agreement or any other document or agreement delivered in
connection with this Agreement and Losses shall not include any amounts that
were included in the calculation of Working Capital. Without limiting the
generality of the prior sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation under this Article
VIII, only one recovery of Losses shall be allowed, and in no event shall
there be any indemnification or duplication of payments or recovery under
different provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same facts,
conditions or events.



-82-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





(e) For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.09 shall not be considered Losses for
purposes of this Article VIII.

(f) The Parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this Article
VIII as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law or a final determination by the Tax
Matters Accounting Firm thereunder.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
other than with respect to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) and
Section 8.03(a)(i), no Party shall be liable for special, punitive, exemplary,
incidental, consequential or indirect damages, lost profits or Losses
calculated by reference to any multiple of earnings or earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation or amortization (or any other valuation
methodology), whether based on contract, tort, strict liability, other
Applicable Law or otherwise and whether or not arising from the other Party's
sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault for any
matter relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to claims brought by any
Third Party for which any Indemnifying Entity is obligated to indemnify an
Indemnified Entity hereunder.

Section 8.06. Escrow; Indemnification Payments.

(a) Any payment that the Majority Member is obligated to make pursuant to
Section 8.02(a) shall be paid, to the extent that there are sufficient funds
in the Escrow Account, by release of funds to the applicable Indemnified
Purchaser Entity from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent within five (5)
Business Days after the date that notice of any such amounts due and owing is
given in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. For purpose of clarity, the
Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery for the Indemnified
Purchaser Entities for payments from the Majority Member pursuant to Section
8.02(a), other than in the event of any fraud or willful misconduct.

(b) If applicable, on the date that is one (1) Business Day after the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release an
amount, if any, equal to the then current balance of the Escrow Account, minus
the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification by the Indemnified
Purchaser Entities asserted prior to such date but not yet resolved in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the "Unresolved Claims").
The balance in the Escrow Account with respect to any Unresolved Claims shall
be released by the Escrow Agent upon the resolution of any such Unresolved
Claims in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Any payment that Parents are obligated to make pursuant to this Article
VIII shall be paid to the applicable Indemnified Seller Entities by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after
such Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Entity or finally adjudicated to be
payable pursuant to this Article VIII.

ARTICLE IX 
General Provisions

Section 9.01. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by any Party (including by
operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of such Party)
without the prior written consent of Parents and the Majority Member. Unless
otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, no such assignment shall relieve a
Party from its obligations and duties hereunder. Any permitted assignee shall
sign an agreement agreeing to be bound by the obligations and duties
hereunder, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the non-assigning
Party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 9.01 shall be
void ab initio.

Section 9.02. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly provided in
Section 5.11 with respect to directors, managers, officers or authorized

assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

specified. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. Any ambiguities with respect to any provision of
this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or
electronic delivery of original signatures, and in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when such counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered, including by facsimile or other electronic means, to the other
Parties.

Section 9.06. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, along with the Exhibits, Annexes and
Schedules hereto and thereto, contain the entire agreement and understanding
among the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject
matter. None of the Parties shall be liable or bound to any other Party in any
manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such
subject matter except as specifically set forth herein or in the other
Transaction Documents.

Section 9.07. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion
thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof (or the
remaining portion thereof) or the application of such provision to any other
Persons or circumstances. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 9.08. Consent to Jurisdiction. Each Party irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the state courts of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and (b) the United States District Court for the District of the
State of Delaware (and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom), for the
purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or any Transaction. Each Party agrees to commence any
such Proceeding in (i) the Delaware Court of Chancery or (ii) the United
States District Court for the District of the State of Delaware (and the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom). Each Party further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
such Party's respective address set forth or provided

for above shall be effective service of process for any Proceeding in the
State of Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction in this Section 9.08. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or the Transactions in (A) the
Delaware Court of Chancery and (B) the United States District Court for the
District of the State of Delaware (and the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or the Transactions and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. This Section 9.08 shall not apply to any dispute
under Section 1.09 or Section 5.06(a) that is required to be decided by the
Accounting Firm or the Tax Matters Accounting Firm.

Section 9.09. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard
to the conflicts of law principles of such State.

Section 9.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. Each Party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such
other Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.10.

Section 9.11. Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof without proof
of damages or otherwise in the Delaware Court of Chancery or the United States
District Court for the District of the State of Delaware, which shall include
the right of the Company (a) to cause each Parent to fully enforce the terms
of the applicable Equity Commitment Letter to the fullest extent permitted
thereby and by Applicable Law and to thereafter cause the Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and (b) to cause each Parent and each Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions on the terms and subject



-88-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





to the conditions set forth herein and therein. Each of the Parents and Merger
Subs agree not to raise any objection to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to enforce compliance with the covenants and
obligations of such Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement and hereby
waive any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. Neither the Company
nor the Majority Member shall be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with seeking an order to specifically enforce this
Agreement. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 9.11 are in
addition to any other remedy to which the Parties are entitled in accordance
herewith; provided, however, if the Majority Member has requested that Parent
I pay the Reverse Termination Fee, and the Reverse Termination Fee shall have
been indefeasibly paid pursuant to Section 7.03, then neither the Company nor
the Majority Member shall be entitled to specific performance hereunder.

Section 9.12. Amendments and Waivers.

(a) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the Parent Representative and the Majority Member, which amendment,
once so executed, shall be binding on all Parties as though direct signatories
hereto.

(b) At any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law (provided, however, that the Company shall not have any such
rights after the Effective Time): (i) the Majority Member may (A) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any of
Parents and/or Merger Subs, (B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered by Parents and/or Merger Subs pursuant hereto, or (C) waive
compliance by Parents and/or Merger Subs with any of the agreements or with
any conditions to the Company's obligations; and (ii) the Parent
Representative may (A) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the Company or the Majority Member, (B) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or the Majority
Member pursuant hereto, or (C) waive compliance by the Company or the Majority
Member with any of the agreements or with any conditions to Parents' or Merger
Subs' obligations.

Section 9.13. Conflicts; Privilege. Recognizing that Lowenstein Sandler LLP
and Stoel Rives LLP have each acted as legal counsel to the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Majority Member and certain of the Majority Member's
Affiliates prior to the Effective Date, and that Lowenstein Sandler LLP and
Stoel Rives LLP each intend to act as legal counsel to the Majority Member and
its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parents, the



-89-

1440241.11A-WASSR01A - MSW

* * *





Company and each other Member hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its respective Affiliates and the Company Subsidiaries to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with Lowenstein Sandler LLP and/or
Stoel Rives LLP representing the Majority Member or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or the Transactions. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between the Majority Member, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Lowenstein Sandler LLP and/or Stoel Rives LLP, on the other hand, in the
course of the engagement with respect to negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transactions shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to the Majority Member and its Affiliates (and
not the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not have the right to obtain access to any
such communications or to the files of Lowenstein Sandler LLP or Stoel Rives
LLP relating to such engagement from and after the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, (a)
the Majority Member and its Affiliates (and not the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of
Lowenstein Sandler LLP or Stoel Rives LLP in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only the Majority Member and its Affiliates
(and not the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall hold such property
rights and (c) neither Lowenstein Sandler LLP nor Stoel Rives LLP shall have
any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Lowenstein Sandler LLP or
Stoel Rives LLP and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
otherwise. This Section 9.13 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section
9.13 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of
Lowenstein Sandler LLP, as it relates to itself, and Stoel Rives LLP, as it
relates to itself.

Section 9.14. Majority Member Reserve Fund. The Majority Member Reserve Fund
shall be used by the Majority Member to pay expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions by the Majority Member in its
capacity as the Majority Member hereunder and may be used by the Majority
Member to pay the Deficiency Amount or other amounts owed under this
Agreement, if any. Once the Majority Member determines, in its sole reasonable
discretion, that the Majority Member will not incur any additional expenses in
its capacity as the Majority Member in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions and will not incur any further obligation to pay any Deficiency
Amount, then the Majority Member will distribute the remaining unused Majority
Member Reserve Fund, if any, to the Members who have delivered to the Majority
Member



-90-

duly executed Letters of Transmittal, in accordance with each Member's
Allocable Share (in each case, taking into account all prior disbursements to
the Members under this Agreement at and following the Closing); provided that
the Majority Member may not make such discretionary distribution prior to the
determination of the Final Merger Consideration and payment, if any, of the
Excess Amount or the Deficiency Amount.

Section 9.15. Majority Member.

(a) The Majority Member is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act
as representative, for the benefit of all Members, as the exclusive agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of the Members, in connection with and to
facilitate the consummation of the Transactions, which shall include the power
and authority:

(i) to take any and all actions (including executing and delivering any
documents, making any disbursements or distributions, incurring any costs and
expenses for the account of the Members, exercising such rights, power and
authority, and making any and all decisions and determinations required by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents) under this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents, such actions being deemed as taken by
each Member (as applicable) and which shall be absolutely and irrevocably
binding on each Member as if such Member personally or in its corporate
capacity had taken such action, exercised such rights, power or authority or
made such decision or determination in such Member's individual or corporate
capacity, as applicable;

(ii) as the representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the Members and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the
