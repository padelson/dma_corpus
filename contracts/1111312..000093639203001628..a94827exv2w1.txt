                                  ARTICLE III
    MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN THE MERGER

            Section 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or their respective stockholders:

            (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share
of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

            (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock. Each
Company Share held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or owned by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

            (c) Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Section 3.1(d) through
3.1(j) and 3.3(d), each issued and outstanding Company Share (other than Company
Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) hereof and together with
any associated Company Rights) shall automatically be converted into the right
to receive, at the option of the holder as contemplated by Section 3.1(f)
through 3.1(i), either (i) a number of Parent Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the "Stock Consideration") or (ii) an amount in cash equal to $18.00, without
interest (the "Cash Consideration" and together with the Stock Consideration,
the "Merger Consideration"). All Company Shares converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Shares ("Company Certificate") shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other


                                       11
<PAGE>
distributions to which holders of Company Shares become entitled in accordance
with this Article III upon the surrender of such Company Certificate.

            (d) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to,
or rights issued in respect of, Company Shares or Parent Shares, each of the
Exchange Ratio, Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted
accordingly, without duplication, to provide to the holders of Company Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

            (e) Dissenting Company Shares. Company Shares that have not been
voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which appraisal shall
have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder
of such shares withdraws his demand for such appraisal (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes ineligible for such appraisal. If a
holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in accordance with Section 262(k) of
the DGCL) his demand for such appraisal or shall become ineligible for such
appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event,
whichever last occurs, each of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be
a Dissenting Share and shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any payments with respect
to, or compromise or settle, any demand for appraisal without the written
consent of Parent. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholder's right to
dissent from the Merger prior to the Election Date, each of such holder's
Company Shares shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all
purposes of this Article III. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have
failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost such stockholder's right
to dissent from the Merger after the Election Date, each of such holder's
Company Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Stock Consideration
or the Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent,
subject to Section 3.1(j), in its sole discretion.

            (f) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.1, each record
holder of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to
be converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(c) will be entitled to elect
to receive for each Company Share held by such holder either (i) the Stock
Consideration per Company Share ("Stock Election") or (ii) the Cash
Consideration per Company Share ("Cash Election"). Any holder of Company Shares
who fails to properly make a Cash Election or Stock Election and any holder who
fails to submit to the Exchange Agent a properly completed and signed and
properly and timely submitted Form of Election shall be deemed to have indicated
no preference as to the receipt of cash or Parent Shares with respect to such
holder's Company Shares (a "Non-Election") and will receive for such


                                       12
<PAGE>
Company Shares the Merger Consideration described in Section 3.1(g), 3.1(h) or
3.1(i), as applicable.

            (g) If the aggregate number of Company Shares for which cash is
elected under a Cash Election and Dissenting Shares, if any (collectively, the
"Cash Election Shares"), exceeds the Cash Election Number, all Company Shares
for which Stock Consideration was elected under a Stock Election (collectively,
the "Stock Election Shares") and all Company Shares covered by Non-Elections
(the "Non-Election Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration, and the Cash Election Shares (other than Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive cash and Parent Shares in the
following manner: each Cash Election Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive (i) an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Cash
Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of which
shall be the Cash Election Number and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of Cash Election Shares and (ii) a number of Parent Shares equal to
the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the
Cash Fraction.

            (h) If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds the
Stock Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and all
Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive Parent Shares
and cash in the following manner: each Stock Election Share shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of
(A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction (the "Stock Fraction"), the numerator
of which shall be the Stock Election Number and the denominator of which shall
be the total number of Stock Election Shares and (ii) an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Cash
Consideration and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction.

            (i) In the event that neither Section 3.1(g) or 3.1(h) is
applicable, all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration, all Stock Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and all Non-Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) the Cash
Consideration and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Cash
Election Number less the number of Cash Election Shares and the denominator of
which shall be the number of Non-Election Shares, and (B) a number of shares of
Parent Shares equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Stock Election Number less the number of
Stock Election Shares and the denominator of which shall be the number of
Non-Election Shares.

            (j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
maximum number of Company Shares (including Dissenting Shares, if any), that
shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be
equal to that number which corresponds to 20% of the number of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such number rounded to the
nearest whole share, the "Cash


                                       13
<PAGE>
Election Number"); provided, however, that if either (i) the tax opinion
delivered to the Company referred to in Section 7.3(d) cannot be rendered
(including, without limitation, as a result of cash deemed paid in connection
with the withholding described in Section 7.2(f)) (as reasonably determined by
Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, special tax counsel to the Company) or (ii) the tax
opinion delivered to Parent referred to in Section 7.2(h) cannot be rendered
(including, without limitation, as a result of cash deemed paid in connection
with the withholding described in Section 7.2(f)) (as reasonably determined by
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), special tax counsel to Parent),
then the Cash Election Number shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary
to enable the relevant tax opinion or opinions, as the case may be, to be
rendered.

            Section 3.2       Share Election.

            (a) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Date is a record
holder of Company Shares shall have the right, subject to Section 3.1, to submit
a Form of Election specifying (i) the number of Company Shares that such Person
desires to be converted into the Cash Consideration pursuant to the Cash
Election, or (ii) the number of Company Shares that such Person desires to be
converted into the Stock Consideration pursuant to the Stock Election.

            (b) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
record holders of Company Shares, Wells Fargo Shareholder Services, St. Paul,
Minnesota, which currently acts as transfer agent with respect to Parent Shares,
or such other bank, trust company, Person or Persons reasonably acceptable to
the Company, shall be designated by Parent to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for payment of the Merger Consideration.

            (c) Parent, or its authorized agent or representative, shall
prepare a form of election (the "Form of Election"), which Form of Election
shall contain the Letter of Transmittal, for mailing with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The Form of Election shall be (i) mailed to the record
holders of Company Shares as of the record date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting, and (ii) used by each record holder of Company Shares to make either
the Cash Election or the Stock Election, subject to the provisions of Section
3.1. The Company shall also use its reasonable efforts to make the Form of
Election and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons who become
holders of Company Shares during the period between such record date and the
Election Date. Any such holder's election shall have been properly made only if
the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (the
"Election Date") a Form of Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by (i) Company Certificates for the Company Shares to which such
Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable
for transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery of such Company Certificates as set forth on such Form of Election from
a firm which is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15
under the Exchange Act), provided that such Company Certificates are in fact
delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of
delivery) or


                                       14
<PAGE>
(ii) in the case of book-entry shares, any additional documents specified in the
procedures set forth in the Form of Election.

            (d) Any Form of Election may be revoked by a holder of Company
Shares submitting such Form of Election to the Exchange Agent only by written
notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on
the Election Date. In addition, all Forms of Election shall automatically be
revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the Company
that the Merger has been abandoned or if the Company's stockholders fail to
approve the Merger. If a Form of Election is revoked, the Company Certificates
(or guarantees of delivery, if applicable) for the Company Shares, if any, to
which such Form of Election relates shall promptly be returned to the
stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange Agent.

            (e) Parent shall have the sole discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election
have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Parent (or the Exchange
Agent, if applicable) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. None of
Parent, the Company and the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange
Agent. The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by Section
3.1 and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of
Company Shares. The Exchange Agent may, with the mutual written consent of
Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent with Section 3.1 for
the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or
desirable to effect fully such elections.

            (f) If Parent or the Exchange Agent shall determine that any
purported Cash Election or Stock Election was not properly made, such purported
Cash Election or Stock Election shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and
the holder making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election shall for
purposes of this Agreement, be deemed to have made a Non-Election.

            Section 3.3       Exchange of Company Certificates.

            (a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no more than two
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, (i) one or more certificates representing Parent Shares
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Stock Consideration and (ii) cash sufficient
to deliver the aggregate Cash Consideration, cash payable in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(c).

            (b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to (and, if permitted by the
Exchange Agent, to make available for collection in person) each holder of
record of Company Certificates (other than Company Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) that has not timely submitted a properly completed and
executed Form of Election accompanied by an appropriately endorsed Company
Certificate representing all of the


                                       15
<PAGE>
Company Shares owned by that stockholder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery), (i) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal"), a copy of which shall have been provided to the Company prior to
the mailing thereof, that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to Company Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration (which instructions shall provide that
at the election of the surrendering holder, Company Certificates may be
surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by
hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal properly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent the holder of such
Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A)
certificates representing that number of whole Parent Shares, if any, into which
the number of Company Shares previously represented by such Company Certificates
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1 and/or (B) the amount of cash,
if any, into which the number of Company Shares previously represented by such
Company Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1 for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Company Certificate, and Company
Certificates so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange Agent
shall promptly accept such Company Certificates upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. No
interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration (or the cash payable as
described in Section 3.3(c) and (d) below) payable upon the surrender of Company
Certificates for the benefit of, or be paid to, the holders of Company
Certificates.

            (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Shares with a record date at or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the Parent
Shares represented thereby by reason of the conversion of Company Shares
pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.3(d) until
such Company Certificate is surrendered in accordance with this Article III.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Company Certificate, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in
whose name the Parent Shares representing such securities are registered (i) at
the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and
the proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Parent Shares issued
upon conversion of Company Shares, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date or
as promptly as practicable thereafter, the proportionate amount of dividends or
other distributions, with (x) a record date with respect thereto after the
Effective Time, but prior to such surrender, and (y) a payment date subsequent
to such surrender, payable with respect to such Parent Shares.


                                       16
<PAGE>
            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fraction of a
Parent Share will be issued and no dividend or other distribution, stock split
or interest with respect to Parent Shares shall relate to any fractional Parent
Share, and such fractional interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights as a security holder of the Parent Shares. In lieu of any such
fractional Parent Share, each holder of shares of Company Shares otherwise
entitled to a fraction of a Parent Share in accordance with the provisions of
this Article III will be entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a
Parent Share multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a Parent Share on the NYSE
Composite Tape on the Closing Date.

            (e) All Merger Consideration delivered upon the surrender of
Company Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Company Certificate shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration into which Company Shares
theretofore represented by such Company Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to this Article III. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
cash payable upon the surrender of any Company Certificate.

            (f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

            (g) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond or other surety in such
amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made with respect to such Company Certificate and subject to
such other reasonable conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver in exchange for such Company Certificate the Merger
Consideration into which Company Shares theretofore represented by such Company
Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Article III.

            (h) If any payment under this Article III is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any Company Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that Company
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of Company Certificate surrendered or such Person shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.


                                       17
<PAGE>
            (i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any funds held by it for
purposes of this Section 3.3 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis; provided
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively,
or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's
acceptances of commercial banks. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent.

            (j) Parent and/or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to the holders of Company Shares such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal tax law, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such
payment. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holders of Company Shares in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

            (k) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
Any portion of the cash that has been made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.3 that remains unclaimed by the holder of any Company
Certificate six months after the Effective Time, shall be returned to Parent and
any such holder who has not exchanged such holder's Company Certificate prior to
such time shall thereafter look only to Parent for any claim for Merger
Consideration hereunder.

            Section 3.4       Company Stock Options/Purchase Rights.

            (a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company
Shares under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of
the Company (the "Company Option") then outstanding held by each employee of the
Company designated by Parent to be a continuing employee with the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time (each a "Continuing Employee") shall be
replaced by Parent with a substitute option to purchase Parent Shares (a
"Substitute Option"), in an amount and at an exercise price as determined in
accordance with this Section 3.4(a). Parent shall, in its sole discretion,
either (i) file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form (the "Stock Plan Registration Statement") to register the
Parent Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Substitute Options and use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Stock Plan Registration Statement to be
effective at or immediately following the Effective Time or (ii) issue Parent
Shares under an existing registration statement upon the exercise of the
Substitute Options. Each Substitute Option by which any Company Option was
replaced pursuant to this Section 3.4(a) will be subject to, and exercisable and
vested on, comparable terms and conditions as under such Company Option in
effect as of the Effective Time, except that each Substitute Option shall be
exercisable for that number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest number
of whole Parent Shares on a holder-by-holder basis) equal to the number of
Company Shares subject to such Company Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
at an exercise price (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) per Parent Share
equal to the


                                       18
<PAGE>
per share exercise price specified in such Company Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio, and shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, continue to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if
applicable. The treatment of the Company Options provided for in this Section
3.4(a) with respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock
options" (as such term is defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected
in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

            (b) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option
held by anyone other than a Continuing Employee, whether or not exercisable at
the Effective Time and regardless of the exercise price thereof, will be
cancelled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a single lump sum
cash payment, which shall be paid as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, equal to
the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided
that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Cash Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. All payments under this
Section 3.4(b) shall be subject to any applicable withholding tax, as determined
by Parent.

            (c) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain any
necessary consent of each holder of Company Options, to give effect to the
treatment of Company Options pursuant to this Section 3.4; provided that the
Company shall not provide any consideration to holders of Company Options to
obtain their consent without the prior written consent of Parent. If the
treatment contemplated by Section 3.4(b) is not permitted by Law or applicable
Contracts (whether due to the terms thereof or the failure to obtain the
necessary consent) with respect any Company Option held by any Person other than
a Continuing Employee or if necessary to obtain the tax opinions described in
Section 3.1(j), Parent may afford such Company Option the treatment under
Section 3.4(a) or take such other actions with respect to such Company Option as
is permitted under applicable Law.

            (d) The Company shall take all actions necessary to assure that (i)
no participant in the Company's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan increases his
or her rate of payroll deductions, (ii) all outstanding rights under the
Company's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be exercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time on a final purchase date under such plan determined in
accordance with Section 14(c) of such plan and (iii) such plan will terminate
concurrently with such exercise of the outstanding rights thereunder.

bound; or (iii) violate any Order or Law applicable to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets, except, in the case of clause

respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, (i)

with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act and (ii) the Company SEC Documents
themselves. The Company has responded to all comment letters of the Staff of the
SEC relating to the Company SEC Documents, and the SEC has not asserted that any
of such responses are inadequate, insufficient or otherwise non-responsive. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of all correspondence with the SEC occurring since January 1, 2001.

            Section 4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed since December 31, 2002 and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Filed SEC

respective business only in the ordinary course; (b) there has not been any
event or events that has had or could be reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; and (c) neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action contemplated by Section 6.1.

            Section 4.9 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to the extent
disclosed in the Company Filed SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligation of any nature, whether or not
accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to
become due and whether or not required to be disclosed (including any liability
for breach of contract, breach of warranty, torts, infringements, claims or
lawsuits), that could be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            Section 4.10      Benefit Plans; Employees and Employment Practices.

            (a) Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list

since the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor
in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or materially
increase its costs; and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist
and no events have occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualification of any Pension Plan or the related trust. No trust
funding any Benefit Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

            (e) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries has made or entered
into any legally binding commitment (including loans) with, any current or
former directors, officers, employees, consultants or independent contractors of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or of any Commonly Controlled Entity to the
effect that, following the date hereof, (i) any benefits or compensation
provided to such persons under existing Benefit Plans or under any other plan or
arrangement will be enhanced or accelerated, (ii) any new plans or arrangements
providing benefits or compensation will be adopted, (iii) any Benefit Plans will
be continued for any period of time or cannot be amended or terminated at any
time or for any reason, (iv) any plans or arrangements provided by Parent will

mechanisms will be required to be funded.

            (f) Neither the Company, nor its Subsidiaries, nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity has any liability for life, health, medical or other welfare
benefits for former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof with
coverage or benefits under Benefit Plans other than Pension Plans, other than as
required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or any other

administrative costs attributable to Benefit Plans have been paid when due.

            (h) To the Company's Knowledge, no Pension Plan or Welfare Plan or
any "fiduciary" or "party-in-interest" (as such terms are respectively defined
by Sections 3(21) and 3(14) of ERISA) thereto has engaged in a transaction
prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code for which a valid

thereof in connection with the existence, operation or administration of a
Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits.

            (j) Nothing in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by

            (a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, any other party, is in violation or breach of or in
default (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, does there exist any condition

the Company or its Subsidiaries or which names the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as an insured (or loss payee), including those which pertain to the

Subsidiaries have received notice of cancellation of any such insurance

            Section 4.14      Compliance with Applicable Law.

            (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all material permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, Orders and approvals of all Governmental
Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the
"Company Permits"). The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Company Permits, except for such failures to comply which are, in
the aggregate, immaterial. The businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any Law other than
violations that are, in the aggregate, immaterial. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to
conduct any such investigation or review.

            (b) The Company is not an "investment company" under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC thereunder.

            (c) The Company and each of its officers and directors are in
compliance with, and have complied, in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated under such Act (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") or the
Exchange Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s National Market. There are no
outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
executive officer (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of the Company. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any loans to any executive
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within
those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Company's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for the Company's
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal controls. For purposes of this
paragraph, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall
have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

expected (i) to have access to the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
proprietary information is party to a written agreement of confidentiality
customary in the biopharmaceuticals industry, or (ii) to be involved in the
creation or development of Intellectual Property on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is party to a written agreement with an assignment of
inventions provision. No officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement with any other Person which requires
such officer or employee to assign any interest in any (i) Company Intellectual
Property or (ii) Intellectual Property conceived and/or reduced to practice by
such officer or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by such employee in the course
of such officer's or employee's employment at the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, to any Persons other than the Company or its Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company Intellectual Property includes all the
Intellectual Property that is necessary for the conduct of the business of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

            (c) The Company or its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed or
otherwise possesses sufficient legal enforceable rights to use, the Company
Intellectual Property. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no facts,
proceedings, claims or challenges that cause or would cause any Owned
Intellectual Property to be invalid or unenforceable, or challenging the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' rights in any Company Intellectual Property, and
the Company has not received any notice from any Person bringing or threatening
to bring such proceedings, claims or challenges. To the Company's Knowledge,
there are no facts, proceedings, claims or challenges that cause or would cause
any Non-Owned Intellectual Property to be invalid or unenforceable. To the
Company's Knowledge, no act has been done or omitted to be done by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries thereof, which has, had or could have the effect of
impairing or dedicating to the public, or entitling any Person to cancel,
forfeit, modify or consider abandoned, any (i) Owned Intellectual Property or
(ii) Non-Owned Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or give any Person any rights with respect thereto. To the
extent required in the Company's reasonable judgment and consistent with prudent
practices in the biopharmaceuticals industry, all necessary registration,
maintenance and renewal fees in respect of the (i) Owned Intellectual Property
and (ii) Non-Owned Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, have been paid and all necessary documents and
certificates have been filed with the relevant Governmental Entities for the
purpose of maintaining such Owned Intellectual Property and such Non-Owned
Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the Company's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has divulged, furnished to or made accessible any of their Trade
Secrets to any Person who is not subject to a written agreement to maintain the
confidentiality of such Trade Secrets. The Company and its Subsidiaries take and
have taken reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of their Trade
Secrets.

            (d) To the Company's Knowledge, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective current activities, products or services
infringes,

                                       34
<PAGE>
misappropriates, violates or otherwise conflicts with, or has infringed,
misappropriated, violated or otherwise conflicted with, any valid Intellectual
Property of any Person, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
received any notice or are subject to any actual or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened proceedings claiming or alleging such. No proceedings or
claims in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleges that any Person
is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any (i) Owned
Intellectual Property or (ii) Non-Owned Intellectual Property exclusively
licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, are pending, and none have
been served by, instituted or asserted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, are any proceedings
threatened alleging any such infringement, misappropriation or violation, nor is
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries aware of any such infringement,
misappropriation or violation. To the Company's Knowledge, there are no breaches
or defaults of, or any disputes or threatened disputes concerning, any of the IP
Contracts. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any right
or license under the Company Intellectual Property to any other Person other
than those rights or licenses granted pursuant to IP Contracts listed in Section
4.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

            (e) To the Knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) result in the loss of,
or otherwise adversely affect, any rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in any Company Intellectual Property, (ii) grant or require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant to any Person any rights with
respect to any Company Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property of Parent,
(iii) subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any increase in
royalties or other payments in respect of any Company Intellectual Property,
(iv) diminish any royalties or other payments the Company or its Subsidiaries
would otherwise be entitled to in respect of any Company Intellectual Property,
or (v) result in the breach or, by the terms of such contract, termination of
any IP Contract.

            (f) The Company has delivered to Parent a true, complete and
accurate copy of the Novasite Restated License Agreement, as in effect on the
date hereof. The Novasite Restated License Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of the parties, enforceable among the parties thereto in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and all requisite
consents in connection with the Novasite Restated License Agreement have been
obtained by the Company or Novasite, as the case may be. Under the terms of the
Novasite Restated License Agreement, the license granted by the Company to
Novasite thereunder is limited to the identification and development of "small
molecules," which term, for purposes of such license, shall mean an organic
molecule having a molecular weight of less than 1,200 (other than a
polynucleotide or polynucleoside comprising two or more bases, or a polypeptide
or protein comprising two or more amino acids). Novasite has not granted any
right or license under the Company Intellectual Property to any other Person for
any purpose other than the identification and development of "small molecules"
as that term is defined in the immediately preceding sentence.

Subsidiaries (each such product, a "Biologic"), each such Biologic is being
developed, manufactured, or tested in compliance with all applicable
requirements under the FDCA and similar Laws, including those relating to
investigational use, and good manufacturing practices, record keeping, filing of
reports and security. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

Governmental Entity alleging any violation of any Law by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries applicable to any Biologic.

Service Act or 21 C.F.R. Parts 312 et seq., respectively, and similar Laws and
all terms and conditions of such licenses or applications. As to each such
Biologic, the Company and any relevant Subsidiary of the Company, and the
officers, employees or agents of the Company or such Subsidiary, have included
in the application for such Biologic, where required, the certification
described in 21 U.S.C. Section 335a(k)(1) or any similar Law and the list
described in 21 U.S.C. Section 335a(k)(2) or any similar Law, and each such
certification and list was true, complete and correct in all material respects
when made.

            (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee or agent of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, has made an untrue statement of a material fact or
fraudulent statement to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, failed to
disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other
Governmental Entity, or committed an act, made a statement, or failed to make a
statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, would reasonably be
expected to provide a basis for the FDA or any other Governmental Entity to
invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts,
Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities", set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10,
1991) or any similar policy. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any officer, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any crime or engaged
in any conduct for which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. Section 335a(a) or

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each representation and warranty
made by the Company in this Section 4.20 with respect to the Biologics licensed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to third parties (for which the
Company or such Subsidiary has assumed or retained no responsibility for
regulatory compliance) set forth on Section 4.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be limited to the Knowledge of the Company.

            Section 4.21 Absence of Indemnifiable Claims, etc. There are no
pending claims and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no facts that would
reasonably entitle any director, officer or employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to indemnification by the Company or its Subsidiaries under
applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, any insurance policy maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Company Indemnity Agreements or similar agreements to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its
properties or assets may be bound.

            Section 4.22 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received
the opinion of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (the "Company Financial Advisor"), dated

Agreement, the Merger Consideration to be received in the Merger is fair to the
Company's stockholders from a financial point of view, and a complete and

stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated hereby.

<PAGE>
            (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and
their officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, "Representatives")
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated immediately any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not,
nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Representatives, to (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage, or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any
Takeover Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) initiate or participate in any
way in any negotiations or discussions regarding, or furnish or disclose to any
Person (other than a party to this Agreement) any information with respect to,
or take any other action to knowingly facilitate or in furtherance of any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (iv) grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or any similar agreement with respect to any class of the
Company's equity securities; provided, however, at any time prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date
hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 6.2, the Company may, if its Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consulting with outside counsel) that it is
required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and subject to compliance with
Section 6.2(c), (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and the standstill
provisions of the Standstill Agreement, provided that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

            (b) The Company shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior written
notice (or such other prior notice as is reasonably practicable in light of
notice of less than 48 hours provided to members of the Board of Directors) of
any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is
reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal.

            (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated

                                       46
<PAGE>
by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a)) (an
"Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable law; provided, however, that (i) no Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall be made until after the third Business Day following Parent's
receipt of written notice (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by
the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new three Business Day
period); (ii) during such three Business Day period the Company shall negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation
of this Agreement and not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (iii)
the Company shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, prior to
the expiration of such three Business Day period, Parent makes a proposal to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors) to be at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal.

            (d) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the
Company set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.2, promptly
on the date of receipt thereof, the Company shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of any request for information that could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Takeover Proposal, or any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry, discussions or
negotiations with respect to any Takeover Proposal and the terms and conditions
of such request, Takeover Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations and the
Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials
received by the Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person or group making any such request, Takeover Proposal or
inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The
Company agrees that it shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent fully informed as to the details of
any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the details of
all discussions or negotiations with respect to any such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry.

            (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors (after consultation with outside counsel), such disclosure would be
required under applicable law; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by 6.2(c).

            (f) The Company agrees that immediately following the execution of
this Agreement it shall request each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement since July 24, 2000 in connection with such Person's
consideration of acquiring the Company to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf.

            Section 6.3 Company Stockholder Meeting; Preparation of Form S-4
Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

            (a) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Sections 6.2(c)
and 6.2(e), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders adoption of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company's obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.3(a) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal or
(ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof of such Board of Directors' or such committee's approval
or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no breach of this
Section 6.3(a) shall be deemed to have occurred if the Company adjourns or
postpones the Company Stockholders Meeting for a reasonable period of time, each
such period of time not to exceed ten Business Days, provided that (x) at the
time of such adjournment or postponement the Board of Directors shall be
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement from making a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, and the Company Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to
occur within three Business Days of the time of such adjournment or postponement
or (y) at the time the Board of Directors announces a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to
occur no later than ten Business Days from the date of such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided that the Company may not adjourn or postpone the
Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this clause (y) more than two times or
for more than fifteen Business Days in the aggregate.

            (b) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with
the SEC (i) a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") relating to the Company

all amendments thereto, the "Form S-

                                       48
<PAGE>
4") in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be included as a prospectus,
in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent
Shares to be issued to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger.
Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Form
S-4 to become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
filing and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to take all or any action required under any applicable
federal or state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Shares pursuant to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other party in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4. As promptly as practicable after the Form
S-4 shall have become effective, the Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders. Each of Parent and the Company shall
also promptly file, use all of their respective reasonable efforts to cause to
become effective as promptly as practicable and, if required, mail to the
Company's stockholders, any amendment to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus which may become necessary after the date the Form S-4 is
declared effective.

            (c) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 will be made by Parent or the Company without the approval of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of Parent
and the Company will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior
to the Effective Time any information relating to either party, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company
or Parent, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form
S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that either of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with
the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Company's
stockholders.

            (d) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Parent two letters from the Company's independent public
accountants, one dated the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective and
one dated the date of the Effective Time, each addressed to the Company and
Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in
scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company
two letters from Parent's independent public accountants, one dated the date on
which the Form S-4 shall become effective and one dated the date of

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.

            Section 6.4 Access to Information. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, agents and other Representatives reasonable access to all
of the properties, personnel, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation, workpapers
and other items relating to Taxes), and shall furnish promptly all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request. All such information shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the parties (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that
may be relevant to the tax structure of the Merger beginning on the date of this
Agreement, provided, however, that no party (nor any employee, representative or
other agent thereof) may disclose any other information that is not relevant to
understanding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction (including
the identity of any party and any information that could lead another to
determine the identity of any party), or any other information to the extent
that such disclosure could result in a violation of any federal or state
securities law.

            Section 6.5 Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of any claim by a third
party that a material contract has been breached, is in default, may not be
renewed or that a consent would be required as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of determining the satisfaction of
the conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, no
such supplement, amendment or information shall be considered.

            Section 6.6 Reasonable Efforts.

            (a) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
taking of such reasonable actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite
approvals, consents, Orders, exemptions or waivers by any third party or
Governmental Entity, including filings pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) using
reasonable efforts to cause the satisfaction of all conditions to Closing. Each
party shall promptly consult with the other with respect to, provide any
necessary information with respect to and provide the other (or its counsel)
copies of, all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any


                                       50
<PAGE>
other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.6 shall require or be
construed to require Parent to (x) offer or agree to enter into any agreements,
including agreements to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate
or otherwise divest itself of, all or any portion of Parent's businesses or
assets or any portion of the businesses or assets of any of its Subsidiaries or
any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (y) provide any compensation, benefits or other consideration to
Company Employees except as set forth in Section 3.4 and Section 6.15.

            (b) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the others of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any party or affiliate thereof receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any such
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Nothing herein
shall require any party to waive any substantial rights or agree to any
substantial limitation on its (or the Surviving Corporation's) operations or to
divest itself of any assets.

            Section 6.7 State Takeover Statutes. Parent, the Company and their
respective Board of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement or the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

            Section 6.8 Indemnification.

            (a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, (i) to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) without limiting the obligations
under clause (i) but only to the extent permitted under applicable Law, as
required pursuant to any indemnity agreements of the Company (the "Company
Indemnity Agreements") (and Parent also shall advance attorneys' fees and
expenses as incurred; provided, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated

                                       51
<PAGE>
hereby) and such obligation shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time; provided that in
the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims shall continue
until final disposition of any and all such claims.

            (b) Subject to the satisfaction by the Company and its directors and
officers of customary eligibility conditions, Parent shall purchase a single
payment, run-off policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance covering
each person currently covered by the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance on terms with respect to coverage and amounts as favorable
as may be available (but no more favorable than the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof), such policy to
be effective for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be obligated to pay a premium for such policy in
excess of 300% of the last annual aggregate premium paid prior to the date of
this Agreement by the Company for the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof.

            (c) Until six (6) years from the Effective Time, unless otherwise
required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the
elimination of liability of directors and the indemnification of directors and
officers than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Company, as in effect on the date hereof.

            (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.

            (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.8
shall be in addition to any right such Person might have under the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their
respective heirs and representatives.

            Section 6.9 Certain Litigation. The Company agrees that it shall not
settle any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any
of its directors by any stockholder of the Company relating to the Merger or
this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent. In addition, the
Company shall not cooperate with any third party that may hereafter seek to
restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger and shall cooperate with
Parent and Merger Sub to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or
otherwise oppose the Merger.

            Section 6.10 Listing of Parent Shares. Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Closing Date. Any fees in connection with such listing shall be paid by
Parent.

            Section 6.11 Affiliates. Not less than ten Business Days prior to
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent
a letter identifying all Persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may be
deemed, at the time this Agreement is submitted for adoption by the stockholders
of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such list shall be
updated as necessary to reflect changes after the date thereof. The Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to
deliver to Parent not later than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
a written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.

            Section 6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of (a) any notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become
a default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract material to
the condition (financial or otherwise), business, properties, assets or results
of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, (b) any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) any Company Material Adverse Effect or the occurrence of any
event or events which could be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (d) the occurrence or existence
of any event which makes or, with the passage of time or otherwise, is
reasonably likely to make any representation or warranty contained herein
(without giving effect to any exception or qualification contained therein
relating to materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect) untrue in any
material respect; provided, however, that the delivery of notice pursuant to
this Section 6.12 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent.

            Section 6.13 Tax Covenants.

            (a) The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent with past practice all Tax Returns (whether
separate or consolidated, combined, group or unitary Tax Returns that include
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) that are required to be filed (with
extensions) on or before the Closing Date; provided, however, that Parent shall
have a reasonable opportunity, beginning at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date thereof, to review and comment on the form and substance of such Tax
Return.

            (b) All contracts, agreements, arrangements, or intercompany account
systems under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may at any time have
an

                                       53
<PAGE>
obligation to indemnify for or share the payment of or liability for any portion
of a Tax (or any amount calculated with reference to any portion of a Tax) shall
be terminated with respect to the Company and each such Subsidiary on or prior
to the Closing Date, and the Company and each such Subsidiary shall thereafter
be released from any liability thereunder.

            (c) Except as required by applicable law, without obtaining Parent's
prior written consent, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, make, change or revoke any election in respect of Taxes, file
any amended Tax Return, adopt or change any material accounting method or period
in respect of Taxes, enter into any material closing agreement, settle any
material claim or assessment in respect of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of any statute of limitation applicable to any material claim or
assessment in respect of Taxes or offer or agree to do any of the foregoing or
surrender its rights to do any of the foregoing or to claim any refund in
respect of Taxes.

            (d) Parent and Company intend that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that it will not take, and will
cause its Subsidiaries not to take any action, or fail to take any action, which
action or failure would be reasonably likely to cause the Merger not to so
qualify.

            Section 6.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Company Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Company
Shares) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            Section 6.15 Benefits and Other Employee Matters.

            (a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees") will continue to be provided
with benefits under employee benefit plans (other than equity incentive plans)
that are comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that with respect
to any Company Employees whose primary location of employment is also the
primary location of employment of employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, in
satisfaction of its obligations under this sentence, Parent may provide such
Company Employees with benefits under employee benefit plans (other than equity
incentive plans) that are comparable in the aggregate to those provided by
Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.


                                       54
<PAGE>
            (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause service
performed by Company Employees for the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) to be taken into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting, and for purposes of determining severance, vacation and other paid time
off entitlements, under the benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees participate to the extent such service was credited by
the Company and its Subsidiaries under similar Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.15(b) shall be construed to require
crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii)
service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, (iii)
service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not
taken into account or (iv) employer contribution for any 401(k) plan.

            (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) cause to be
waived any pre-existing condition limitations under welfare benefit plans,
policies or practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees
participate and (ii) cause to be credited any deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries and dependents
during the portion of the calendar year prior to participation in the benefit
plans provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries.

            (d) It is the present intention of Parent and the Company that
following the Effective Time, there will be no major reductions in work force at
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to encourage Company Employees to remain
employed with the Company following the Effective Time; provided that nothing in
this Section 6.15(d) shall (i) require or be construed to require Parent to
provide any compensation or benefits other than as set forth above in Sections
6.15(a) through (c) or (ii) permit or be construed to permit the Company to take
any actions except as expressly permitted by Section 6.1(b) and Section 6.1(n).

            Section 6.16 Subsidiary Matters. To the extent that Novasite would
not be deemed a "Subsidiary" of the Company after the date of this Agreement
based on the definition of "Subsidiary" in Article I, the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause Novasite to comply with all of the obligations under
this Article VI applicable to (or with respect to) a Subsidiary of the Company.

                                  ARTICLE VII

court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity or other legal
restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in
effect; provided, however, that each of the parties shall have used reasonable
efforts to prevent the entry of any such Order and to appeal as promptly as
possible any Order that may be entered.

            (c) Governmental Consents and Approvals. All necessary consents and
approvals of any Governmental Entity required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been obtained, and any
waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act
shall have expired or been terminated.

            (d) NYSE Listing. Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger and such
other shares to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger shall

Effect the Merger. The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger
shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions, any one or
more of which may be waived, in writing, by Parent:

            (a) Representations Accurate. Each of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct
(without giving effect to any exception or qualification contained therein
relating to materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect) as of the date of
this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made as of such time
(except for those representations and warranties which address matters only as
of a particular date which shall have been true and correct as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, or would not reasonably
be likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) Performance. The Company shall have complied, in all material
respects, with all agreements, obligations, covenants and conditions required by
this Agreement to be complied with by it on or prior to the Closing Date.

            (c) Officer's Certificate. Parent shall have received a certificate
of an executive officer of the Company to the effect set forth in Sections
7.2(a) and 7.2(b).

            (d) Consents. Parent shall have received evidence, in form and
substance satisfactory to it, that the Company shall have obtained all consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders of third parties required
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.


                                       56
<PAGE>
            (e) Certain Employees. No fewer that 70% of the scientific and/or
technical employees of the Company listed in Section 7.2(e)(1) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be actively employed by the Company as of the Closing.
In addition, each of the individual(s) named in Section 7.2(e)(2) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be actively employed by the Company as of the Closing,
except to the extent where the failure of such named individual to be so
actively employed as of the Closing results solely from the death or permanent
and total disability of such named individual.

            (f) FIRPTA Certificate. The Company shall have furnished to Parent a
certification in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.1445-2(c), and otherwise
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, certifying that an
interest in the Company is not a real property interest because the Company is
not and has not been a United States real property holding corporation (as
defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the applicable period specified
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code (a "FIRPTA Certificate").
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent does
not receive a FIRPTA Certificate prior to the Closing despite the Company's
reasonable efforts to provide such FIRPTA Certificate, Parent shall waive this
condition and withhold from the consideration payable hereunder in accordance
with the requirements of section 1445 of the Code.

            (g) License. The Novasite Restated License Agreement shall be in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.

            (h) Tax Opinion. Parent shall have received an opinion of its
special tax counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom (Illinois), in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, based on facts, representations
and assumptions set forth in such opinion that are consistent with the state of
facts existing at the Effective Time, to the effect that the Merger will qualify
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and
rely upon representations contained in certificates of executive officers of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and others.

            Section 7.3 Conditions to the Company's Obligation to Effect the
Merger. The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction of the following conditions, any one or more of which may be
waived, in writing, by the Company:

            (a) Representations Accurate. Each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true
and correct (without giving effect to any exception or qualification contained
therein relating to materiality or a Parent Material Adverse Effect) as of the
date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made as of such
time (except for those representations and warranties which address matters only
as of a particular date which shall have been true and correct as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, or would not reasonably
be likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.


                                       57
<PAGE>
            (b) Performance. Parent and Merger Sub shall have complied, in all
material respects, with all agreements, obligations, covenants and conditions
required by this Agreement to be complied with by it on or prior to the Closing

certificate of an executive officer of the Parent and Merger Sub to the effect
set forth in Sections 7.3(a) and 7.3(b).

            (d) Tax Opinion. The Company will have received an opinion of its
special tax counsel, Pillsbury Winthrop LLP, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, based on facts, representations and assumptions set
forth in such opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing at
the Effective Time, to the effect that the Merger will qualify for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(a)
of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely upon
representations contained in certificates of officers of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and others.

            Section 7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was caused by such party's failure to act in good faith or to use its reasonable
efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                            TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

            Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any

      terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be
      available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
      been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on
      or before the Termination Date; or

                  (iii) there shall be any Law or Order that has the effects set
      forth in Section 7.1(b).


                                       58
<PAGE>
            (c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub (A) shall have breached
any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied

representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement
such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) would not be

being cured by the Termination Date or is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub

      would not be satisfied or (B) there exists a breach of any representation
      or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement such that the
      closing condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied, and,

      or Merger Sub;

                  (ii) in the event that prior to the obtaining of the Company
      Stockholder Approval (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
      have occurred, (B) the Company will have failed to include in the Proxy
      Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that
      its stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the transactions
      contemplated hereby, (C) the Board of Directors of the Company fails

      the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer or (E) a
      Takeover Proposal is publicly announced, and the Company fails to issue,
      within ten Business Days after such Takeover Proposal is announced, a

      of the Company that its stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and the
      transactions contemplated hereby; or

                  (iii) if the Company breaches any of its obligations under
      Section 6.2.

            Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there

                                       59
<PAGE>
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective officers or directors; provided, however, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any willful breach of any of its representations and warranties
or the breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement
or from any rights, claims, causes of action or remedies arising from fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or concealment; provided further, that the
provisions of this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses), Section 8.4
(Termination Fee), Section 9.7 (Publicity) and Article IX of this Agreement, the

and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of

incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including any SEC filing fees).

            Section 8.4 Termination Fee.

            (a) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to (i) Section
8.1(b)(i), 8.1(b)(ii) or 8.1(d)(i) and (A) at any time after the date hereof a
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated
to the Company's Board of Directors and (B) within 12 months of the termination
of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with any third
party with respect to a transaction similar to a Takeover Proposal (solely for
purposes of this Section 8.4(a)(i)(B), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have
the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in
Article I except that all references to "15%" shall be deemed to be references
to "30%") or any such transaction is consummated or (ii) Section 8.1(d)(ii) or
8.1(d)(iii) hereof, then the Company shall (1) in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 8.4(a), upon the earlier to occur of the
execution of such definitive agreement and such consummation or (2) in the case
of termination pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.4(a), within one
Business Day of such termination, pay Parent a non-refundable fee in an amount
equal to $20,250,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to the Company
by Parent.

            (b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination
Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment Parent commences a suit which results
in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay
to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorney's fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate in
effect from time to time and quoted in The Wall Street Journal

                                       60
<PAGE>
during such period. Parent agrees that the payment of the Termination Fee, if
such payment is payable and is actually paid in accordance with Section 8.4(a),
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent upon a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to and in the manner described in Section 8.4(a).

            Section 8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, subject
to Section 9.11, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 9.1 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. All
covenants shall survive in accordance with their terms. This Article IX, the
agreements of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in Section 6.8
(Indemnification), Section 6.15 (Benefits and Other Employee Matters) and
Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses) and those other covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms apply, or that are to be performed in whole
or in part, after the Effective Time shall survive the consummation of the
Merger.

            Section 9.2 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given upon receipt by the parties at the
following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified
by like notice) and shall be deemed to have been duly received if so given (i)
if sent by telecopy or facsimile transmission, when the electronic confirmation
of successful transmission is received or (ii) if delivered in person, any

                                     [DATE]

ELI LILLY AND COMPANY
Lilly Corporate Center
Indianapolis, Indiana 46285


Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
dated as of November 21, 2003 by and among Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana
corporation ("Parent"), Genesis Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") and Applied Molecular
Evolution, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to which
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger").

The undersigned has been advised that as of the date of this letter the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of
Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
The undersigned is delivering this letter of undertaking and commitment pursuant
to Section 6.11 of the Merger Agreement.

With respect to the shares of common stock, no par value, of Parent as may be
received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Agreement ("Parent Shares"),
the undersigned represents to and agrees with Parent that:

            A. The undersigned will not make any offer to sell or any sale or
      other disposition of all or any part of Parent Shares in violation of the
      Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 145, and will
      hold all Parent Shares subject to all applicable provisions of the Act and
      the rules and regulations thereunder.

            B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger
      Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents and other
      applicable limitations upon the undersigned's ability to sell, transfer or
      otherwise dispose of Parent Shares to the extent the undersigned felt
      necessary with the undersigned's counsel or counsel for the Company.

            C. The undersigned has been advised that the offering, sale and
      delivery of Parent Shares to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger
      Agreement will be registered under the Act on a Registration Statement on
      Form S-4. The undersigned has also been advised, however, that, since the
      undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company at the time the
      Merger is submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, any
      public reoffering or resale by the undersigned of any of Parent Shares
      will, under current law, require either (i) the further registration under
      the Act of Parent Shares to be sold, (ii) compliance with
<PAGE>
      Rule 145 promulgated under the Act (permitting limited sales under certain
      circumstances) or (iii) the availability of another exemption from
      registration under the Act.

            D. The undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to
      register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Shares by the
      undersigned or on the undersigned's behalf under the Act or to take any
      other action necessary in order to enable such sale, transfer or other
      disposition by the undersigned to be made in compliance with an exemption
      from such registration.

            E. The undersigned also understands that, if Parent should deem it
      necessary to comply with the requirements of the Act, stop transfer
      instructions will be given to Parent's transfer agents with respect to
      Parent Shares and that there will be placed on the certificates for Parent
      Shares, or any substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance:

                  "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN
                  A TRANSACTION UNDER RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES
                  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND MAY BE SOLD,
                  TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
                  TERMS OF THE LETTER AGREEMENT, DATED [-], BETWEEN THE HOLDER
                  HEREOF AND ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE
                  AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF ELI LILLY AND COMPANY.

            F. It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in
      paragraph E above will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
      without such legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been
      registered for sale by the undersigned under the Act, (ii) Parent has
      received satisfactory written evidence that the securities represented
      thereby have been sold in compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the
      substitute certificates shall be issued in the name of the transferee) or
      (iii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, in form and
      substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter
      obtained by undersigned from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission (the "Commission"), to the effect that the restrictions imposed
      by Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

            G. The undersigned understands and agrees that the representations,
      warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set forth herein
      are for the benefit of Parent and the Company and will be relied upon by
      such entities and their respective counsel and accountants.

            H. The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter will
      apply to all shares of the capital stock of Parent and the Company that
      are deemed to be


                                       A-2
<PAGE>
      beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal
      securities laws.

For so long as and to the extent necessary to permit the undersigned to sell
Parent Shares pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under
the Act, Parent will take all reasonable actions to file, on a timely basis, all
reports and other information required to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.

Any notices or any other communications in connection herewith will be in
writing and will be given to Parent at Parent's address on the first page of
this letter and to the undersigned at the address set forth below the
undersigned's name; or to such other address or person as Parent will furnish to
the undersigned in writing or that the undersigned will furnish to Parent in
writing in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph; and will be deemed
to have been duly received if so given (i) if delivered in person or by courier,
upon actual receipt by the intended party, (ii) if sent by telecopy or facsimile
transmission, when the electronic confirmation of successful transmission is
received or (iii) if sent by mail, upon five days after such notice or other
communication is deposited in the mail.

This letter will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of
applicable principles of conflicts of laws. This letter will be binding upon the
undersigned and Parent and their respective successors and assigns. This letter
is the complete agreement between the undersigned and Parent concerning the
subject matter hereof. In the event that any signature hereto is delivered by
facsimile transmission, such signature will create a valid and binding
obligation of the executing party with the same force and effect as if such
facsimile signature page were an original thereof. If the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective Time (as defined
in the Merger Agreement), then the legal effect of this letter will thereupon
automatically terminate.


                                      A-3
<PAGE>
Execution of this letter will not be considered an admission on the part of the
undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Act or as a waiver of any rights the undersigned may have
to any claim that the undersigned is not such an affiliate on or after the date
of this letter.

                                               Very truly yours,


                                               _________________________________
