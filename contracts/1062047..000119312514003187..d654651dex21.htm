of filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State in accordance
with the DGCL or at such later time as the parties may agree in writing and
as is provided in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "

Section 2.07 _Conversion of Common Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock (other than (i) the
shares of Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to  _Section 2.07(d)_ and
(ii) the Appraisal Shares, which shall only have those rights set forth in
_Section 2.07(b)_) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub or the holders of any Capital
Stock of the Company or Merger Sub, be converted into and thereafter only
evidence the right to receive, without interest, an amount in cash equal to

Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such share of Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided herein.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that have not
been voted in favor of the Merger and are held by any holder that (i) is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and (ii) complies in all respects with,
Section 262, shall at the Effective Time (A) not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section
2.07(a)_ and (B) no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and at the Effective Time each holder of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to only such rights granted to such holder under
Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder fails to

rights under Section 262, such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have
become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.07(a)_, without interest.

 

(c) The Company shall provide notice to Parent as soon as practicable of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Common Stock and of withdrawals of
such demands and any other written instruments provided to the Company

shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment to
any holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or enter into any Contract to do any of the
foregoing. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend or waive any
obligation of any holder of Common Stock who has waived or limited the right
to assert dissentersÂ’ rights in a separate agreement.

Parent, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub or

Section 2.08 _Company Stock Options_. As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or any committee thereof
administering the Stock Option Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time,
and without any action on the part of any holder of any Option, each Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per share that is less
than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall terminate, be cancelled and
cease to exist at the Effective Time, and each holder of such Option will only
be entitled to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation in settlement
of such Option the Option Cash Amount as provided herein.

Section 2.09 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
each share of Merger Sub Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and thereafter
evidence in the aggregate one fully paid and nonassessable Surviving
Corporation Common Share with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective
Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Capital Stock shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

Section 2.10 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or
their respective agents), as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Common Stock or Options such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld and paid to the applicable Governmental Authority
under the Code or any Tax Law. Any such withheld amounts shall be timely paid
to the applicable Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 Section 2.11 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding
shares of Capital Stock of the Company shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
amounts payable under this Agreement in respect of the shares of Common Stock
and the Options shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holder of Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated under this Agreement prior to
such action, _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.11_ shall be deemed
to permit or authorize any party to effect any such change that is not
otherwise authorized or permitted under this Agreement.

 

Section 2.12 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Letter of Transmittal_. Not less than ten Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide a Letter of Transmittal to each

21 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) _Payment for Shares of Common Stock_. Parent shall pay the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.14_. After the
Effective Time, upon surrender of any Certificates to the Surviving
Corporation, together with the properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a
holder of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, in exchange therefor, the Per Share Merger
Consideration for such shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificates
as contemplated hereby. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article II_. If a transfer of ownership of any shares of Common Stock
occurs that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Common Stock to the
transferee if such transferee presents to the Surviving Corporation the
applicable Certificate properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and such other documents reasonably required to evidence and effect
such transfer and reasonable evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid.

(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, and the holder of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby
(i) makes an affidavit of that fact and (ii) if required by the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, executes an indemnification agreement
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the former holders of Common
Stock for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any
former holder of Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Section 2.12_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any Per
Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any portion of the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, any Affiliate of the foregoing or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 

(e) _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, but in any event with 20 Business Days after the date hereof, the
Company, Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Escrow Agent to, enter into an escrow agreement, which
escrow agreement shall not contain any provisions relating to the payments to
the Sellers, the Option Holders or Parent that are not contemplated by this
Agreement, other than customary mechanical provisions (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ ").

Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer

the Company shall provide to Parent a written statement setting forth the
CompanyÂ’s good faith estimate of (i) Estimated Closing Working Capital, (ii)
the Aggregate Option Exercise Price, (iii) Estimated Closing Cash, (iv) the
Closing Debt, including the ABL Amount, the Debenture Amount and the Holdco

seven Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, and (D) a notice

Aggregate Purchase Price and the Per Share Merger Consideration as of such
date, and the accounts to which Parent shall transfer funds pursuant to
_Sections 2.14(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_. During such five Business Day period,
the Company shall provide to Parent, on reasonable advance notice and during
regular business hours, reasonable access to accounting representatives of the
Company. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the principles set forth on _Schedule II_ to this Agreement, and to the extent
not set forth on _Schedule II_ , in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner
consistent with the principles, policies and methodologies used by the
Company in the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2012 (collectively, the " _Balance Sheet Principles_
"). Following delivery to Parent of the Estimated Closing Statement and prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall consider in good faith any significant
errors asserted by Parent prior to the Closing Date in the calculation of the
amounts contained in the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Notice
and, if it is in agreement with any such asserted errors, the Company shall
appropriately adjust the amounts in the Estimated Closing Statement and the
Closing Notice to correct such errors.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any case no later than 60 days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Principles and delivered to the Sellers a closing statement
setting forth ParentÂ’s calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Cash, and containing an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements) (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

 

(c) If the Sellers disagree with the Closing Statement or ParentÂ’s calculation
of Closing Working Capital or Closing Cash delivered pursuant to _Section
2.15(b)_, the Sellers may, within 45 days after receipt of the Closing Notice,
deliver a notice to Parent providing

 



24 ##### Table of Contents

  

 reasonable detail of the reason for any disagreement and setting forth the
SellersÂ’ calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall
specify all items or amounts with which the Sellers disagree, and the parties
shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in
the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Working Capital and
Closing Cash delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.15(b)_. If the Sellers do not
deliver any such notice by such date, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement and the calculations contained therein shall be
final and binding on the Sellers and Parent. The Sellers and Parent shall
cause their respective representatives to cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital and Closing Cash, and in the conduct of the review referred
to in this _Section 2.15_, including making available, to the extent
necessary, books, records, work papers and appropriate personnel. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Sellers and their representatives (including
accountants) shall have reasonable access to the books and records of the
Company, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Parent or ParentÂ’s
accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Statement and to
such historical financial information (to the extent in ParentÂ’s possession)
relating to the Closing Statement as the Sellers may reasonably request for
the purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement and to prepare a notice of
disagreement.

 

(d) If a notice of disagreement is delivered in accordance with _Section
2.15(c)_, the Sellers and Parent shall, during the 30 days following such
delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of the
Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash. If, during such period, the
Sellers and Parent are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause the Referee to review the relevant portions of this
Agreement, the Closing Statement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash. In making
such calculation, the Referee shall consider only those remaining items or
amounts in the Closing Statement and ParentÂ’s calculation of Closing Working
Capital and Closing Cash as to which the Sellers still dispute at the time of
such review and shall use the Balance Sheet Principles. Parent and the Sellers
shall have the opportunity to provide written submissions regarding their
positions on the disputed matters, which written submissions shall
be provided to the Referee, if at all, no later than 15 Business Days after
the date of referral of the disputed matters to the Referee. The determination
of the Referee shall be based solely on the written submissions by Parent and
the Sellers and their respective representatives. The Referee shall deliver
to Parent and the Sellers, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later
than 30 Business Days from the date of engagement of the Referee), a report
setting forth its calculation of the Closing Working Capital and Closing
Cash, as applicable; _provided_ , that the Referee may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either
Parent or the Sellers or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Parent or the Sellers. Such report shall be final and binding on,
and non-appealable by, Parent and the Sellers. The costs and expenses of the
Referee shall be borne in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the Referee that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Parent, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, as finally determined by the Referee, bears to the total dollar
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted.

 



25 ##### Table of Contents

  

(e) Following a final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount,
Parent and the Sellers shall deliver a Joint Direction instructing the Escrow
Agent to make the following payments out of the Escrow Account:

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) to the Sellers and
the Option Holders, an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (x) the lesser of
(1) the Holdback Amount and (2) the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, _plus_
 (y) the Holdback Amount, and (B) to Parent, any amount remaining in the
Escrow Account;

(ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, (A) to Parent, an
amount equal to the sum of (x) the lesser of (1) the Holdback Amount and (2)
the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (y) the
Holdback Amount, and (B) to the Sellers and the Option Holders, any amount
remaining in the Escrow Account; and

(iii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is zero, (A) to Parent, an amount
equal to the Holdback Amount, and (B) to the Sellers and the Option Holders,
an aggregate amount equal to the Holdback Amount.

 

(f) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.15_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price by the parties for all purposes
under this Agreement and for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

(g) All joint actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers under this
_Section 2.15_ shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Sellers and
Option Holders. No Seller or Option Holder shall have any cause of action
against any other Seller, and no Seller shall have any liability whatsoever
to any other Seller or Option Holder, for any action taken or not taken,
decision made or instruction given jointly by the Sellers under this _Section
2.15_. The Sellers may jointly incur Dispute Expenses on behalf of the
Sellers and Option Holders in connection with any dispute arising under this
_Section 2.15_. Such Dispute Expenses shall be paid from (and reduce) any
amount otherwise payable to the Sellers and Option Holders under this
_Section 2.15_, and to the extent such amount is insufficient to fully pay
such Dispute Expenses, each Seller and Option Holder shall be responsible for
its Fully Diluted Pro Rata Share thereof. Parent and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) may rely
exclusively, without independent verification or investigation, upon all joint
actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers under this Section 2.15
(including a Joint Direction).

Adverse Effect.

Material Contract is a valid and binding agreement of the Company or
Subsidiary of the Company party thereto, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect as against
the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in accordance with its terms,
except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights or by principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity) and (ii) where the failure of such validity, binding nature or
enforceability would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

sensitive materials provided to the other party under this _Section 5.05_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
stockholders, employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its
legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.05_, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company. No
party shall agree to, or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
respective representatives to, participate in any meeting or substantive

terminated in accordance with Article VII. Notwithstanding anything to the

decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license

businesses of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries, and any other prohibitions against or limitations, conditions or
restrictions on, the activities of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in an Adverse Regulatory Condition. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall not,
without the prior consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, publicly, or before any Governmental Authority, offer, suggest,
propose,

Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be obligated to commit to take
any action pursuant to _Section 5.03_,  _Section 5.04_ or this _Section
5.05_, the consummation of which or effectiveness thereof is not conditioned
on the consummation of the Closing. If reasonably requested by Parent, the
Company shall take any action with respect to the business of the Company
required by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law, _provided_
that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing.

 

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Foreign
Antitrust Laws and (ii) any Consents of any other applicable Governmental
Authority are obtained, neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action (other than
actions taken in the ordinary course of commercial operations of the business
of Parent or the Company, as applicable, consistent with past practice) that
could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or
the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act and such
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws, or the obtaining of such Consents from any
applicable Governmental Authorities.

 

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 5.05_ shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of the generality of, the matters set forth in _Section
5.03_ and _Section 5.04_.

Parent and its advisors, accountants, attorneys and authorized
representatives to have reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the offices, facilities, assets,

and its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Parent
such financial, tax and operating data and other information with respect to
such Persons and their respective offices, facilities, assets, properties,
employees, businesses and operations as Parent shall from time to time
reasonably request. All access and investigation pursuant to this _Section
5.06_ shall be coordinated through the CompanyÂ’s General Counsel or Chief
Financial Officer (or the designee of either of them) and shall be conducted
at ParentÂ’s expense and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to
(i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege or other immunity or
protection from disclosure of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii)
contravene any Law, (iii) contravene any Contract or any other obligation of
confidentiality; _provided_ , _however_ , that at ParentÂ’s request, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek a waiver of
such contravention or confidentiality obligation to allow access to

representatives not to, contact any distributor, supplier, vendor, customer or
partner of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the business,

past practice; _provided_ that Parent shall not discuss this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (B) Parent shall have no right to
perform any invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or

and effect. Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause their respective
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to hold, any

hereto as _Exhibit B_ , which is being issued by the parties on the date
hereof, and except as required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations
of any applicable stock exchange, in which event the parties shall consult

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan) and
entitlement to benefits, including the determination of the level of vacation
and severance pay benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs,
Contracts and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in which employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall credit each employee with his or her years of
service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and any predecessor Persons, to the
same extent as such employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any similar Parent Plan, except where such
crediting would result in duplication of benefits. The Parent Plans shall not
deny employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions to the extent
such conditions were waived or satisfied under similar Plans immediately
prior to the Closing and shall credit such employees for any deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses in the applicable plan year to which
such deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses relate.

(d) All provisions contained in this _Section 5.09_ are included for the
sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and shall not create any
(i) third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee of the Company or
its Affiliates, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other
Person or (ii) right to continued employment with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained in this
_Section 5.09_ is intended to be or shall be considered to be an amendment or
adoption of any Plan, program, Contract, arrangement or policy of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation nor
shall it interfere with ParentÂ’s, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s or any of the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s SubsidiariesÂ’ right to amend, suspend, modify or
terminate any Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for any reason, _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.09(a)_.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in
no event fewer than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will submit to a stockholder vote (to the extent and in the manner required
under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code) the
right of any individual who is or could reasonably be expected to be, as of
the Closing Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Code) to receive payments and benefits that could be deemed a
"parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code),
_provided_ that, prior to such stockholder vote and in no event fewer than
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date _,_ such disqualified individual
consents to waive his or her right to the parachute payment, in a manner
reasonably designed to cause the payments and benefits that would otherwise
constitute a "parachute payment" to be exempt from the definition of
"parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (such waived rights, the " _Waived 280G Benefits_
"). The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to procure such waivers
from each disqualified individual with respect to his or her rights to the
parachute payments. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of such
waivers and such stockholder vote materials (including disclosure statements
and other materials developed in connection with the stockholder vote) for
ParentÂ’s reasonable review and comment at least five Business Days prior to
delivering such waivers to the disqualified individuals and soliciting such
stockholder approval, and the

 Company shall consider and shall not unreasonably omit any changes or
comments thereto requested by Parent. The Company shall not pay any of the
Waived 280G Benefits if such payment is not approved by the stockholders as
contemplated above. No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence that the stockholder vote
contemplated above was solicited in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.09(e)_.

necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes; _provided_ that 50% of the liability (or, as the case may be,
a reasonable estimate of the liability) for such Transfer Taxes shall be taken
into account for purposes of calculating the Estimated Closing Working Capital
and the Closing Working Capital. The parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to minimize any Transfer Taxes.

documents or instruments as may be required, necessary or desirable in
connection with the (x) redemption of the Debentures as soon as possible
after the Effective Time and (y) satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture

Company will, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or
other agents not to, (i) solicit, encourage, seek, initiate, facilitate or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with or (ii) provide any non-public
information to or enter into any agreement with, in each case, any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates) concerning any purchase
of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock of, any merger or business
combination with, or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of,
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any similar transaction, and shall
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are ongoing and
promptly request the return or destruction of any documents and information
provided to any Person in connection with such discussions. The Company shall

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without first
consulting with Parent, commence or engage with any Works Council in any (x)

engage in a formal consultation or notice process, in each case with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Nothing
herein shall restrict the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
respond to any inquiries from any Works Council or to comply with any

Company using its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with reasonable
notice and, to the extent permitted by Law or as agreed to with the Works
Councils, the opportunity to attend any meetings with the Works Councils and
copies of any relevant document or materials prepared for the attention of, or
issued by, the Works Councils in connection with the dissemination of any
such information. Prior to delivering any such document or materials to the
Works Councils, the Company shall consider in good faith any changes or
comments thereto requested by Parent and shall not include in any such
documents or materials any non-public information regarding Parent or the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents without ParentÂ’s prior
written consent.

59 ##### Table of Contents

  

 operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) take any action
that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation
or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

documents, any applicable Laws, the ABL Credit Agreement, the Indenture or any
other Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a

expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing
or any information used in connection therewith, except with respect to any
material misstatement or omission in any information provided in writing by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection
therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, all Financing Expenses and all Losses,
claims, costs and expenses described in the immediately preceding sentence
shall not constitute Transaction Expenses.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject only to the conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitment. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Company, (A) terminate the Financing
Commitment unless such Financing Commitment is contemporaneously replaced with
a new Financing Commitment or definitive financing agreements that would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or make less likely to
occur the funding of the Financing, or (B) agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any
provision or right under, the Financing Commitment that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or make less likely to occur the funding
of the Financing on the Closing Date. Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within two Business Days) deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver to or under the Financing
Commitment.

 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing

of the definitive agreements and any other material documents relating to the
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (and, in
any event, within two Business Days) of the occurrence of any event or
development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment.

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitment, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents with terms and

 conditions not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all Contracts relating to such alternative
financing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment as permitted

reasonably practicable, of the Losses that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_, the Indemnifying Parties
will be entitled, by providing notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the
defense and control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Parties). If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense
and control of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may retain a
single separate counsel (and one counsel in each relevant local jurisdiction)
at its own expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim,
but the Indemnifying Parties shall control the defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Parties do not assume the defense and control of
the Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_, the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense (at the expense of
the Indemnified Party), but the Indemnifying Parties may nonetheless retain a
single separate counsel (and one counsel in each relevant local jurisdiction)
at their own expense and participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Each Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Parties in the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records,
personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party
Claim. The party assuming the defense and control of a Third Party Claim shall
select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and
competence and shall use its reasonable best efforts in the defense or
settlement of such Third Party Claim. In no event shall any Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates admit any liability to any third party in connection
with any matter which is the subject of a Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Parties have assumed the defense and control of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the consent of the Indemnified Party unless (i) such judgment or settlement
does not involve any equitable relief, encumber any assets of any Indemnified
Party or result in a finding or admission of any violation of Law
or admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnifying
Parties pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment,
and (iii) the Indemnifying Parties obtain, in customary form, a complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party affected by such Third Party
Claim with respect to the matters which are the subject of such Third Party
Claim.

 

(c) Any Direct Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the
Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written

 



66 ##### Table of Contents

  

 notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Parties of their
indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Parties are prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Losses
that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Parties shall have 20 Business Days after receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. During such 20 Business Day period, the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Parties and their Affiliates
and advisors to engage in a reasonable investigation of the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying PartiesÂ’ investigation
by providing such information and assistance (including by furnishing books
and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate) as the Indemnifying
Parties may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Parties do not so respond
within such 20 Business Day period, the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed
to have rejected such claim.

(d) Whenever the Sellers and Option Holders are Indemnifying Parties, the
Indemnifying Parties shall coordinate with each other, and any action required
to be taken by the Indemnifying Parties shall be taken on behalf of all such
Persons by the Majority Sellers. All actions, decisions and instructions of
the Majority Sellers under this _Article VIII_ shall be conclusive and binding
upon all of the Sellers and Option Holders. No Seller or Option Holder shall
have any cause of action against the Majority Sellers, and the Majority
Sellers shall have no liability whatsoever to any other Seller or Option
Holder, for any action taken or not taken, decision made or instruction given
by the Majority Sellers under this Agreement. The Majority Sellers may incur
Dispute Expenses on behalf of the Sellers and Option Holders in connection
with any dispute arising under this _Article VIII_ , and each Seller and
Option Holder shall be responsible for its Fully Diluted Pro Rata
Share thereof. Parent and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation) may rely exclusively, without independent verification
or investigation, upon all actions, decisions and instructions of the Majority
Sellers under this Article VIII. Parent or its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to deal exclusively
with the Majority Sellers on all matters relating to this Article VIII and may
disregard any decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed
by any Seller or Option Holder in connection with this Article VIII unless the
same is made, given or executed by the Majority Sellers.

 

Section 8.04 _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 

(a) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ in
respect of any Losses shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim, net of any deductible or any
other expenses, including Taxes (but, in the case of any currently deductible
Loss, only to the extent that the Taxes incurred by the Indemnified Party
exceed the Taxes such Indemnified Party would have incurred if the Losses
covered by insurance had never occurred) incurred by the Indemnified Party in
obtaining such third-party payment; _provided_ that, if the insurance proceeds
are received by the Indemnified Party after such time payment has been made by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent such
proceeds, when added to the indemnity payment, exceed the amount of the
relevant Loss, promptly remit such excess proceeds to the Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to recover under
insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for
any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, (i) the
indemnification obligations of any Seller or Option Holder under this 
_Article VIII_ with respect to any Losses shall in no event exceed the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration actually

 



67 ##### Table of Contents

  

 received by such Seller or such Option Holder, (ii) the cumulative
indemnification obligation of the Sellers and the Option Holders under this
_Article VIII_ with respect to any Losses shall in no event exceed the
Aggregate Purchase Price in the aggregate, (iii) the cumulative
indemnification obligation of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Article VIII_ with respect to any Losses shall in no event exceed the
Aggregate Purchase Price in the aggregate and (iv) the indemnification
obligations of any Seller or Option Holder under this _Article VIII_ shall not
include any Losses, and no claim for indemnification for any Losses shall be
made by any Parent Indemnified Party, to the extent such Losses (A) were
taken into account in the determination of Closing Working Capital or Closing
Cash, in each case as reflected in the Final Closing Statement or (B)
otherwise resulted in a reduction of the Aggregate Purchase Price.

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ in respect of
any Losses shall be reduced by an amount equal to any actual cash Tax benefit
reasonably expected to inure to the Indemnified Parties as a result of such
Losses (and that would not have inured in the absence of such Losses and that
is not taken into account in calculating Taxes for purposes of _Section
8.04(a)_ above) within three years of the date such Losses are incurred.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable actions to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance giving rise thereto.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall an Indemnifying Party have any obligation to indemnify any
Indemnified Party from and against consequential or special damages.

Section 8.05  _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the indemnification
provided in this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all matters arising out of, resulting from or relating to
the Transaction Agreements, the Company or its Subsidiaries, their respective
assets, liabilities and equity interests, and the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreements, except with respect to claims (a) under common law
based solely upon the actual fraud of another party hereto and (b) relating
to breaches of post-Closing covenants.

Section 9.02 _Amendment; Waiver, Etc._ Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, modification or supplement, by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company,
or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this agreement, _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ , _Section
9.02_,  _Section 9.03_, _Section 9.06_, _Section 9.08(b)_ and _Section
9.08(c)_ (in each case, together with any related definitions to the extent an
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver with respect to such definition
would serve to modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended,
modified, supplemented or waived in a manner that is adverse to any Financing
Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 

Section 9.03 _Assignment_. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other parties, and any attempt to assign this Agreement without such
consent shall be void and of no effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another wholly owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary to be Merger Sub in lieu of Comet Merger Co., in
which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made
herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that (x) any such
designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) Parent will be liable for
any damages incurred as a result of such designation to the Sellers,
the Company or any of its Affiliates and (b) at and after the Closing, Parent
may assign its rights under this Agreement as collateral security to the
Persons providing the Financing.

 

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters.

 

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.06 _Parties in Interest_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
provided in _Section 9.06(b)_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective successors
or permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the right of the Company, on behalf of the holders of
Capital Stock of the Company, to pursue damages and other relief if there is
any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, which right is hereby
acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub.

(b) The limitations in  _Section 9.06(a)_ shall not apply to the provisions
of:

(i) _Section 2.07_, _Section 2.12,_ _Section 2.14,_ _Section 2.15_ and
_Section 5.10_, to the extent they apply to holders of shares of Common Stock
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, which holders shall be express
third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such
sections;

(ii) _Section 2.08_, _Section 2.14_ and _Section 2.15_, to the extent they
apply to Option Holders, which holders shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such sections;

 

(iii) _Section 5.08_, to the extent it applies to DandO Indemnified Persons,
which DandO Indemnified Persons shall be express third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to rely on, such section;

(iv) _Article VIII_ , to the extent it applies to Parent Indemnified Parties
or Seller Indemnified Parties, which Parent Indemnified Parties and Seller
Indemnified Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall
be entitled to rely on, such section;

 

(v) _Section 9.13_, to the extent it applies to Proskauer, which shall be an
express third-party beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to rely on, such
section;

Parent Released Persons, which Seller Released Persons and Parent Released
Persons shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled

Sources, which Persons shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and
shall be entitled to rely on, such sections.

 

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.06_, no Person shall be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.07 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be

Section 9.08 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement, and any Litigation in any way arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the legal relationship of
the parties (whether at law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise), shall be governed by and enforced pursuant to the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to rules of conflict of Laws that
would result in the application of Laws of any other jurisdiction. Each party
hereby irrevocably agrees and consents to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware situated in
New Castle County and any State of Delaware appellate court therefrom or, to
the extent the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware situated in New
Castle County does not have subject matter jurisdiction or declines to accept
personal jurisdiction over any party, any state or federal court within New
Castle County in the State of Delaware and any appellate court therefrom
(collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ ") in any Litigation described in the
immediately preceding sentence of this 
_Section 9.08(a)_ that is brought by any such party or its successors or
assigns. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process
in any such Litigation by the delivery of such process in the manner provided
in _Section 9.01_. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any Litigation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the legal relationship of
the parties (whether at law or in equity, and whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise) in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court
that any such Litigation brought in any Chosen Court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that it will not bring or support, or
permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any Litigation (including
any cross-claim or third-party claim) of any kind or description, whether at
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, in
any forum other than the Chosen Courts, and that the provisions of _Section
9.08(b)_ relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
Litigation. Each party further agrees that any final and nonappealable
judgment against any of them in any Litigation described in the first sentence
of this _Section 9.08(a)_ shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on judgment, a
certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of
such judgment. The provisions of this _Section 9.08(a)_ shall be subject to
any contrary provisions of _Section 9.08(c)_ below, solely with respect to
the subject matter covered in such _Section 9.08(c)_.

(b) Any controversy that may arise under or relate to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby is likely to involve complicated and
difficult issues; therefore each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Litigation
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Financing, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the legal
relationship between the parties (whether at law or in equity, and whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise). Each party certifies and acknowledges that
(i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, if there is any
Litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) such party understands
and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes
this waiver voluntarily and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section 9.08(b)_.

 



72 ##### Table of Contents

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company, to the fullest
extent lawful (on behalf of itself and its pre-Closing controlled Affiliates
and its and their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
representatives and agents) (i) hereby waives any and all rights or claims any
of them may have against any Financing Source (whether based in contract,
tort, fraud, strict liability, other laws or otherwise) arising under or
related to this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitment or any
related transaction, (ii) hereby agrees that no Financing Source shall have
any liability or obligations of any kind (whether based in contract, tort,
fraud, strict liability, other laws or otherwise) to the Company, its pre-
Closing controlled Affiliates and its and their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, representatives and agents arising under or related to
this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitment or any related
transaction and (iii) hereby agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its pre-Closing controlled Affiliates and its and their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, representatives and agents not to,
institute any legal proceeding against any Financing Source (whether based in
contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other laws or otherwise) arising
under or related to this Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitment or
any related transaction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 9.08(c)_ and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of the
parties further agrees that it will not bring or support any Litigation of any
kind (whether based in contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other Laws or
otherwise) involving any Financing Source arising under or related to this
Agreement, the Financing or the Financing Commitment in any forum other than
any state or federal court sitting in The City of New York, Borough of
Manhattan (and each further agrees that any Litigation involving any
Financing Sources shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles which would result in
the application of the laws of another state).

 

Section 9.09 _Counterparts, Etc._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other party. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email in "portable document
format" (".pdf") form, or by other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

 Section 9.10 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, from time to time, at the request of any party and, except as
otherwise set forth herein, at the expense of the party so requesting, each
other party shall execute and deliver to such requesting party such documents
and take such other action as such requesting party may reasonably request in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 9.11 _Remedies_. The provisions of this Agreement are uniquely related
to the desire of the parties and their respective Affiliates to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, and the transactions contemplated hereby
represent a unique business opportunity at a unique time for each of the
parties and their respective Affiliates; therefore the parties agree that

 



73 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (i) irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its terms (including failing to take such
actions as are required hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and, (ii) although monetary
damages may be available for the breach of such covenants and undertakings,
monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, each
party agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that if the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, breached or
threatened to breach any provision of this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any such order or injunction, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the provision,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. If any Litigation
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party shall allege, and each party waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy at law. The rights in this _Section 9.11_ are in addition to
any other remedy to which a party hereto may be entitled at law or in equity,
and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise
of any other remedy.

Section 9.12 _Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "knowledge" of
the Company means the actual knowledge of the Persons listed on _Schedule
9.12(a)_ and (b) "knowledge" of Parent or Merger Sub means the actual
knowledge of the Persons listed on _Schedule 9.12(b)_.

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Proskauer has acted as
legal counsel to the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the direct and
indirect holders of shares of Common Stock and certain of their respective
Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Proskauer intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders of shares of
Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (which will no longer include the
Company and its Subsidiaries) after the Closing, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with Proskauer representing any direct
or indirect holders of the shares of Common Stock or their Affiliates after
the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between direct and indirect holders of
shares of Common Stock, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Proskauer, on the other hand, relating to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements shall be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of
shares of Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Proskauer relating to such engagement from
and after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,

 



74 ##### Table of Contents

  

 from and after the Effective Time, (a) the direct and indirect holders of
shares of Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent
that files of Proskauer in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only the direct and indirect holders of shares of Common Stock and
their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (c) Proskauer shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Proskauer and the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is waiving any attorney-
client privilege (including relating to the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements) in connection with any third-party Litigation.

 Section 9.14 _Disclaimer_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
(a) the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in
_Article III_ or in any other Transaction Agreement or certificate delivered
pursuant to the terms thereof constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties made with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (b) except for the
representations and warranties referred to in clause (a) above, none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any other Person has made or is making any
express or implied representations or warranty, statutory or otherwise, of
any nature, including with respect to any express or implied representation or
warranty as to the merchantability, quality, quantity, suitability or fitness
for any particular purpose of the business or the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (c) except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_ or in any other Transaction Agreement or
certificate delivered pursuant to the terms thereof, all other warranties,
express or implied, statutory or otherwise, of any nature, including with
respect to any express or implied representation or warranty as to the
merchantability, quality, quantity, suitability or fitness for any particular
purpose of the business or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
are hereby expressly disclaimed. Parent and Merger Sub represent, warrant,
covenant and agree, that (i) in determining to enter into and consummate this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements,
they are not relying upon, and have not been induced by, any representation or
warranty made or purportedly made by or on behalf of any Person, other than
those expressly made by the Company as set forth in _Article III_  or in any
other Transaction Agreement or certificate delivered pursuant to the terms
thereof, and (ii) any estimate, projection forecast, plan, budget or other
prediction, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or
offering materials or presentations, including any memoranda and materials
