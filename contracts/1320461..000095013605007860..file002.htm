W I T N E S S E T H:    WHEREAS, certain Subsidiaries of ITT are engaged, in part or in whole, in the Business (as defined in Annex A hereto); and   WHEREAS, Purchaser, directly and through one or more of its Subsidiaries, desires to purchase, and ITT desires to sell, and to cause (i) its Subsidiaries listed on Exhibit A (collectively with ITT, the "Entity Sellers") and any nominee holders therefor to sell to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser designated by Purchaser at least two days prior to the Closing (the "Designated Entity Purchasers"), on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries of ITT listed on part 1 of Exhibit A (such shares, the "Transferred Subsidiary Stock") and all of the partnership interests in the Subsidiaries of ITT listed on part 2 of Exhibit A (the "Partnership Interests") (such purchase, the "Entity Purchase") and (ii) its Subsidiaries listed on Exhibit C (collectively with ITT, the "Asset Sellers" and, together with the Entity Sellers, collectively the "Sellers") to sell to Purchaser or the Subsidiary of Purchaser set forth on Exhibit C (the "Designated Asset Purchasers" and, together with the Designated Entity Purchasers, the "Designated Purchasers"), on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, certain assets and certain liabilities of the Asset Sellers as specified in this Agreement (such purchase, the "Asset Purchase" and, together with the Entity Purchase, the "Purchase"); and   WHEREAS, capitalized terms used and not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in Annex A hereto; and   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   SALE AND TRANSFER OF TRANSFERRED SUBSIDIARY STOCK AND PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   1.1. Sale and Transfer of Transferred Subsidiary Stock and Partnership Interests. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and as of the Closing Date, ITT shall or shall cause the applicable Entity Sellers (including any persons holding shares in the Transferred Subsidiaries on behalf of the Entity Sellers) to sell,      2  assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the applicable Designated Entity Purchasers, and Purchaser shall or shall cause the applicable Designated Entity Purchasers to purchase and acquire, all the Transferred Subsidiary Stock and all the Partnership Interests. In connection therewith, (i) ITT shall or shall cause the applicable Entity Sellers to deliver to the applicable Designated Entity Purchasers (with respect to Transferred Subsidiaries which have issued stock certificates) certificates representing the Transferred Subsidiary Stock, duly endorsed, or accompanied by stock powers duly executed, with all necessary stock transfer stamps attached thereto and canceled, and such other evidence of the Partnership Interests and the Transferred Subsidiary Stock (with respect to Transferred Subsidiaries which have not issued stock certificates), and (ii) the applicable Entity Seller and any nominee therefor and the applicable Designated Entity Purchaser shall execute, deliver and/or file such other assignments, deeds, share transfer forms, endorsements, notarial deeds of transfer or other instruments or documents, duly stamped where necessary, as required by the jurisdiction of organization of each Transferred Subsidiary and all other documents related to the Transferred Subsidiary Stock or the Partnership Interests as Purchaser may reasonably request to effectuate such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery. Schedule 1.1 lists the conveyance or transfer documents to be executed, delivered and/or filed at Closing in order to effect each transfer of Transferred Subsidiary Stock or Partnership Interests.   ARTICLE II   SALE OF ASSETS AND ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES  --------------------------------------------   2.1. Sale of Assets. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and as of the Closing Date, ITT shall or shall cause the applicable Asset Sellers to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the applicable Designated Asset Purchasers, and Purchaser shall or shall cause the applicable Designated Asset Purchasers to purchase and acquire, all of the Asset Sellers\' right, title and interest in the Purchased Assets.   As of the Closing, risk of loss as to the Purchased Assets shall pass from the Asset Sellers to Purchaser except as may otherwise be provided herein.   2.2. Assumption of Liabilities; Excluded Liabilities. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and shall agree to pay, perform and discharge when due, all liabilities and obligations of the Asset Sellers relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets other than the Excluded Liabilities (as defined below), whether fixed, absolute, matured, unmatured, accrued or contingent, now existing or arising after the date hereof, including all liabilities and obligations under the Contracts assigned pursuant to Section 2.1 to the extent such Contracts are assigned, including to the extent such liabilities and obligations are unpaid, undelivered or unperformed on the Closing Date (the "Assumed Liabilities"). It is expressly agreed that the Asset Sellers will retain, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries shall assume, the liabilities described in Exhibit E (collectively, the "Excluded Liabilities").       3   2.3. Transfer of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities.  -----------------------------------------------------   (a) The Purchased Assets shall be sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, and the Assumed Liabilities shall be assumed, pursuant to transfer and assumption agreements or other instruments in such form as is necessary to effect a conveyance of the Purchased Assets and an assumption of the Assumed Liabilities in the jurisdictions in which such transfers are to be made, and which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and ITT, to be executed (upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof) on the Closing Date by the applicable Asset Seller and the applicable Designated Asset Purchaser, and such other conveyance, transfer and assumption documents as may be required in such jurisdictions to effect the conveyance of all right, title and interest in the applicable Purchased Assets. Schedule 2.3(a) lists the conveyance, transfer and assumption documents to be executed, delivered and/or filed at Closing in connection with the Asset Purchase in each such jurisdiction.   (b) With respect to the French branch of ITT Automotive Europe GmbH and Co. KG ("ITTAE"), (i) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, ITTAE and the applicable Designated Asset Purchaser shall execute the French Implementing Agreements in the forms set forth in Schedule 2.3(b)(i) and (ii) on the Closing Date ITTAE and the applicable Designated Asset Purchaser shall execute the French Implementing Agreements in the forms set forth in Schedule 2.3(b)(ii) in order to effect the transfer of title to the Purchased Assets and the assumption of Assumed Liabilities to which the French Implementing Agreements relate. To the extent of any inconsistency, the terms hereof shall prevail over the terms in the French Implementing Agreements. No Seller or any applicable Designated Purchaser shall bring any claim based on the French Implementing Agreements unless the claim is solely related to perfecting or recording the transfer of title to any applicable Designated Purchaser in the relevant Purchased Assets or the assumption of relevant Assumed Liabilities by the applicable Designated Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   2.4. Required Consents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery or attempted sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery to any Designated Purchaser of any Purchased Asset (including any Contract) or the transfer of any Business Employee is prohibited by any applicable law or would require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery, or an attempted sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery thereof if any of the foregoing would constitute a breach of applicable law or the rights of any third party; provided, however, that, except to the extent that a condition to closing set forth in Article VII relating to the foregoing shall not be satisfied, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account of such required authorization, approval, consent, negative clearance or waiver. Following the Closing, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents, negative clearances or waivers; provided, however, that neither ITT nor Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to pay any consideration therefor or waive any rights in connection therewith, other than filing,        4   recordation or similar fees payable to any Governmental Authority, which fees shall be shared equally by ITT and Purchaser. Pending or in the absence of such authorization, approval, consent, negative clearance or waiver, the parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to the applicable Designated Purchaser the benefits and liabilities of use of such Purchased Asset. If such authorization, approval, consent, negative consent or waiver for the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery of any such Purchased Asset is obtained, ITT shall cause the applicable Asset Seller to promptly convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, such Purchased Asset to such Designated Purchaser.   ARTICLE III   PURCHASE PRICE AND ADJUSTMENTS  ------------------------------   3.1. Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Transferred Subsidiary Stock, the Partnership Interests and the Purchased Assets shall be an amount (the "Purchase Price") equal to U.S. $205,000,000.00 (two hundred five million U.S. dollars) (the "Initial Purchase Price") plus or minus the difference between the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital (as defined in Section 3.3(a)(i)(C)) and the Target Net Working Capital.   3.2. Payment of Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to ITT the Initial Purchase Price. Such amount shall be payable in United States dollars in immediately available federal funds to such bank account or accounts, in the United States, as shall be designated by ITT no later than the second Business Day prior to the Closing.   3.3. Determination of Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital.   (a) Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital shall be determined following the Closing Date as follows:   (i) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than 90 days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to ITT a statement of adjusted Net Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working Capital Statement") which shall be presented in the same three-column format as the Reference Net Working Capital Statement. As used in this Agreement, "Net Working Capital" means the current assets less the current liabilities of the Business, excluding (w) cash and cash equivalents, (x) deferred income tax assets/liabilities (y) income tax receivables/payables and (z) financial indebtedness. The Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods that were employed in preparing the Financial Statements and the Reference Net Working Capital Statement and shall present:   (A) in column 1, a statement of Net Working Capital as of  immediately prior to the Closing;       5    (B) in column 2, (1) (x) the assets of the FHS Companies  in column 1 which are retained by the Sellers in accordance with the  terms of this Agreement and (y) the assets of the Asset Sellers in  column 1 which are not Purchased Assets and (2) (x) the liabilities of  the FHS Companies in column 1 which are Excluded FHS Company  Liabilities and (y) the liabilities of the Asset Sellers in column 1  which are Excluded Liabilities (including, for the avoidance of doubt,  any deferred tax liabilities); and   (C) in column 3, an amount equal to the amount in column 1  less the amount in column 2 (Net Working Capital shown in column 3,  the "Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital").   Column 1 of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement  shall present fairly in all material respects Net Working Capital as it  would appear in a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date  in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  applied on a basis consistent with the Financial Statements ("GAAP")  (subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(b)). ITT shall cooperate  fully with Purchaser in the preparation of the Closing Net Working  Capital Statement.   (b) In preparing the Closing Net Working Capital Statement: (i) the parties shall assume that the Business will continue as a going concern at its present locations; (ii) the reserves for loss contracts will be determined as described in Schedule 3.3(b); (iii) the reserves for warranties will be determined as described in Schedule 3.3(b); (iv) the reserves for liabilities in respect of compliance with Environmental Laws will be determined as described in Schedule 3.3(b); and (v) the reserves for the workers\' compensation liabilities will be determined as described in Schedule 3.3(b). The Financial Statements, Interim Financial Statements and the Reference Net Working Capital Statement have been prepared using the same assumptions.   (c) ITT may dispute the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as shown on the Closing Net Working Capital Statement by notifying Purchaser in writing within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement. During such 30-day period employees of ITT shall be entitled to access to the work papers of Purchaser and its accountants prepared in connection with the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and shall be entitled to review and discuss such work papers with Purchaser and its accountants. Any notice delivered in accordance with this Section 3.3(c) shall specify the amount of the proposed adjustment for each item in dispute and the substance of any disagreement so asserted, which disagreement shall not relate to the principles, policies, methods and procedures underlying such calculation (so long as such principles, policies, methods and procedures are in accordance with GAAP and are not inconsistent with those used in preparing the Financial Statements). If ITT does not so notify Purchaser within such period, the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as shown on the Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If ITT does so notify Purchaser, Purchaser and ITT shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.       6   (d) If Purchaser and ITT are unable to reach a resolution with respect to all of the items specified in the notice referred to in Section 3.3(c) within 20 days after the date of receipt by Purchaser of such notice, then either party may submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to KPMG or to such other accounting firm of international recognition mutually acceptable to Purchaser and ITT other than public accountants used by ITT or Purchaser (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). At a reasonable time and place in advance of a hearing before the Independent Accounting Firm: (i) Purchaser and ITT shall each make available to the other all business records or documents in its respective possession, custody or control that the other party believes in good faith to be relevant to the resolution of any disputed amounts; and, (ii) Purchaser and ITT shall make available for examination any current employee, advisor or agent that the other party believes in good faith to have information relevant to any disputed amount. Based upon the information provided to it by Purchaser and ITT and such other information as the Independent Accounting Firm deems appropriate, the Independent Accounting Firm shall within a reasonable period of time determine and report to ITT and Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. No adjustment to the calculation of Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital shall be made unless the amount of such adjustment exceeds $100,000. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne half by Purchaser and half by ITT.   3.4. Settlement of Purchase Price.   (a) If the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c) or (d) exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall, within five Business Days after such final determination, pay such excess to ITT.   (b) If the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 3.3(c) or (d) is less than the Target Net Working Capital, ITT shall, within five Business Days after such final determination, pay such difference to Purchaser.   (c) The party making such payment pursuant to Section 3.4(a) or 3.4(b), as the case may be, shall pay interest thereon to the other party for the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of six months appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate screen on the Closing Date plus 25 basis points. Payment of such excess (or difference) and interest thereon shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account or accounts as are designated in writing by the party entitled to receive such payment no later than the second Business Day prior to the date on which such payment is due. No item forming the basis of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall serve as the basis for any claim for indemnification under Article IX.   3.5. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price allocations among the Purchased Assets and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be made in a manner consistent with the allocations set forth on part 1 of Exhibit I. The parties will negotiate in good faith to agree on or before the Closing Date to a further allocation of the Purchase Price allocated to Sellers in Canada, France and the United States (as set forth on part 1 of Exhibit I) among the respective Transferred Subsidiaries and Purchased Assets. Such further allocation, if agreed, shall be set       7  forth on part 2 of Exhibit I (such further allocation the, "Detailed Allocation"). For the purposes of all Taxes, Purchaser and ITT agree to report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the allocations under this Section 3.5 and Exhibit I, and that none of them will take any position inconsistent with such allocations on any Tax Return without the consent of the other party except as required by applicable law or as required by a final "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code; provided, however, that if the parties are unable to reach agreement as to a further allocation of the Purchase Price allocated to Sellers in Canada, France and the United States among the respective Transferred Subsidiaries and Purchased Assets, each shall file its Tax Returns as it determines proper, but in any case consistent with part 1 of Exhibit I. For purposes of Taxes in Canada, Purchaser and ITT agree that the Purchase Price of the Purchased Assets sold by ITT Industries of Canada L.P. ("ITT Canada") shall include the aggregate amount of accounts payable and other indebtedness, if any, which are Assumed Liabilities in respect of the Purchased Assets sold by ITT Canada and that none of them will take any position inconsistent with such allocations on any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise, without the consent of the other party.   If the Detailed Allocation is agreed to, Purchaser shall prepare an allocation schedule of Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities among the classes of Purchased Assets, in accordance with the rules under Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, along with the first draft of any form required by any foreign jurisdiction to report such allocations which is necessitated by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Purchased Assets, which shall be sent to ITT at the earlier of (i) 30 days following agreement between the parties as to the Closing Net Working Capital Statement or (ii) 90 days prior to the due date, including extensions, for filing the applicable foreign income tax return for the taxable year in which the Closing takes place, all such forms to be consistent with the Detailed Allocation. Within 30 days after the receipt of such allocation schedule, ITT shall propose any changes to such allocation schedule or shall indicate its concurrence therewith, which concurrence will not be unreasonably withheld. If ITT shall propose any changes to such allocation schedule, Purchaser shall have 30 days to review such changes and indicate concurrence therewith, which concurrence will not be unreasonably withheld.

(ii) Any U.S. Salaried Transitioned Employee who is Long Term Disabled as of the Closing Date shall continue to receive, while eligible, Long Term Disability benefits under the plan of the U.S. Business Welfare Benefits program providing Long Term Disability income benefits ("U.S. LTD Plan") subject to and according to the terms of the U.S. LTD Plan.

(i) As of the Effective Benefits Time, Purchaser will, or will cause a U.S. FHS Company to, assume all of ITT\'s obligations and succeed to all the ITT\'s rights under the Hourly Savings Plans with respect to any U.S. Hourly Transitioned Employee and any U.S. Hourly Former Business Employee by adopting, or by causing a U.S. FHS Company to remain the sponsor of, as of the Effective Benefits Time, the Hourly Savings Plans and assuming, or causing a U.S. FHS Company to assume or to remain the contracting employer with respect to the existing group annuity insurance contracts issued by Hartford Life Insurance Company pursuant to which the certain assets of the Hourly Savings Plans are held and invested.

(iii) As soon as practicable and upon receipt by ITT and Northern Trust of copies of (A) an opinion of Purchaser\'s tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to ITT and Northern Trust confirming that the establishment and operation of the Hourly Savings Plans Trust do not adversely affect the qualification of the Hourly Savings Plans and that, upon submission to the Internal Revenue Service of the Hourly Savings Plans Trust, it is expected that the Hourly Savings Plans and the Hourly Savings Plans Trust will continue to be tax qualified, or (B) a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to the Hourly Savings Plans Trust, and upon satisfaction by Purchaser of the reasonable and customary requirements of Northern Trust, ITT will, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, cause Northern Trust to transfer in kind all such assets then held in trust by Northern Trust as of the date of transfer for usual and ordinary fees and expenses, including any charges for trustees fees, and benefit payments, with respect to Hourly Savings Plans and such trust arrangements.      36    (iv) ITT agrees that, from the Closing Date until the transfer as provided in Section 6.6(g)(iii) the assets of the Hourly Savings Plan held in trust by Northern Trust will be made available for benefits payments and other usual and ordinary fees and expenses, under such Plan and trust arrangement, in accordance with the terms of such Plan and trust arrangement.

(h) Hourly Pension Plans - United States. Section 6.6(i), "Transfer of Hourly Pension Plans-United States", shall be operative if either (x) prior to the Closing, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") shall have approved the transfer of the Hourly Pension Plans as contemplated in Section 6.6(i) or (y) PBGC shall have taken no action to terminate the Hourly Pension Plans. Purchaser agrees to cooperate with ITT to provide any and all information requested by PBGC in connection with the PBGC\'s review of the proposed transfer of the Hourly Pension Plans subject to receipt of standard confidentiality agreement from PBGC. In the event ITT shall determine, in its sole discretion, that the transfer of the Hourly Pension Plans cannot be effectuated without the PBGC threatening to take action to prevent such transfer or to terminate such Hourly Pension Plans without (i) the assumption of obligations or the incurrence of other liabilities to the PBGC or the Hourly Pension Plans by ITT, in the form of guarantees to the PBGC or otherwise, and/or (ii) the contribution of additional trust assets to the Hourly Pension Plans in an amount satisfactory to the PBGC (any such threatened action, a "PBGC Action"), and ITT further determines, also in its sole discretion, not to assume such obligations, incur such liabilities or make such additional contributions, then Section 6.6(i) shall not be operative and in place thereof Section 6.6(j), "Retention of Hourly Pension Plans - United States", shall be operative.   (i) Transfer of Hourly Pension Plans- United States. If, prior to the Effective Benefits Time, no PBGC Action has occurred and the PBGC has not otherwise taken any action to terminate the Hourly Pension Plans then:   (i) As of the Effective Benefits Time, Purchaser will, or will cause a U.S. FHS Company to, assume all ITT\'s obligations and succeed to all ITT\'s rights under the Hourly Pension Plans with respect to any U.S. Hourly Business Employees and any U.S. Hourly Former Business Employees by adopting, or by causing a U.S. FHS Company to remain sponsor of, as of the Effective Benefits Time, the Hourly Pension Plans and by establishing trusts therefor.   (ii) Participation in the Hourly Pension Plans, as adopted by Purchaser, by U.S. Hourly Business Employees shall not be deemed terminated nor shall their employment       37   be deemed otherwise interrupted for purposes of the Hourly Pension Plans as adopted by Purchaser, by reason of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement.   (iii) (A) The assets of the Hourly Pension Plans are presently held in trust in the Investment Master Trust of ITT Industries, Inc. (the "Industries Master Trust") and the assets of the Hourly Pension Plans are identified for accounting purposes in accounts in the Industries Master Trust (the "Plan Accounts"). Northern Trust is presently trustee under said trust. From and after the Closing Date and until the transfer as hereinafter provided in Section 6.6(i)(iv) such assets shall continue to be held in the Plan Accounts, upon the terms hereinafter provided.   (B) ITT will cause Northern Trust to value, in a manner consistent with prior practice with respect to the Plan Accounts (based on the most recent valuation data available to and used by Northern Trust as of the Valuation Date, as hereinafter defined), the assets of the Hourly Pension Plans as of the last day of the month in which the Closing Date occurs ("Valuation Date") based on the value of the assets held by the Plan Accounts.   (C) As soon as practicable after the Valuation Date, ITT will cause Northern Trust to invest the following specified amount of the assets held in the Plan Accounts in cash or cash equivalents: an amount equal to the value of the Plan Accounts as of the Valuation Date as then estimated by Northern Trust ("Estimated Value"), such amount to be increased by interest for the period from the Valuation Date to the date the assets held in the Plan Accounts are invested in cash or cash equivalents, such interest to be equal to the interest earned for such period for a like amount invested in the Short Term Investment Fund of Northern Trust used for investment of short term investments held in the Industries Master Trust ("Northern STIF").   (D) As soon as practicable after Northern Trust has determined the actual value of the Plan Accounts as of the Valuation Date ("Actual Value"), ITT will cause Northern Trust to invest the following specified amount of the assets held in the Plan Accounts in cash or cash equivalents: an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Actual Value over the Estimated Value, such amount of excess to be increased by interest for the period from the Valuation Date to the date such specified amounts of assets held in the Plan Accounts are invested in cash or cash equivalents, such interest to be equal to the interest earned for such period for a like amount invested in the Northern STIF, less any adjustments by Northern Trust as of the date of transfer for usual and ordinary fees and expenses, including any charges for trustee fees, actuarial fees, PBGC premiums and benefit payments, with respect to the Hourly Pension Plans and the Plan Accounts. If the amount of the Actual Value is less than the Estimated Value, ITT will cause Northern Trust to reduce assets held in the Plan Accounts by transferring assets held in the Plan Accounts to the commingled assets held in the Industries Master Trust in an amount equal to the difference between the Actual Value and the Estimated Value, such amount to be increased in accordance with the method of adjustment described in this Section 6.6(i)(iii)(D).       38    (E) All such cash or cash equivalents held in the Plan Accounts shall be invested in the Northern STIF pending the transfer provided in Section 6.6(i)(iv).   (iv) (A) Purchaser will establish trusts for the Hourly Pension Plans with such trustee as Purchaser may designate (the "Purchaser\'s Trusts"). Purchaser shall take such action as shall be necessary to qualify the Hourly Pension Plans as adopted by Purchaser and to qualify Purchaser\'s Trusts under the Code and shall take such other actions in connection therewith as may be required by ERISA.   (B) As soon as practicable and upon receipt by ITT and Northern Trust of copies of an opinion of Purchaser\'s tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to ITT and Northern Trust confirming that the establishment and operation of the Purchaser\'s Trusts do not adversely affect the qualification of the Hourly Pension Plans and that, upon submission to the Internal Revenue Service of the Purchaser\'s Trusts, it is expected that the Hourly Pension Plans and the Purchaser\'s Trusts will continue to be tax qualified, or favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to the Hourly Pension Plans as adopted by Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Trusts, and upon satisfaction by Purchaser of the reasonable and customary requirements of Northern Trust, ITT will, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, cause Northern Trust to transfer as cash all such assets then held in the Plan Accounts to Purchaser\'s Trusts, less any adjustments by Northern Trust as of the date of transfer for usual and ordinary fees and expenses, including any charges for trustees fees, actuarial fees, PBGC premiums and benefit payments, with respect to the Hourly Pension Plans and the Plan Accounts.   (v) ITT agrees that, from the Closing Date until the transfer as provided in Section 6.6(i)(iv), the assets of the Hourly Pension Plans held in the Plan Accounts will be made available for benefits payments and other usual and ordinary fees and expenses, under such Plans and Plan Accounts, in accordance with the terms of such Plans and Plan Accounts.   (vi) Subsequent to the transfer of assets provided in Section 6.6(i)(iv), any payment of benefits to U.S. Hourly Transitioned Employees, deferred vested U.S. Hourly Former Business Employees, Disabled U.S. Hourly Former Business Employees and retired U.S. Hourly Former Business Employees and any payment of other usual and ordinary fees and expenses under the Hourly Pension Plans and the Plan Accounts shall be made by the Hourly Pension Plans as adopted by Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Trusts.   (j) Retention of Hourly Pension Plans - United States. If ITT, in its sole discretion, determines that the Hourly Pension Plans cannot be transferred to Purchaser without the PBGC taking a PBGC Action or taking action to terminate such Hourly Pension Plans then:   (i) Purchaser shall not assume any of the liabilities and obligations of the Hourly Pension Plans and ITT shall retain all such liabilities and obligations and related assets under the Hourly Pension Plans.   (ii) (A) Purchaser agrees that it will or will cause a U.S. FHS Company to establish tax qualified defined benefit pension plans, effective as of the Effective       39   Benefits Time, identical to the Hourly Pension Plans in all material respects other than the substitution of Purchaser, or a U.S. FHS Company, as sponsoring employer ("Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans").   (B) Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans shall recognize all service rendered by U.S. Hourly Transitioned Employees prior to the Effective Benefits Time which is recognized under the terms of the Hourly Pension Plans for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting, including, without limitation, eligibility service for purposes of determining eligibility for plan membership, pre-retirement spousal benefits, early retirement benefits, disability retirement benefits and normal retirement benefits.   (C) Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans shall also (x) recognize as service for benefit accrual purposes all service rendered by U.S. Hourly Transitioned Employees prior to the Effective Benefits Time which is recognized as Credited Service (as defined in the Hourly Pension Plans, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Benefits Time) under the terms of the Hourly Pension Plans and (y) provide for an offset in calculating benefits payable under Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans of the normal retirement benefit payable as a single life annuity, if any, by the Hourly Pension Plans with respect to service recognized under the Hourly Pension Plans covering the same period of service but in no event shall the amount of such offset be greater than the amount of the benefit calculated under Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans with respect to service prior to the Effective Benefits Time.   (iii) ITT and Purchaser agree to cooperate in mutually providing information to the other party hereto regarding participants in the Hourly Pension Plans and Purchaser\'s Hourly Pension Plans as necessary or appropriate for the calculation and determination of benefits and commencement of payments under each such plan.

(m) WARN Act. The parties hereto agree that for purposes of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, (the "WARN Act"), the date immediately following the Closing Date shall be the "Effective Date of the Sale" as such term is used in the WARN Act.

The Sellers are further in the process of setting up such a new, unrelated trust (the "FHS Germany Pension Trust") to receive such assets in accordance with applicable law. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement the Sellers shall be entitled to implement the change of the ITT CTA, the set up of FHS Germany Pension Trust for the deferred compensation plan of the German Partnerships and the transfer of the assets allocated to the German Partnerships\' employees to FHS Germany Pension Trust. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to establish the FHS Germany Pension Trust and to transfer the assets allocated to the German Partnerships\' Employees before Closing and thereupon to cause the applicable Entity Seller to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver the FHS Germany Pension Trust to the applicable Designated Entity Purchaser, it being understood by Purchaser that the completion of such transfer is subject to approval by a third-party governmental entity, which approval, despite such reasonable best efforts of the Sellers, may not be provided until after the Closing Date.

Further, Buyer shall instruct the managements of the German Partnerships and FHS Management GmbH to, and procure that the German Partnerships and FHS Management GmbH shall, neither revoke nor alter such notification to ITT Pension Trust e.V. (irrespective of whether it has been given prior to or after Closing) in a way not complying with the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence.   (s) Beneficiaries and Dependents. Any reference in this Section 6.6 to employees and former employees of the FHS Company or of any Asset Seller with respect to the Business shall include, as appropriate or as required by the context, any beneficiaries or dependents of such employees and former employees receiving or who may in the future become entitled to receive any benefits by virtue of such employees\' or former employees\' employment or former employment with the FHS Companies or any Asset Seller, including, without limitation, any such beneficiaries or dependents who are survivors of any former employee who is deceased as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.   (t) No Third Party Rights. No provision of this Section 6.6 shall create nor is intended to create nor shall be construed to confer:   (i) any third party beneficiary rights in any individual, including any employee or former employee, or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, of the FHS Companies       47   or any Asset Seller or Purchaser in respect of continued employment or resumed employment or in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plans, program, policy, practices or arrangement of ITT or Purchaser whether prior to, on, or after the Closing Date; or   (ii) any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities, legal or equitable, on any person, firm, corporation, organization or other entity other than ITT, Purchaser, any FHS Company or any other entity or individual (or their respective successors and assigns).

ITT shall be responsible for all liabilities with respect to any workers\' compensation claims made by any Employee to the extent related to an injury, occupational illness and/or exposure occurring prior to the Closing Date, and, in connection with the foregoing, Purchaser hereby agrees to cooperate with ITT as ITT may reasonably request, in providing access to employment and benefits records Purchaser may acquire in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to ensure proper payment of such claims, as well as providing, where reasonably available, accommodations for any such employees to return to work on a restricted basis.   (v) Pension Plans and Arrangements.

(c) (i) The representations and warranties of ITT contained in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of this Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties of ITT contained in Sections 4.12(f), 4.12(g), 4.12(k) and 4.12(o) of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations in respect of such tax matters, (iii) the representations and warranties of ITT contained in Section 4.12 (except for the representations and warranties in Sections 4.12(f), 4.12(g), 4.12(k) and 4.12(o)) and Section 4.16 shall not survive the Closing and (iv) all other representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date. Any claim for indemnification under Sections 9.1(a)(vi), 9.1(a)(vii) and 9.1(a)(viii) must be asserted before the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, after which no claims may be asserted under Sections 9.1(a)(vi), 9.1(a)(vii) and 9.1(a)(viii).   (d) ITT shall not be obligated to make any indemnification payment under Section 9.1(a)(vi) unless and until such time as the aggregate Purchaser Losses incurred by Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of any single or aggregated Warranty Claims arising out of the same or series of related facts, events or circumstances exceeds $500,000 (the "Warranty Deductible"), and then any indemnification with respect to Purchaser Losses shall be made with respect to 50% of all Purchaser Losses incurred as a result of such single or aggregated Warranty Claims arising out of the same or series of related facts, events or circumstances in excess of the Warranty Deductible.   (e) (i) ITT shall not be obligated to make any indemnification payment under Section 9.1(a)(vii) unless and until such time as the aggregate Purchaser Losses incurred by Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a result of any such Recall exceeds $500,000 (the "Recall Deductible"), and then any indemnification with respect to Purchaser Losses shall be made with respect to 80% of all Purchaser Losses incurred as a result of such Recall in excess of the Recall Deductible.   (ii) In connection with any Recall that exceeds the Recall Deductible, ITT shall be entitled to participate (to the extent that Purchaser has the right to participate) in the discussions, negotiations and proceedings conducted in connection with such Recall. Purchaser shall permit ITT to investigate such Recall, including, (A) to discuss the Recall with such officers, employees, consultants and representatives of the Business as ITT reasonably requests, (B) to have reasonable access to the properties, books, records, papers, documents, plans and drawings of the Business at reasonable hours to review information and documentation relative to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and other records of the Business, and (C) to conduct such investigations and studies as are reasonably necessary in connection with such investigation within reasonable parameters approved by Purchaser (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld); provided that any such investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice, shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel and operations of the Business and shall be at ITT\'s sole expense. All requests for access to the offices, properties, books and records of Purchaser and the Business shall be made to such representatives of Purchaser as Purchaser shall       65   designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access permitted hereunder. It is further agreed that neither ITT nor its representatives shall contact any of the employees, customers, suppliers, or other Subsidiaries or Affiliates of the Business in connection with any Recall, whether in person or by telephone, mail or other means of communication, without the specific prior authorization of such representatives of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Neither party shall enter into any agreement or settlement, or consent to the entry of any judgment, in connection with any Recall without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances (including the Purchaser Losses involved and the effect of such agreement, settlement, consent or judgment on the Business and the relationship between Purchaser and its Affiliates and their customers). ITT shall not be obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any settlement relating to a Recall entered into by or with the consent of Purchaser if such settlement was entered into without ITT\'s prior written consent.   (iii) Promptly after the receipt by any Purchaser Indemnified Party of any inquiry from NHTSA or any other Governmental Authority with respect to any product sold prior to Closing by an FHS Company or Asset Seller in respect of the Business, whether such inquiry comes directly from such Governmental Authority or is forwarded by any customer, such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall give written notice thereof to ITT, stating the nature and basis of the inquiry and the relevant details thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the inquiry, and such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall continue to provide ITT with copies of any ongoing correspondence with respect to such inquiry. Failure of any Purchaser Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve ITT from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that ITT is actually prejudiced thereby.   (f) Claims for Purchaser Losses or ITT Losses caused by or arising out of misrepresentation or breach of warranty or breach of covenant or agreement may be made only pursuant to Article IX hereof. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to this Article IX shall terminate when the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to Section 9.2(c); provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice to the indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Any person seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall give notice of any claim for indemnification under this Agreement promptly after such person determines the claim could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement. The notice shall comply with Section 9.3 in the case of a third-party claim.   (g) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX for lost profits or consequential or punitive damages, except to the extent necessary to       66   reimburse an Indemnified Party for judgments actually awarded to third parties in respect of such types of damages.   (h) No indemnification claim under this Agreement may be asserted or pursued against any Seller by any FHS Company or any entity that is a Subsidiary as of the Closing Date if such FHS Company or entity shall cease to be controlled by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than the FHS Companies) (a "Sold Entity"); provided, however, that the foregoing clause shall in no way limit Purchaser\'s right to indemnification under this Agreement, including for Purchaser Losses resulting from claims by any Sold Entity or its Affiliates, successors or assigns, against Purchaser.   9.3. Procedures for Claims.  ----------------------   (a) Third-Party Claims. Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of a notice of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by any third party that may be subject to indemnification hereunder, including for purposes of this Section 9.3 any Tax Claim (as defined below) with respect to which notice must be provided within five Business Days following receipt thereof, such Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party, stating in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing the claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the third party claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice, but not if such claim imposes criminal liability. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the third party claim in accordance herewith and notified the Indemnified Party in writing thereof, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the third party claim, it being understood the Indemnifying Party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party for all periods after the Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party of such claim and prior to such time as the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party that it has assumed the defense of such third party claim (it is agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay reasonable costs and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties), (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld) and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from claims by third parties and shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties shall also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. If the Indemnifying Party shall not have assumed the defense, such       67   party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (b) Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any payment made pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be decreased by any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss. To the extent an insurance recovery is made after receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder, the recipient of the recovery shall refund the Indemnifying Party the amount of such recovery. If the amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement (an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit (as defined below) to the party making the claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit actually realized in the year of Loss by the party making the claim. For purposes of this Section 9.3(b), a "Tax Benefit" means an amount by which the tax liability of the party (or group of corporations including the party) is reduced (including, without limitation, by deduction, reduction of income by virtue of increased tax basis or otherwise, entitlement to refund, credit or otherwise) plus any related interest received from the relevant taxing authority. Where a party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it ("Other Tax Items"), the determination of any Tax Benefit shall be calculated by utilizing the Tax Benefits arising from an Indemnity Claim after any Other Tax Items. In the event that there should be a determination disallowing the Tax Benefit, the indemnifying party shall be liable to refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any related reduction previously allowed or payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(b).   (c) Environmental Claims. In addition to any other limitations that may apply, with respect to any claim for indemnification that Purchaser may assert with respect to Section 9.1(a)(viii):   (i) Prior to Purchaser incurring or authorizing any costs or expenses with respect to such claim for which indemnity may be sought, Purchaser shall notify ITT of such claim and afford ITT reasonable opportunity to evaluate the conditions giving rise to such claim. ITT shall not be responsible under this indemnity for any costs incurred prior to the delivery of such notice, unless such advance notice is impractical due to an imminent and serious risk (A) to human health or safety, or (B) of significant losses, damages or violations of law, in which case Purchaser shall notify ITT as soon as reasonably practicable. If requested in writing by ITT after such notification, Purchaser shall allow ITT to undertake any investigation, remediation, or other action required or permitted by applicable Environmental Laws, and any other action ITT may reasonably propose subject to the provisions of Section 9.3(c)(ii), Section 9.3(c)(iv); provided that such investigation, remediation or other action does not unreasonably interfere with the use of any Real Property as of the date hereof or other reasonable use of such Real Property as an industrial or manufacturing facility. In any event, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, ITT shall have no obligation under this Agreement to undertake, or to indemnify Purchaser for undertaking or causing to be undertaken, any measure: (X) to remediate conditions of soil, groundwater, or any other environmental medium at, on,       68   from or under any Real Property to a standard more stringent than is necessary to satisfy, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, (I) the controlling Governmental Authority (it being understood that such standard is acceptable to such Governmental Authority, or accepted by such Governmental Authority after negotiations with or proceedings involving ITT), or (II) where no Governmental Authority is involved, the applicable Environmental Laws (including site specific standards using risk-based methodologies, where available); or (Y) arising out of a change in or addition to any Environmental Laws after the Closing Date.    (ii) ITT shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of material plans, actions, investigations and appointments with regulatory and enforcement authorities such that Purchaser is in a position to request additional information if Purchaser reasonably believes that it needs such information as the owner or operator of the Real Property. ITT shall be entitled to control all negotiations and communications with regulatory and enforcement authorities and any other claimant or affected entity with respect to such claim, provided that, insofar as such claim for indemnification concerns conditions at or affecting any Real Property, or may otherwise reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Purchaser or the Business (A) Purchaser may, at its expense, monitor any proceeding with counsel of its choice without any right of control thereof, and (B) if reasonably requested by Purchaser, ITT shall consult with Purchaser regarding the defense and resolution thereof, allowing Purchaser reasonable participation therein. "Reasonable participation" shall include, by way of illustration and not limitation, that ITT shall (AA) give Purchaser reasonable advance notice before proposing in writing, agreeing to or undertaking any investigation, remediation or other action required or permitted by applicable Environmental Laws, on or significantly affecting any Real Property, that could significantly affect such Real Property or operations thereon, (BB) consult with Purchaser regarding any such investigation, remediation or other action and reasonably consider any comments of Purchaser with respect thereto, and (CC) if Purchaser reasonably requests, provide Purchaser with such material plans, reports, pleadings and other documents to be submitted to Governmental Authority or claimant concerning such investigation, remediation or other action, in draft form to Purchaser, taking reasonable efforts to provide them within a reasonable time prior to delivering such documents to a Governmental Authority or claimant and reasonably consider any comments from Purchaser with respect thereto. ITT shall give Purchaser reasonable advance notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, any significant in-person meetings or conference calls with any Governmental Authority concerning such claims; provided that such participation shall be subject to, and shall not be used to compromise, ITT\'s right to control all negotiations and communications with regulatory and enforcement authorities and any other claimant or affected entity with respect to such claim. ITT will obtain Purchaser\'s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, prior to settling any such claim that is brought by any third party, including any Governmental Authority, the resolution of which would affect any Real Property or Purchaser\'s operations.    (iii) If ITT does not assume the defense, remediation and/or resolution of any such claim within fourteen (14) days after being notified of such claim as provided in (i) above, then Purchaser may defend and/or resolve such claim, affording ITT the same procedures       69   to which Purchaser is entitled under this Agreement when ITT is handling such claims, and subject to the same limitations on such claims set forth in this Agreement.   (iv) ITT and Purchaser shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pre-trial activities, trial, compromise, settlement, discharge or remediation arising in connection with any claim in respect of which indemnity is sought in order to facilitate the expeditious and cost-effective resolution of any such claim, including, but not limited to, by: (1) providing the other party with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as witnesses), other relevant information, and facilities, provided, that in each case, such access shall be given at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice and without undue interruption to such party\'s business or personnel; (2) executing consents and other forms; (3) recording deed restrictions, provided that they do not significantly limit or restrict the use of the Real Property insofar as the nature and extent of such use is consistent with that of such Real Property as of the date hereof, or with other reasonable use as an industrial or manufacturing facility; and (4) undertaking such other measures as may reasonably be requested by ITT, including engineering or institutional controls, in the case that ITT is carrying out its activities under Section 9.3(c), or as may reasonably be requested by Purchaser; and (5) causing any of its Affiliates to so provide, execute, record or undertake.   (v) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause any of its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in effectuating any assignment to ITT of any rights to recovery on such claim as any of them may have against any other person, and in ITT realizing such rights.   (vi) In the event that Purchaser has asserted a claim for indemnification with respect to Section 9.1(a)(viii) concerning any Real Property, and in any case with respect to the Owned Real Property located at New Lexington, Ohio (the "New Lexington Property"), Purchaser acknowledges, warrants and agrees that any contract, deed, transfer document or other instrument for transfer of any interest in, possession of, or right to use the whole or any part of such Real Property acquired as a result of this Agreement, shall require as a condition of any such transfer that the transferee shall be bound by, and shall assume all the terms, covenants and conditions of, this Section 9.3(c) with respect to the proposed transfer; provided, however, that with respect to any parcel of Real Property other than the New Lexington Property, Purchaser is not required to impose such condition so long as (x) (A) ITT is under no actual or reasonably foreseeable obligation pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law to notify any Governmental Authority concerning such claim, or to investigate or remediate with respect to such Claim, and (B) there is no third-party claim pending or threatened against Purchaser or ITT relating to such claim, and (y) Purchaser withdraws and agrees not to assert such claim for indemnification.   (vii) To the extent that either ITT or Purchaser has been successful on the merits or otherwise in any action, suit or proceeding, including the defense thereof, regarding a dispute between such parties concerning their rights or obligations under Section 9.1(a)(viii), the non-successful party shall indemnify the successful party for any expenses (including attorneys\' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the successful party in connection therewith.       70    (viii) Immediately following the Closing, Purchaser and ITT shall cause ERM, a nationally recognized environmental consultant, to complete environmental assessments that update the data to the extent mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and ITT (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in existing Phase II environmental site assessment reports on the Real Property identified on Schedule 9.3(c) (the "Baseline Environmental Assessments"), to help determine the presence and levels of Materials of Environmental Concern in the soil, groundwater, or any other relevant environmental media as of the Closing Date. The Baseline Environmental Assessments may be used as evidence of the presence of Materials of Environmental Concern on the Real Property, but shall not be conclusive. The costs of the Baseline Environmental Assessments will be shared equally by ITT and Purchaser.   9.4. Tax Indemnification.  --------------------   (a) Indemnification for Taxes. ITT agrees to indemnify Purchaser from and against all Taxes, and all other Losses relating to the payment of any Taxes of the FHS Companies with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Period") (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") to the extent allocable (determined in accordance with the following sentence) to the portion of such Straddle Period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date) (other than Taxes accrued on the most recent balance sheet of the Business or, if applicable, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement). Any allocation required to determine Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the Books and Records of the FHS Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date and, to the extent not susceptible to such allocation, by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days. ITT agrees to indemnify Purchaser from and against all Taxes, and all other Losses relating to the payment of any Taxes, required to be paid due to a failure by ITT Canada to comply with any provincial or local Tax laws relating to asset transfers that, absent compliance therewith (whether the compliance is mandatory or not), subject the Canada Asset Purchaser to liability for any Tax of ITT Canada and/or imposes a lien on the Purchased Assets.   (b) Audit Adjustment. If as a result of any audit adjustment for any Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser or any of the FHS Companies realize a Tax Benefit (other than interest and penalties thereon) for any period ending on or after the Closing Date to which they would not otherwise have been entitled, and such audit adjustment relates solely to a timing difference within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standard Board 109, Purchaser shall pay ITT the amount of such Tax Benefit; provided, however, that (i) ITT shall give Purchaser written notice of any such audit adjustment within 60 days after the date the adjustment is made; (ii) Purchaser shall pay ITT the amount of the Tax Benefit within five Business Days after the date Purchaser or the FHS Companies realizes such Tax Benefit; and (iii) ITT shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the FHS Companies from and against all Taxes attributable to a future reduction in such Tax Benefit.      71    (c) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.3, this Section 9.4(c) shall apply to all claims, audits, examinations and other proposed changes or adjustments by any taxing authority concerning any Taxes for which ITT is or may be liable, in whole or in part, pursuant to this Agreement (each a "Tax Claim"). With respect to any Tax Claim, ITT shall, at its own expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that ITT shall not consent to any settlement, compromise or resolution of such Tax Claim without the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if such resolution affects the computation of any item of income, expense, deduction, taxable income, credit or Tax Liability for any period ending after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to cooperate with ITT in pursuing such Tax Claim. ITT shall use reasonable efforts to keep Purchaser informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim and Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to observe (but not to control) the conduct of any Tax Claim.   9.5. Certain Claims Procedures. The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party promptly of its discovery of any matter giving rise to a claim of indemnity pursuant hereto. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters.   9.6. Arbitration.  ------------   (a) Subject to Section 9.6(b), any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration shall be conducted by a sole arbitrator in New York, New York and in the English language. The award shall not include punitive damages. Judgment upon the award (for purposes of enforcement) may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the parties or their assets.   (b) The provisions of Section 9.6(a) shall not apply with respect to controversies or claims arising out of the provisions of Section 3.3.   9.7. Remedies Exclusive. After the Closing Date, this Article IX shall constitute the exclusive remedy available and in lieu of any other remedies that may be available to any party under or pursuant to any statutory or common law with respect to any Losses of any kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of the matters set forth in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder.      72    9.8. Mitigation. Purchaser and ITT shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.   ARTICLE X   TERMINATION  -----------   10.1. Termination Events. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned:   (a) by mutual consent of the parties hereto;   (b) by any party by notice to the other party if the Closing  shall not have been consummated by the date which is one year following  the date of this Agreement, unless extended by written agreement of the  parties hereto; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement  under this clause (b) shall not be available to any party whose failure  to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of,  or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such  date; or   (c) by either party, if any Governmental Authority shall have  issued a final order, decree or ruling enjoining or otherwise  prohibiting any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (unless such order, decree or ruling has been withdrawn, reversed or  otherwise made inapplicable) if the failure to consummate such  prohibited transaction could not be remedied such that there would be  no Business Material Adverse Effect; provided, that the right to  terminate this Agreement under this clause (c) shall not be available  to any party who shall not have complied with the obligations under  Section 6.3.   10.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of the Agreement as provided in Section 10.1 above, this Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Purchaser or ITT, except that (a) the obligations of Purchaser and ITT under Sections 6.2(b) (including the survival of the Confidentiality Agreement) and 6.4 and Article XI of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) such termination shall not relieve either party of any liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

This policy is used in conjunction with ITT\'s Financial Policy 50-06. The controller of the Business reviews sales prices and variable cost data for all parts sold by the FHS Companies. If any part is being sold at a price that is below its variable cost, the controller of the Business undertakes a further analysis that compares the total sales price of all parts sold on the customer platform with the total variable cost of the parts on that same platform.  For example, if the Business bids for and obtains business for a particular platform for strategic reasons that it expects will be close to break-even on a variable margin basis, the contract is monitored regularly to determine whether the overall platform will break even for the remainder of the contract (taking into account any known future variations in either selling price or costs). If the platform will not break even, a loss accrual is booked for that particular platform, for the remaining life of the contract.  For individual parts not associated with a specific platform, if losses are incurred at the variable level, a similar analysis is undertaken. This analysis considers whether sales are material in relation to the total sales to the specific customer. If an accrual is appropriate, it is calculated for the remainder of the contract in the same manner as described in the preceding paragraph.  Because the FHS Companies are managed and marketed on a value center basis, the above policy of accruing for losses results in a fair representation of the economic realities of the Business and thus is in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   WARRANTY AND RETROFIT PROCEDURE Warranty and retrofit charges arise after the passing of title or customer acceptance. Warranty covers costs for replacements, returns and allowances, repairs, etc. of defective material shipped to customers when such costs are required by contractual clause. Retrofit includes costs for returns and replacements and product modification for defective product shipped to customers when such costs are required by contractual clause or by implied company policy, and the expenses are due to errors in manufacture or design.  Reserves for warranty are established based on previous experience and/or specifically identified quality issues. Due to the nature of the product, extensive quality testing requirements, Just-In-Time delivery and immediate installation of the product by the customer, defects are generally identified within a few days of shipment to the customer. The controller makes a detailed review at the end of each accounting period to evaluate the adequacy of the reserve amounts. This Policy is used in conjunction with ITT\'s Financial Policy 50-06.    8  ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS  It is ITT\'s policy to actively monitor and document environmental costs related to soil and ground water remediation. ITT systematically collects and documents such costs and uses the data for accrual verification purposes.  Environmental costs are generally charged as an expense. For example, equipment purchased specifically for remediation that lacks ongoing value to the entity beyond the remediation project is expensed. ITT capitalizes environmental costs only if they are recoverable and meet AT LEAST one of the following criteria:   o The costs extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety  or efficiency of property owned by ITT, and the condition of the  property is improved, as compared with the condition of the property  when it was originally constructed or acquired.   o The costs mitigate, or prevent environmental contamination that will  potentially occur under the current conditions or might otherwise  result from future operations or activities, and the property is  improved compared with the condition of the property when it was  originally constructed or acquired.   o The costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale.  ITT accounts for environmental costs in accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", AICPA Statement of Position 96-1, "Environmental Remediation Liabilities," and FASB Interpretation No. 14, "Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss."   Accruing Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued by a charge to income when an expense or loss is probable (i.e., likely to occur) and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The controller utilizes the Environmental Exposures Report as the basis for evaluating and revising accruals. The accrual is based on the "best estimate" of the future cost. Only if there is no sound basis for developing a best estimate, ITT will use a range of possible exposures. In such cases, the accrual is made for the low end of the selected range if that is considered a reasonable estimate (i.e., a surrogate best estimate) of the loss. ITT\'s controller evaluates the range of exposures used and the accrual amount selected to ensure they both reflect a reasonably accurate estimate of future cost.  ITT has elected not to discount its environmental liabilities.   Third-Party Recoveries ITT obtains assessments of the probability of anticipated recoveries from third parties (e.g., insurance companies, former owners), independent of its own internal cost estimate. ITT will only report an anticipated recovery if it is deemed probable (i.e., likely to occur). ITT does not reduce a liability with a recovery.  Probable recoveries included in the ITT Industries Environmental Cost Estimating Model Worksheets are recorded separately as an asset. ITT\'s individual units only record probable third-party recoveries that are not otherwise included in ITT Headquarters\' overall insurance recovery litigation process.    9   Remediation Costs Included in the Accrual The accrual for a site\'s environmental remediation and investigation costs encompass the associated costs. At sites where the environmental liabilities are shared with another party or parties, the accrual includes an estimate for the additional costs that ITT expects to bear, if other involved parties fail to contribute their share.  Remediation costs are estimated using the ITT Industries Environmental Cost Estimating Model Worksheet, which considers the primary cost elements in the remediation process, the effects of current laws and regulations, liability sharing and the state of technology. Cost elements considered include, but are not limited to:   o The cost of the remediation investigation and feasibility studies;   o Construction, design, and pilot study costs;   o Outside legal, consulting, and remediation project management fees;   o Incremental in-house costs (e.g., additional labor);   o Projected costs of remediation activities, including permitting, waste  disposal, sampling, and analysis costs;   o Site closure and mandated post-remediation monitoring costs; and   o Equipment or materials purchased for remediation which lacks value upon  project completion.  RESERVES FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION LIABILITIES  The cost of workers compensation liabilities for the Business locations in Europe, Canada and Mexico are covered by government sponsored programs.  The cost of workers compensation liabilities for the Ohio locations is self-insured, in compliance with Ohio state law. For the other domestic locations, workers compensation benefits are insured with licensed carriers, subject to a deductible. In all states, workers compensation claims are handled by qualified third-party administrators who establish claim reserves. Reserves are reviewed as necessary and at least annually to ensure they are adequate.    10   SCHEDULE 4.2   CORPORATE AUTHORITY (SECTION 4.2): None    11    SCHEDULE 4.3(A)   FHS COMPANY STOCK (SECTION 4.3): None    12    SCHEDULE 4.3(B)   FHS COMPANY STOCK (SECTION 4.3):  INFORMATION ON SHARES AND PARTNERSHIP INTEREST  ITT Automotive, Inc.  o The authorized capital stock is 100 shares, and 100 shares of capital  stock are outstanding, issued to and owned by ITT Industries, Inc.

KG" in the amount of DM 300,000 each that are now held by either ITT Automotive Europe GmbH and Co. KG or ITT Fluid Handling    20   Systems GmbH and Co. KG. The certificates evidencing the charges (Grundschuldbriefe) have been lost.   HOCKENHEIM, GERMANY Attached    21   SCHEDULE 4.7(B)(VII)   FRENCH REAL PROPERTY (SECTION 4.7(B)(VII)):  FRENCH REAL ESTATE  (1) ITT Automotive Europe GmbH and Co. KG ("ITTAE") owns two plots of land registered under cadastral sections referred to as 25n(degree) 486/360 and 27n(degree) 173/148, located on the territory of the commune of Creutzwald (France).  ITTAE acquired these plots of land from SEBL (Societe d\'Equipement du Bassin Lorrain).  The plots of land were acquired to allow for the extension of the existing factory owned by ITTAE in Creutzwald, and they are included within an urban development area (Zone d\'amenagement concerte - ZAC) called "Parc d\'activites de Creutzwald Sud."  SEBL, as former owner, was in charge of the development of the ZAC under a concession agreement entered into with the City of Creutzwald.  Within the ZAC, a set of regulations (cahier des charges de cession de terrain) strictly regulates the assignment of plots of land. These regulations determine the rights and obligations of all successive purchasers of plots of land within the ZAC.  In connection with any sale of any plot of land within the ZAC, the regulations require the purchaser of such plot of land to commit as follows:   - Within one year after acquiring the property, such purchaser must  request a permit to build a structure on the property, which such  purchaser must file with the local authority (Mairie de Creutzwald);  and   - Such purchaser must carry out and complete the construction within two  years following delivery of the building permit.  ITTAE obtained a permit to build an extension to the Creutzwald factory, but later decided not to build the extension and has not complied with its commitment to complete construction within the two-year timeframe.  When such noncompliance occurs, the ZAC regulations allow a purchaser\'s acquisition of the land to be cancelled and for SEBL to redeem the land at a value fixed in advance by the regulations. In this case, the redemption value is 70% of the purchase price.  ITTAE and the City of Creutzwald (as successor of SEBL) have started negotiations to extend the time allowed for ITTAE to complete the construction, from 2006 to 2010, with the option to renegotiate the deadline again in 2010. The Mayor of Creutzwald has verbally consented to such an extension; however, the City Council must also approve the extension before the extension is final and binding. The Council has represented that it will address the extension at the end of November.    22   (2) Mandatory conditions precedent to the sale of the French Real Property:   (i) With respect to the un-built plots of land, the sale of the French  real estate is subject to the prior consent of the SEBL. Notice of  the sale must be given three months in advance. [Prior consent from  SEBL is limited to the un-built plot of land and does not apply to  the French Real Estate]   (ii) The sale of the French Real Estate (either built or un-built plots  of land) is subject to City of Creutzwald\'s right of pre-emption,  which allows the city to purchase the property at the price stated on  the notice of sale. The City may waive this right expressly or  implicitly, if at the end of a two-month period, the city has not  responded.   LAND REGISTER The Land Register still refers to the owner as being: "ITT Automotive GmbH sarl of German law registered under the number HR B 8711 at the register of Frankfurt am Main and having its registered office 7 Guerickstrasse in Frankfurt am Main." The same identification was used in the deed of sale of December 11, 2001.  ITTAE has taken action to have this corrected or clarified with the Land Registry to reflect that ITTAE is the actual owner and may validly sell the land to the Designated Asset Purchaser.  The Land Register indicates that the court of first instance (TGI) of Metz created on September 3, 2002, a mortgage (until December 2, 2012) in guarantee of the reimbursement of a debt of (euro)66,494 (principal) plus (euro)4,103 (interest) to the benefit of a Bank (Caisse Regionale du Credit Agricole Mutuel Pyrenees Gascogne de Tarbes). The relevant amounts have been paid and the mortgage has been released. The notary of ITTAE\'s French branch has taken action to have the mortgage stricken from the register.    23   SCHEDULE 4.8   CONTRACTS (SECTION 4.8): None    24   SCHEDULE 4.9   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (SECTION 4.9):  Kimberly A.Tene v.

Honeywell International\'s infringement claim was  dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Michigan. An appeal of the dismissal is pending in the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Federal Circuit.   o ITW Offer to License. ITTA and ITW-Deltar, an Illinois Tool Works  subsidiary, (ITW) were recently among rival bidders for a contract to  supply Daimler Chrysler ("DCX") with a fuel system assembly that  included fuel lines and clips to hold the fuel lines in place relative  to the automobile chassis. After ITTA won the business, a series of  e-mail exchanges began between an ITTA purchasing specialist and an ITW  sales manager, in which it originally appeared that ITW wished to sell  the clips originally called for in the DCX assembly contract bid  documentation (the "DCX Clip Design") to ITTA for use in the contracted  assembly. When ITTA indicated that it would be producing its own clips,  ITW asked to see design data for those clips to determine whether they  would infringe ITW\'s clip patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,393,185 (the "\'185  patent"). ITTA refused to    28   provide the design data. Apparently assuming that ITTA would therefore  use the DCX Clip Design, and apparently believing that the DCX Clip  Design would infringe the \'185 patent, the ITW sales manager indicated  by e-mail on October 18, 2005, that ITW would offer ITTA a license upon  confirmation of the use of the DCX Clip Design. On October 31, 2005,  the ITW sales manager provided the ITTA purchasing specialist a copy of  a proposed license agreement.   Following review by patent counsel for ITTA, ITTA decided not to use  the DCX Clip Design to fulfill the assembly contract and DCX has  accepted an alternative clip design that ITTA believes does not  infringe the \'185 patent. There has been no communication with ITW  regarding this matter since the e-mail of October 31, 2005, referenced  above.  4.10(C)(III): None    29   SCHEDULE 4.11   INSURANCE (SECTION 4.11): None    30    SCHEDULE 4.12   WAIVERS (4.12(C)):  FEDERAL: Waivers of the statute of limitations have been executed on behalf of the consolidated federal group, ITT Industries, Inc. and Affiliated Companies, which includes ITT Automotive, Inc.

In the case of non-union employees, notice and severance cannot be less than that provided under the Employment Standards Act of Ontario. However, the courts have determined that since they do not have representation by a union or other body, notice and severance should be based upon historical jurisprudence. Thus, ITT Industries of Canada LP\'s policy is as follows:   o clerical /non-supervisory employees, 2 weeks\' notice, plus 2 weeks\'  severance per year of service, plus a further 2 weeks\' severance if  aged 50 or older.   o Supervisory/management employees (not general or plant manager), 3  weeks\' notice, plus 3 weeks\' severance per year of service, plus 3  weeks\' severance if aged 50 or older.   o Executive employees (including plant and general managers), 4 weeks\'  notice plus 4 weeks\' severance per year of service, plus 4 weeks\'  severance if aged 50 or older.  In a few unusual cases the courts have awarded more than 24 months\' severance but normally, payments would be capped at 24 months. ITT Industries of Canada LP has never paid a severance in excess of 24 months (including notice).    67    SCHEDULE 6.12(E)   FRENCH TAX MATTERS (SECTION 6.12(E)):  Purchaser agrees that it will cause the French operations of ITTAE that it acquires to prepare and either submit to ITTAE for filing or will consult with ITTAE and file on ITTAE\'s behalf (the "Closing Tax Filings"):   1. a French liquidation tax return, within 45 days after the Closing Date;   2. a report of wages paid between January 1st and the closing date of the  French branch, within 45 days after the Closing Date;   3. French employment tax returns covering the period from the last such  employment tax returns to the Closing Date, within 45 days after the  Closing Date; and   4. a French VAT return covering the period from the last French VAT return  to the Closing Date and a declaration of the cession, within 25 days  after the Closing Date.   Seller agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that Purchaser will prepare and file on ITTAE\'s behalf the Closing Tax Filings, ITTAE will remain solely responsible for the Closing Tax Filings and the Taxes due in respect thereof and Purchaser will have no liability whatsoever in relation therewith and will be held harmless from any consequences thereof, including any consequences resulting from the fact that the Closing Tax Filings would be untrue, incomplete or inexact or lately filed as a result of ITTAE\'s failure to timely approve the Closing Tax Filings prepared by Purchaser.   Purchaser agrees to reimburse ITTAE for the French business and real estate Taxes paid for the tax year from the Closing Date to the end of the tax year, and such reimbursement shall be made by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days. If the French tax authorities request from Purchaser the payment of such Taxes paid for the tax year from the beginning of the tax year to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser the amount of such taxes and such reimbursement shall be made by apportionment on the basis of elapsed days.  In respect of French VAT and to benefit from the VAT exemption on the sale of the French branch assets, Purchaser undertakes to subject to tax the future cessions of the investments goods received from the FHS Companies and to regularize, if necessary, the VAT which would have been due if the FHS Companies had continued using the goods.    68    SCHEDULE 6.13(I)   TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS (SECTION 6.13): Attached    69    SCHEDULE 6.13(II)   TRANSITION ARRANGEMENTS (SECTION 6.13): Attached    70    SCHEDULE 6.17   REAL PROPERTY (SECTION 6.17):  OWNED REAL PROPERTY TO BE TRANSFERRED The Owned Real Property located at 701 E.
