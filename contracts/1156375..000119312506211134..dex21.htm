Option shall be equal to the number of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common
Stock subject to each such CBOT Holdings Stock Option multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of CME Holdings Class
A Common Stock, and such CME Holdings Stock Option shall have an exercise

to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time (after
taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if

subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease, at the
Effective Time, to represent an Equity Right with respect to shares of CBOT
Holdings Class A Common Stock and shall be converted without any action on
the part of any holder of an Equity Right, at the Effective Time, into an
Equity Right consisting of, based on or relating to shares of CME Holdings
Class A Common Stock granted under a CME Holdings Stock Plan, other than CME
Holdings Stock Options (each, a " _CME Holdings Stock-Based Award_ "), on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the CBOT Holdings Stock-
Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto, including any
acceleration or vesting thereof, provided for in the relevant CBOT Holdings
Stock Plan or in the related award document (including any employment
agreement and the retention policy set forth in  _Section 5.1(h)_ of the
CBOT Holdings Disclosure Letter) by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby). The number of shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock subject to
each such CME Holdings Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of
shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock subject to the CBOT Holdings
Stock-Based Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the

applicable, such CME Holdings Stock-Based Award shall have an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to the per share exercise
price specified in the CBOT Holdings Stock-Based Award divided by the Exchange
Ratio. Any dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder of a
CBOT Holdings Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited
to such holders account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to

Awards have been assumed by CME Holdings and shall continue in effect on the

relevant CBOT Holdings Stock Plans).

(d) Following the Effective Time, CME Holdings may maintain the CBOT Holdings
Stock Plans for purposes of granting future awards in accordance with NYSE
and Nasdaq rules. If any CBOT Holdings Stock Plans are so maintained, the
provisions of such CBOT Holdings Stock Plans, including the respective terms
of such plans, shall not be changed by the Surviving Entity, except that (i)
all Equity Rights issued by CME Holdings pursuant to the CBOT



 

19 Holdings Stock Plans following the Effective Time shall be Equity Rights in
respect of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock, (ii) all references to CBOT
Holdings (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of CBOT
Holdings) in each CBOT Holdings Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing
any award thereunder shall be deemed to refer to CME Holdings, unless CME
Holdings determines otherwise and (iii) the number of shares of CME Holdings

appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of CME Holdings Class A Common
Stock subject to such CME Holdings Stock Options and CME Holdings Stock-Based
Awards (and the Available CBOT Holdings Stock Plan Shares, as the case

or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such CME Holdings Stock
Options and CME Holdings Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Mailing Date, CME Holdings shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to CBOT Holdings (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates representing shares of CBOT Holdings Class
A Common Stock and non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter, the



 

20 Surviving Entity will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of record of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock as of the
Effective Time (other than any holder which has previously and properly
surrendered all of its Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with
_Section 1.10_ ), a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) in such form as CBOT Holdings and CME Holdings may reasonably
agree, for use in effecting delivery of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent. As promptly as practicable after the
Election Date (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Election Date), the Exchange Agent shall determine the Actual Cash Amount and
the allocation of Merger Consideration and shall notify CME Holdings of such
determination (the date of such determination, the " _Determination Date_ ").
At the Effective Time, CME Holdings shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i)
the number of shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock (including
fractional shares) to be delivered as Stock Consideration in respect of the No
Election Shares and the shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock for
which an election to receive stock consideration is properly made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, (ii) the number of shares of
CME Holdings Class A Common Stock (including fractional shares) as shall be
necessary to deliver the Stock Consideration in respect of the shares of CBOT
Holdings Class A Common Stock for which an election to receive the Stock
Consideration is properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to this
_Section 2.1_, and (iii) the Available Cash Amount. CME Holdings shall also
make sufficient funds available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
needed to pay cash in respect of dividends or other distributions
contemplated by _Section 2.1(f)_. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be
effected in accordance with CME Holdings customary procedures with respect to
securities represented by book entry.

(b) Each holder of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, will be entitled to receive (A) one or more certificates of
CME Holdings Class A Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the number of shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.9_ and (B)
a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration,
if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.9_
and this _Article II_ , including dividends and other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as
promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate
and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name
of a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof
that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the
Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.



 

21 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Article II_.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock one year after the Effective Time
shall be returned to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged his or her shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.1_ prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for delivery of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Surviving Entity shall not be liable to any holder of
shares for any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of CBOT Holdings Class A Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of CME Holdings
Class A Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.1_.
Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
record holder of the shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of such shares of CME Holdings Class A Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of CME Holdings Class A Common Stock, all shares of CME Holdings Class
A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 [ _Reserved_.]

Section 2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in



 

22 exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of CBOT Holdings Class A
Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

Section 2.4  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to _Article I_ and
_Article II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity or Taxing Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of CBOT Holdings
Class A Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.5 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of CBOT Holdings, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
CBOT Holdings, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

Section 2.6 _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, no certificates representing shares of
CME Holdings Class A Common Stock or cash shall be delivered to a Person who
may be deemed an "affiliate" of CBOT Holdings in accordance with _Section
6.12_ hereof for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, until such
Person has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement to CME Holdings.

supplemented or amended or at the time it becomes effective under the

of ERISA), that increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction
in plan benefits or the imposition of an excise tax, or that the Multiemployer
Plan is or may become "insolvent" (within the meaning of Section 4241 of

the extent this representation applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of
Title IV of ERISA, it is made not only with respect to CME Holdings Benefit
Plans but also with respect to any employee CME Holdings Benefit Plan,
program, agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which CME
Holdings or any CME Holdings ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make,
contributions during the five-year period ending on the Closing. No CME
Holdings Benefit Plan subject to the minimum funding requirements of Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or any trust established thereunder
has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302
of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last
day of the most recent fiscal year of such CME Holdings Benefit Plan ended
prior to the date hereof, and all contributions required to be made with
respect thereto (whether pursuant to the terms of any such CME
Holdings Benefit Plan or otherwise) on or prior to the date hereof have been
timely made. Any cessation of benefit accruals under a CME Holdings Benefit
Plan was effected in accordance with any applicable requirements of ERISA and
the Code, including (to the extent applicable) Section 204(h) of ERISA.
Neither CME Holdings nor any CME Holdings ERISA Affiliate has any reasonable
expectation of liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan.

(d) Each CME Holdings Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS as to its qualification and, to the knowledge of CME
Holdings, no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in
disqualification of such CME Holdings Benefit Plan.



 

58 (e) Each of the CME Holdings Benefit Plans has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable
laws, including ERISA and the Code.

(f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any current or former employee or director of CME Holdings or
any CME Holdings Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due to any such current or former employee or
director or (iii) result in any prohibited transaction described in Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which an exemption is not
available.

(g) With respect to each CME Holdings Benefit Plan that is funded wholly or
partially through an insurance policy, neither CME Holdings nor any CME
Holdings Subsidiary has any current liability under any such insurance policy
in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or
other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of
events occurring prior to the Closing.

(h) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of CME Holdings, threatened
claims by or on behalf of any of the CME Holdings Benefit Plans, by any
employee or beneficiary covered under any CME Holdings Benefit Plan or
otherwise involving any CME Holdings Benefit Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits).

(i) Neither CME Holdings nor any CME Holdings Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract or arrangement that could result, separately or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code or in respect of which a deduction has
been or could be disallowed pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. No current
or former employee or director of CME Holdings or any CME Holdings Subsidiary
is entitled to receive any additional payment from CME Holdings or any CME
Holdings Subsidiary or the Surviving Entity by reason of the excise tax
required by Section 4999(a) of the Code being imposed on such person by
reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(j) Neither CME Holdings, any CME Holdings Subsidiary, CME Holdings ERISA
Affiliate, any CME Holdings Benefit Plan, any trust created thereunder, nor
any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in
connection that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a civil
liability under either Section 409 of ERISA or Section 502(i) of ERISA or a
tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

(k) No "leased employees," as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the
Code, perform services for CME Holdings, any CME Holdings Subsidiary or any
CME Holdings ERISA Affiliate. Neither CME Holdings, any CME Holdings
Subsidiary or any CME Holdings ERISA Affiliate has used the services of
workers provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary employees,
such "leased employees," or individuals who have provided services as
independent contractors to an extent that would reasonably be expected to
result in the disqualification of any CME Holdings Benefit Plan or the
imposition of penalties or excise taxes with respect to any Plan by the IRS,
the Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity.



 

59 (l) Neither CME Holdings, any CME Holdings Subsidiary nor any CME Holdings
ERISA Affiliate is a party to any agreement or understanding, whether written
or unwritten, with the IRS, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation.

(m) No representations or communications, oral or written, with respect to the
participation, eligibility for benefits, vesting, benefit accrual or coverage
under any CME Holdings Benefit Plan have been made to employees, directors
or agents (or any of their representatives or beneficiaries) of CME Holdings,
any CME Holdings Subsidiary or any CME Holdings ERISA Affiliate that are not
in accordance with the terms and conditions of CME Holdings Benefit Plans.

(n) No CME Holdings Benefit Plan provides benefits, including death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or
former employees or directors of CME Holdings or any CME Holdings Subsidiary
beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage mandated solely by applicable law, (ii) death benefits or retirement
benefits under any "employee pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), (iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the
books of CME Holdings or a CME Holdings Subsidiary or (iv) benefits the full
costs of which are borne by the current or former employee or director or his
or her beneficiary.

(o) With respect to each of CME Holdings Benefit Plan, the provisions of
Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, and any similar
local law have been complied with in all material respects.

(p) Each stock option or stock appreciation right issued with respect to CME
Holdings Class A Common Stock was granted with a per-share exercise or base
price, as the case may be, not less than the fair market value of a share of
CME Holdings Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.

(q) With respect to each CME Holdings Benefit Plan established or maintained
outside of the U.S. primarily for benefit of employees of CME Holdings or any
CME Holdings Subsidiary residing outside of the U.S. (a " _Foreign CME
Holdings Benefit Plan_ "): (i) all employer and employee contributions to
each Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan required by law or by the terms of such
Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued,
in accordance with normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan, the liability of
each insurer for any Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign CME Holdings Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all current and
former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations; and (iii) each Foreign CME Holdings Benefit Plan
required to be registered has been registered and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

Holdings Stockholder Approval or, in the case of CBOT Holdings, the CBOT
Holdings Stockholder Approval (each, as applicable, the " _Stockholder
Approval_ ") in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal (so long as
such Takeover Proposal was not initiated, solicited or facilitated, directly
or indirectly, by a breach of this _Section 6.5_ and the Party in receipt of
such Takeover Proposal has otherwise complied with the terms of this _Section
6.5(a)_ with respect to such Takeover Proposal), and subject to compliance

making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in
accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing terms and conditions
no less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions
that would prevent CME Holdings or CBOT Holdings, as applicable, from
complying with its obligation to provide the required disclosure to the other
Party pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_, and provided further that all such
information provided to such Person has previously been provided to the other
Party or is provided to the other Party prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; and

(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its
Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

provided, in each case, that the Board of Directors of CME Holdings or CBOT
Holdings, as the case may be, or in the case of CBOT Holdings, the CBOT
Holdings Special Committee, determines in good faith after consultation with
its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that (i) the failure to furnish such information or
participate in such discussions or negotiations could reasonably be expected
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii)
such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal. Each of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings shall (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons or their Representatives
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and will request the prompt return of any confidential information
previously furnished to such Persons that has not been previously returned
in connection therewith and (B) use its commercially reasonable efforts
promptly to inform its Representatives of the obligations



 

78 undertaken in this _Section 6.5_. Without limiting the foregoing, any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any
Representative of CME Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by CME Holdings and any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section 6.5_ by any Representative of CBOT
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.5_ by CBOT Holdings.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by CME Holdings or CBOT
Holdings of any Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24 hours after
the receipt thereof, such Party shall provide oral and written notice to the
other Party of (i) such Takeover Proposal, (ii) the identity of the Person
making any such Takeover Proposal and (iii) the material terms and conditions
of any such Takeover Proposal (including any amendments or material
modifications thereto). Each Party shall keep the other Party informed on a
timely basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal (and, in any event,
upon the request of the other Party), including any amendments or material
modifications to the terms and conditions thereof, and promptly provide the
other Party with copies of all Takeover Proposals (and amendments or material
modifications thereof) and related agreements, draft agreements exchanged by
the Parties and modifications thereof.

(c) (I) Neither the Board of Directors of CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings or CBOT
nor any committee of any such Board of Directors shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) effect a Change in the CME Holdings Recommendation or a Change
in the CBOT Holdings Recommendation (as applicable, a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve any Alternative Agreement.

(II) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 6.5(c)(I)_, at any time
prior to the applicable Stockholder Approval, the applicable Board of
Directors or, in the case of CBOT Holdings, the CBOT Holdings Special
Committee, may, in response to a Superior Proposal, effect a Change in
Recommendation and recommend such Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such Board of Directors or the CBOT Holdings Special Committee, as
applicable, may not effect such a Change in Recommendation or make such
recommendation unless (i) such Board of Directors or the CBOT Holdings
Special Committee, as applicable, shall have first provided prior written
notice to the other Party that it is prepared to effect such a Change in
Recommendation or make such recommendation in response to a Superior
Proposal, which notice shall attach the most current version of any written
agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal
and (ii) the other Party does not make, within five Business Days after the
receipt of such notice (or, in the event of a Takeover Proposal that has been
materially revised or modified, within two Business Days of such modification,
if later), a proposal that such Board of Directors or the CBOT Holdings
Special Committee, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is at least as
favorable, in the aggregate (taking into account all of the factors and
other aspects of such proposal included in the definition of Superior
Proposal), to its stockholders as such Superior Proposal (" _Matching Bid_ ").
Each of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings agrees that, during the five Business
Day period prior to its effecting a Change in Recommendation, it and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the other Party and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the other Party.



 

79 (III) If pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)(II)_ either Party effects a Change in
Recommendation, the other Party shall have the option (the " _Stockholder
Vote Option_ "), exercisable within five Business Days after such Change in
Recommendation, to cause the applicable Board of Directors to submit this
Agreement to its stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and
approving the Merger; and, in the case of a Change in CBOT Holdings
Recommendation, CME Holdings shall also have the option, exercisable within
five Business Days after such Change in CBOT Holdings Recommendation, to
cause the CBOT Board of Directors to submit the approvals necessary to obtain
the CBOT Membership Approval to the holders of the B-1 and the B-2 Membership
Interests. If the other Party exercises the Stockholder Vote Option, it shall
not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_
or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_, as applicable. If the other Party fails to exercise
the Stockholder Vote Option, the Party receiving the Takeover Proposal may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section
8.1(c)(iv)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iv)_, as applicable. In addition to the
foregoing, none of CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings or CBOT shall submit to
the vote of its stockholders or Members, as applicable, any Takeover Proposal
other than the Merger.

(IV) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 6.5(c)(I)_, in
circumstances other than as provided in _Section 6.5(c)(II)_, at any time
prior to the applicable Stockholder Approval, the applicable Board of
Directors or, in the case of CBOT Holdings, the CBOT Holdings Special
Committee may effect a Change in Recommendation if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is required
for such Board of Directors or the CBOT Holdings Special Committee, as
applicable, to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, but
only after (A) providing written notice to CME Holdings or CBOT Holdings, as
applicable, that it is prepared to make the determination permitted by this
_Section 6.5(c)(IV)_ and setting forth the reasons therefore and (B) for a
period of five Business Days after providing such notice (or such shorter
period (not less than two Business Days) as set forth in such notice) that
such Board of Directors or committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, is required under applicable Law in light
of the circumstances surrounding such proposed Change in Recommendation), the
Party whose Board of Directors or committee is proposing to effect a Change
in Recommendation negotiates with the other Party in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable its
Board of Directors or committee to proceed with its recommendation of
this Agreement, and at the end of such period the applicable Board of
Directors or committee maintains its determination permitted by this _Section
6.5(c)(IV)_ (after taking into account the proposed adjustments).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit CME Holdings, CBOT
Holdings or CBOT from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Takeover Proposal or
making any disclosure to the stockholders or Members (as applicable) of CME
Holdings, CBOT Holdings or CBOT if its Board of Directors or, with respect to
CBOT Holdings, the CBOT Holdings Special Committee determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that such disclosure is required
for such Board of Directors or the CBOT Holdings Special Committee, as
applicable, to comply with its obligations under applicable Law, provided,
however that neither the Board of Directors of CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings or
CBOT nor any committee of such Board of Directors shall, except as expressly
permitted by _Section 6.5(c)_, effect a Change in Recommendation or approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Takeover
Proposal.

which transaction its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, (x) would be, if consummated, more favorable to
its stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and
conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any proposal by
the other Party to amend the terms of this Agreement) as well as any other
factors deemed relevant by the applicable Board of Directors and (y) is
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all relevant financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.

Holdings, as the case may be, in respect of (i) a merger, consolidation,
business combination, share exchange, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving it or any of its

its consolidated assets (any of the foregoing, a " _Business Combination
Transaction_ ") with any Person other than CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings or any
Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party_ ") in which such Third Party or
the stockholders of the Third Party immediately prior to consummation of such
Business Combination Transaction will own more than 20% of its outstanding
capital stock immediately following such Business Combination Transaction,
including the issuance by it of more than 20% of any class of its voting
equity securities as consideration for assets or securities of a Third Party
or (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition, whether by tender or exchange
offer or otherwise, by any Third Party of 20% or more of any class of its

restrict the rights of CBOT Holdings or CME Holdings under this  _Section
6.5_.

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits, the
Surviving Entity shall recognize the service of each employee of
CBOT Holdings and any CBOT Holdings Subsidiary who remains in the employment
of the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Continuing Employee_
") with CBOT Holdings or its Affiliates before the Effective Time as if such
service had been performed with CME Holdings or its Affiliates (i) for all
purposes under the CBOT Holdings Benefit Plans maintained by the Surviving
Entity or its Affiliates after the Effective Time (to the extent such plans,
programs, or agreements are made available to Continuing Employees), (ii) for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans and
programs of the Surviving Entity or its ERISA Affiliates other than the CBOT
Holdings Benefit Plans (the " _Surviving Entity Plans_ ") in which the
Continuing Employee participates after the Effective Time, and (iii) for
benefit accrual purposes under any Surviving Entity Plan that is a vacation or
severance plan in which the Continuing Employee participates after the

exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare
plans maintained by CBOT Holdings or its Affiliates prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under
any such plan.

(c) The Surviving Entity shall honor in accordance with their terms the CBOT
Holdings Benefit Plans listed on  _Section 6.6(c)_ of the CBOT Holdings

such (or substantially similar) concept.

(d) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement, neither CBOT Holdings nor CME Holdings shall
solicit for hire in any capacity other than as an employee of the Surviving
Entity any employees who are members of management of the other Party or any
of its Subsidiaries so long as such employees are employed by the other Party
or any such Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
_Section 6.6(d)_ shall in no way prohibit any Party from engaging in
the general trade solicitation of employees so long as such solicitation is
not directed specifically at employees of the other Party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

hereby.

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance _. From
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall (i) indemnify and
hold harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),

connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement
of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and employees of
CBOT Holdings and the CBOT Holdings Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities)
(the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") (A) to the same extent such persons are 



 

82 indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by CBOT Holdings pursuant to CBOT Holdings Constituent
Documents and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date
hereof with any Indemnified Persons and (B) without limitation to clause (A),

liability insurance (" _D and O Insurance_") maintained by CBOT Holdings
(provided that the Surviving Entity (or any successor) may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby); and provided, further, that in no event
shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend in any one year more than
250% of the current annual premium expended by CBOT Holdings and the CBOT
Holdings Subsidiaries to maintain or procure such D and O Insurance immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
"); provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium. The obligations of the Surviving Entity under this
_Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies without
the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_). The rights of any Indemnified
Person under this _Section 6.8_ shall be in addition to any other rights such
Indemnified Person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws
of the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL, or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger. In the event the Surviving Entity or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, the

successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings shall

by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any

communication with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or
consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6.1_, neither CME Holdings nor CBOT Holdings shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure
concerning the other Party or the other Partys business, financial condition
or results of operations without the consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 

83 Section 6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. CBOT Holdings and CBOT shall

Holdings or CBOT, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder,

thereof. CBOT Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each

combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings and their respective Boards of Directors

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, the obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any
Party hereto with respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions
of _Section 6.3_ and the provisions of _Section 6.17_, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_ (which, subject to the proviso of this sentence, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Party receiving payment
thereunder) and _Article IX_ , each of which shall remain in full force and
effect; provided, however, that no Party hereto shall be relieved or released
from any liability or damages arising from a willful breach of any provision
of this Agreement. For purposes of clarification, it is understood and agreed
that the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3_ shall not
preclude the party receiving such Termination Fee in the case of a
willful breach of this Agreement by the other Party from seeking additional
damages from such other Party on account of such willful breach.

available funds, the sum of $240.0 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if

_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iv)_, then CBOT Holdings shall pay
the entire Termination Fee (to the extent not previously paid) on the
second Business Day following such termination; and

(ii) (x) if this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to  _Section
8.1(c)(i)_ if the breach giving rise to such termination was willful, (B)



 

90 pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)(A)_ or (C) pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ without a vote of the stockholders of CBOT Holdings or the Members
of CBOT contemplated by this Agreement at the CBOT Holdings Meetings having
occurred, _and_ in any such case a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors of CBOT
Holdings (or any person shall have publicly announced or communicated a bona
fide intention, whether or not conditional, to make a Takeover Proposal) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of the taking
of the vote of the stockholders of CBOT Holdings and the Members of CBOT
contemplated by this Agreement at the CBOT Holdings Meetings, in the case of
clause (B), or the date of termination, in the case of clauses (A) or (C),
and (y) if within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, CBOT
Holdings enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the
transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then CBOT Holdings shall
pay the Termination Fee on the second Business Day following the date CBOT
Holdings enters into a definitive agreement or consummates such transaction;
_provided_ , that, solely for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, the
term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in
_Section 6.5(e)_, except that all references to 20% shall be changed to 30%.

(b) CME Holdings shall pay to CBOT Holdings, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Termination Fee if this Agreement is terminated
as follows:

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_,
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iv)_, then CME Holdings shall pay
the entire Termination Fee (to the extent not previously paid) on the second
Business Day following such termination; and

(ii) (x) if this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_
if the breach giving rise to such termination was willful, (B) pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)(B)_ or (C) pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ without a
vote of the stockholders of CME Holdings contemplated by this Agreement at the
CME Holdings Stockholders Meeting having occurred, _and_ in any such case a
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated
to the Board of Directors of CME Holdings (or any person shall have publicly
announced or communicated a bona fide intention, whether or not conditional,
to make a Takeover Proposal) at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the date of the taking of the vote of the stockholders of CME
Holdings contemplated by this Agreement at the CME Holdings Stockholders
Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or the date of termination, in the case of
clauses (A) or (C), and (y) if within twelve (12) months after the date of
such termination, CME Holdings enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any Takeover
Proposal, then CME Holdings shall pay the Termination fee on the second
Business Day following the date CME Holdings enters into a definitive
agreement or consummates such transaction; _provided_ , that, solely for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 6.5(e)_, except that all
references to 20% shall be changed to 30%.



 

91 (c) If a Party is required to pay a Termination Fee, such Party shall, in
addition to any Termination Fee that may be payable, reimburse CME Holdings
or CBOT Holdings, as the case may be, for all of its Expenses, up to a maximum
amount of Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000), within one Business Day of receipt
of written notice from such other Party requesting payment thereof.

(d) The Parties each agree that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if a Party fails promptly to pay any amounts due under
this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, CME Holdings or
CBOT Holdings, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against such Party for such amounts, such Party shall pay interest on such
amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual
payment at the prime rate of the Bank of New York in effect on the date such
payment was due, together with the costs and expenses of the other Party
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation_.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules,
such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received
counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by telecopy or otherwise) by the
other Party hereto.



 

93 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure letters
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than _Section
6.8_ (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such Persons).

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by either of
the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

Section 9.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of CBOT Holdings, the members of CBOT or the
stockholders of CME Holdings, but, after such approval, no amendment shall be
made which by law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant
stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.



 

94 Section 9.10 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. The Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America

relating to this Agreement the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding
for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it
is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in such a Delaware State or Federal court. The Parties
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such Parties solely for such purpose and over the subject matter of such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.2_ or in
such other manner as may be permitted by law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

DIVISION A 

PREFERRED STOCK

The rights, preferences and privileges and qualifications, limitations and
restrictions granted to and imposed on the shares of Preferred Stock of the
corporation shall be as set forth below in this Division A.

Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued in one or more series at such time or
times, and for such consideration or considerations, as the board
of directors shall determine. The board of directors is hereby authorized to
fix, state and establish, in the resolution or resolutions providing for the
issuance of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, the relative
powers, rights, designations, preferences, qualifications, limitations and
restrictions of such series in relation to any other series of Preferred Stock
at the time outstanding. The board of directors is also expressly authorized
to fix the number of shares of each such series, but not below the number of
shares thereof then outstanding. The authority of the board of directors with
respect to each series of Preferred Stock shall include (without limitation)
the determination of the following:

 

(a) the dividend rate on the shares of such series, whether dividends shall be
cumulative, and, if so, from which date or dates, and the rights of priority,
if any, with respect to the payment of dividends on the shares of such series
relative to other series of Preferred Stock or classes of stock;

(b) whether the shares of such series shall have voting rights (other than the
voting rights provided by law) and, if so, the terms and extent of such voting
rights;

(c) whether the shares of such series shall have conversion privileges, and,
if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion, including provision
for adjustment of the conversion rate upon the occurrence of such events as
the board of directors may prescribe;

(d) whether the shares of such series shall be subject to redemption by the
corporation or at the request of the holder(s) thereof, and, if so, the terms
and conditions of any such redemption;

(e) the rights of the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation, and the
rights of priority, if any, with respect to the distribution of assets on the

of stock; and



 

2 (f) any other preferences, privileges and powers, and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such series, as the board of directors may deem advisable and
as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation, as the same may be amended from time to time.

* * * * 

Pursuant to the above stated authority, the board of directors has designated
the following series of Preferred Stock:

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.

The shares of such series shall be designated as " _Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock_ " and the number of shares constituting such
series shall be 140,000.

SECTION 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.

(a) The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board
of directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly
dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "
_Quarterly Dividend Payment Date_ "), commencing on the first Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share
(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (x) $.01 or (y) subject
to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the
aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the
aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or
other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common
Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Class A Common Stock, since
the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect
to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any
share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
In the event the corporation shall at any time after the date of consummation
of the merger of CME Merger Subsidiary Inc. with and into the Exchange (as
defined below) (the " _Rights Declaration Date_ ") (i) declare any dividend on
Class A Common Stock payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii)
subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock, or (iii) combine the
outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each
such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior
Participating  



 

3  Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause
(y) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of
which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

(b) The corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Paragraph (a) above
immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Class A Common
Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock);
provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been
declared on the Class A Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,
a dividend of $.01 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date.

(c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares
is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in
which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of
issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of
holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to
receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,
in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be
cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid
dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount
of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be
allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding. The board of directors may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared
thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date
fixed for the payment thereof.

SECTION 3. VOTING RIGHTS.

The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall
have the following voting rights:

(a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder
thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders
of the corporation. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the
Rights Declaration  



 

4  Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in shares of
Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common Stock, or
(iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders
of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled
immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which
is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to such event.

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote together as one class
on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the corporation.

 (c) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a " _default period_ ") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of Preferred Stock (including holders of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock) with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two directors. 

 (ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant to Paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section 3 or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of shareholders, provided that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Preferred Stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the board of directors as may then exist up to two directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the  



 

5  required number. After the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have
exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during
the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be
increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of Preferred Stock as
herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking
senior to or _pari passu_  with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock.

(iii) Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default
period, have previously exercised their right to elect directors, the board of
directors may order, or any shareholder or shareholders owning in the
aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred
Stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of a
special meeting of the holders of Preferred Stock, which meeting shall
thereupon be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Managing
Director or the Secretary of the corporation. Notice of such meeting and of
any annual meeting at which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote
pursuant to this Paragraph (c)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of
Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him or her at his or her
last address as the same appears on the books of the corporation. Such meeting
shall be called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later than 60 days
after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting
within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on
similar notice by any shareholder or shareholders owning in the aggregate not
less than 10% of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock
outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (c)(iii), no
such special meeting shall be called during the period within 60 days
immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the
shareholders.

(iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of
stock of the corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to
elect the whole number of directors until the holders of Preferred Stock shall
have exercised their right to elect two directors voting as a class, after the
exercise of which right (x) the directors so elected by the holders
of Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have
been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period,
and (y) any vacancy in the board of directors may (except as provided in
Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the
remaining directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock
which elected the director whose office shall have become vacant. References
in this Paragraph (c) to directors elected by the holders of a particular
class of stock shall include directors elected by such directors to fill
vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.



 

6 (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock as a class to elect directors shall cease, (y) the term of any directors elected by the holders of Preferred Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws). Any vacancies in the board of directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors. 

(d) Except as set forth herein, holders of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall
not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders
of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

SECTION 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.

(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable
on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2
are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the
corporation shall not:

(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem
or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking
junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; 

(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares
of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or
in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such
shares are then entitled;

(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any
stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, provided that the corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of
any stock of the corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock; or



 

7 (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a
parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in
accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as
determined by the board of directors) to all holders of such shares upon such
terms as the board of directors, after consideration of the respective annual
dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective
series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and
equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.

(b) The corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the corporation to
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the
corporation unless the corporation could, under Paragraph (a) of this Section
4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

SECTION 5. REACQUIRED SHARES.

Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or
otherwise acquired by the corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be
retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares
shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of
Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock
to be created by resolution or resolutions of the board of directors, subject
to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.

SECTION 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.

(a) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up
of the corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of
stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless,
prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to 1,000 times the
Exercise Price, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment
(the " _Series A Liquidation Preference_ "). Following the payment of the
full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference, no additional
distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of
Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the " _Common
Adjustment_ ") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A
Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth
in Paragraph (c) of this Section 6 to reflect such events as stock splits,
stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such
number in clause (ii), the " _Adjustment Number_ "). Following the payment of
the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common
Adjustment in respect of all  



 

8  outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and
Common Stock, respectively, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock and holders of shares of both classes of Common Stock shall receive
their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be
distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such
Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

(b) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to
permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the
liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which
rank on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then
such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such
parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In
the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit
payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be
distributed ratably to the holders of both classes of Common Stock.

(c) In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in
shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect
immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and
the denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

SECTION 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.

In case the corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger,
combination or other transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock
are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any
other property, then in any such case the shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or
changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock,
securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may
be, into which or for which each share of Class A Common Stock is changed or
exchanged. In the event the corporation shall at any time after the Rights
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Class A Common Stock payable in
shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Class A Common
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Class A Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding
sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares  



 

9  of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

SECTION 8. NO REDEMPTION.

The shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall not be
redeemable.

SECTION 9. AMENDMENT.

The Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation shall not be further
amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers,
preferences or special rights of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority or more of the outstanding shares of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

SECTION 10. FRACTIONAL SHARES.

Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a
share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holders fractional
shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in
distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

such open outcry market); or

exclusively by open outcry at the Exchange, the Exchanges open outcry market
has maintained at least 30% of the open interest of such comparable product;
or

(c) if no comparable exchange-traded product exists, the open outcry market
has maintained at least 40% of the average quarterly volume in that market
during 1999 at Chicago Mercantile Exchange, an Illinois not-for-profit
corporation, the predecessor of the Exchange (including, for
calculation purposes, volume from exchange-for-physical transactions in such
open outcry market); or

(d) if no comparable exchange-traded product exists and the product trades
exclusively by open outcry, the open outcry market has maintained at least 40%
of the average open interest in that market during 1999 at Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, the predecessor of the
Exchange.

ARTICLE FIVE:

three Class B-1 Directors, two Class B-2 Directors and one Class B-3 Director.
Until the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2010 (the " _2010
Annual Meeting_ "), at least nine Equity Directors shall be CBOT Directors.
During the period starting on the Effective Time and ending on the first
business day prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting (i) it shall be a qualification
for any director to be nominated or elected by the board of directors to
replace any CME Director (whose term is expiring or has expired or who shall
have been removed or become disqualified or who shall have resigned, retired,
died or otherwise shall fail to continue to serve as a director of the
corporation) that such replacement director shall have been designated by the
CME Nominating Representatives and (ii) it shall be a qualification for any
director to be nominated or elected by the board of directors to replace any
CBOT Director (whose term is expiring or has expired or who shall have been
removed or become disqualified or who shall have resigned, retired, died or
otherwise shall fail to continue to serve as a director of the corporation)
that such replacement director shall have been designated by the CBOT
Nominating Representatives. For purposes of this certificate of incorporation,
the terms " _CME Director_ ," " _CME Nominating Representatives_ ," " _CBOT
Director_ " and " _CBOT Nominating Representatives_ " shall have the
respective meanings set forth in the corporations bylaws as in effect at the
Effective Time.



 

16 (B) The board of directors of the corporation shall be divided into three
classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class of directors
shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number
of directors constituting the entire board of directors of the corporation. At
the Effective Time, the board of directors shall consist of the members
appointed to the various classes as provided in Article X of the bylaws of the
corporation. The terms of the initial Class I directors shall expire at the
first annual meeting of shareholders to be held after the Effective Time; the
terms of the initial Class II directors shall expire at the second annual
meeting of shareholders to be held after the Effective Time; and the terms of

predecessor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any vacancy occurring with respect to a
Class B-1 Director, a Class B-2 Director or a Class B-3 Director shall be
filled from the candidates who lost for such position from the most recent
election, with the candidates being selected to fill such vacancy in the order
of the aggregate number of votes received in such previous election.

(F) No person shall be eligible for election as a Class B-1 Director, a Class
B-2 Director or a Class B-3 Director unless he or she shall own, or be
recognized as the owner for the purposes of the Exchange of, at least one
share of the class of Class B Common Stock entitled to elect such director.

(G) Any director may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause
and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
voting power of the shares entitled to elect such person as a director.



 

17 (H) During the period starting on the Effective Time and ending on the first
business day prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting, the corporation shall not
amend, modify or repeal any provision contained in this Article Five or
Article Fifteen unless such amendment, modification or repeal is approved by
(i) a majority of the CME Directors, and (ii) a majority of the CBOT
Directors.

ARTICLE SIX: The board of directors is hereby authorized to create and
issue, whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its
stock or other securities or property, rights entitling the holders thereof to
purchase from the corporation shares of Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock

Section 1.1 Annual Meetings. (a) The annual meetings of shareholders shall be
held on such date, at such time and at such place, either within or without
the state of Delaware, as shall be designated from time to time by the Board
of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. Subject to paragraph (b)
of this Section 1.1, any other proper business may be transacted at an annual
meeting.

(b) At the annual meetings the shareholders shall elect the Board of
Directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before
the meeting. For such business to be properly brought before the meeting, it
must be: (i) authorized by the Board of Directors and specified in the notice,
or a supplemental notice, of the meeting, (ii) otherwise brought before the
meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or the chairman of
the meeting, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a
shareholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting
by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given written notice thereof to
the Secretary, delivered or mailed to and received at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation (x) not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days
prior to the meeting, or (y) if less than 100 days notice of the meeting or
prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
shareholders, not later than the close of business on the tenth day following
the day on which the notice of the meeting was mailed or, if earlier, the day
on which such public disclosure was made. A shareholders notice to the
Secretary shall set forth as to each item of business the shareholder proposes
to bring before the meeting (1) a brief description of such item and the
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and a representation that
the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
introduce the business specified in the notice, (2) the name and address, as
they appear on the Corporations records, of the shareholder proposing such
business, (3) the class, and series if any, and number of shares of stock of
the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the shareholder (for purposes
of the regulations under Sections 13 and 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), and (4) any material interest of the
shareholder in such business. No business shall be conducted at any annual
meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph
(b). The chairman of the meeting at which any business is proposed by a
shareholder shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting
that such business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance
with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, in such event, the business
not properly before the meeting shall not be transacted.

Section 1.2 Special Meetings. Special meetings of shareholders for any purpose
or purposes may be called at any time only by the Chairman of the Board or by
a majority of the total number of authorized Directors. The business
transacted at a special meeting of shareholders shall be limited to the
purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called.

Section 1.3 Notice of Meetings. A written notice of each annual or special
meeting of shareholders shall be given stating the place, date and time of
the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, such notice of meeting shall be
given not less than 10 nor    more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder of
record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be
deemed to be given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to
the shareholder at such shareholders address as it appears on the records of
the Corporation. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of
the transfer agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

Section 1.4 Adjournments. Any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be
adjourned from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and
notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more
than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in accordance
with Section 1.3 of these Bylaws. 

Section 1.5 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of stock having not less than one-third of the votes which could be
cast by the holders of all outstanding stock entitled to vote at the meeting
shall constitute a quorum at each meeting of shareholders. In the absence of
a quorum, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the
shareholders may, by the affirmative vote of the holders of stock having a
majority of the votes which could be cast by all such holders, adjourn the
meeting from time to time in the manner provided in Section 1.4 of these
Bylaws until a quorum is present. If a quorum is present when a meeting is
convened, the subsequent withdrawal of shareholders, even though less than a
quorum remains, shall not affect the ability of the remaining shareholders
lawfully to transact business.

Section 1.6 Organization. Meetings of shareholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the Second Vice
Chairman of the Board or the President (in that order), or in their absence,
inability or unwillingness, by a chairman designated by the Board of
Directors, or in the absence of such designation, by a chairman chosen at the
meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or
her absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of the shareholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.

Section 1.7 Voting. (a) The shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
shareholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section
1.10 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries,
pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other
voting agreements).

(b) Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or
in these Bylaws, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law: (i) in
all matters other than the election of Directors, the affirmative vote of the
holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the shareholders; (ii) each Director shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
such Director; and (iii) where a separate vote by a class or series is
required, other than with respect to the election of Directors, the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of such class or series representing
a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting shall be the act of such class or series.

(c) Voting at meetings of shareholders need not be by written ballot and need
not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so required by Section 1.9
of these Bylaws or so determined by the holders of stock having a majority of
the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding stock
entitled to vote which are present in person or represented by proxy at such
meeting.



 

2 (d) Stock of the Corporation belonging to the Corporation, or to another
Corporation, a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
Directors of which are held by the Corporation, shall not be voted at any
meeting of shareholders and shall not be counted in the total number of
outstanding shares for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is
present. Nothing in this Section 1.7 shall limit the right of the Corporation
to vote shares of stock of the Corporation held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

Section 1.8 (a) Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders
may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy
filed with the Secretary before or at the time of the meeting. No such proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if
it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A
shareholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date.

(b) A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
shareholder as proxy (i) by executing a writing authorizing such person or
persons to act as such, which execution may be accomplished by such
shareholder or such shareholders authorized officer, Director, partner,
employee or agent (or, if the stock is held in a trust or estate, by a
trustee, executor or administrator thereof) signing such writing or causing
his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means,
including, but not limited to, facsimile signature, or (ii) by transmitting or
authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of
electronic transmission (a "Transmission") to the person who will be the
holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service
organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the
holder of the proxy to receive such Transmission; provided that any
such Transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from
which it can be determined that such Transmission was authorized by such
shareholder.

(c) Any inspector or inspectors appointed pursuant to Section 1.9 of these
Bylaws shall examine each Transmission to determine whether it is valid. If no
inspector or inspectors are so appointed, the Secretary or such other person
or persons as shall be appointed from time to time by the Board of Directors
shall examine Transmissions to determine if they are valid. If it is
determined a Transmission is valid, the person or persons making that
determination shall specify the information upon which such person or persons
relied. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction
of such a writing or Transmission may be substituted or used in lieu of the
original writing or Transmission for any and all purposes for which the
original writing or Transmission could be used; provided that such copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or Transmission. 

Section 1.9 Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Elections. (a) Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law,
the following provisions of this Section 1.9 shall apply only if and when the
Corporation has a class of voting stock that is (i) listed on a national
securities exchange, (ii) authorized for quotation on an interdealer
quotation system of a registered national securities association or (iii) held
of record by more than 2,000 shareholders.

(b) The Corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of shareholders, appoint
one or more inspectors of election (individually an "inspector," and
collectively the "inspectors") to act at  



 

3  such meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector
who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at such
meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to
act at the meeting. Each inspector of election, before entering upon the
discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of
his ability.

(c) The inspectors shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of stock of the
Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii) determine the
number of shares of stock of the Corporation present in person or by proxy
at such meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all
votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record
of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspectors and (v) certify their determination of the number of such shares
present in person or by proxy at such meeting and their count of all votes and
ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to
assist them in the performance of their duties.

(d) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each
matter upon which the shareholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced
at such meeting. No ballots, proxies or votes, nor any revocations thereof or
changes thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the
polls unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware upon application
by any shareholder shall determine otherwise.

(e) In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the
inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes
submitted with such proxies, any information referred to in paragraphs (b) and
(c) of Section 1.8 of these Bylaws, ballots and the regular books and records
of the Corporation, except that the inspectors may consider other reliable
information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots
submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or
similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is
authorized by a shareholder of record to cast or more votes than such
shareholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable
information for the limited purpose permitted herein, the inspectors, at the
time they make their certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
1.9, shall specify the precise information considered by them, including the
person or persons from whom such information was obtained, when and the means
by which such information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors
belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

Section 1.10 Fixing Date of Determination of Shareholders of Record. (a) In
order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled (i) to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment
thereof, (ii) to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights, (iii) to exercise any rights in respect of any

date, which shall not be earlier than the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and which (1) in

day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record
date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close
of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.



 

4 (c) A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting,
but the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of shareholders, a complete

Section 2.6 Quorum; Vote Required for Action. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Article X, at all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the whole
Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
Unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws otherwise provide, the
vote of a majority of the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. A meeting at which a
quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding
the withdrawal of Directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a
majority of the required quorum for that meeting.

(b) If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then
the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to

is present.

(c) Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the
General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent
to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
regular or special meeting of the Directors, or members of a committee of
Directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so
required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

Section 2.7 Telephonic Meetings. Directors, or any committee of Directors
designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the
Board of Directors or such committee by means of conference telephone or
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating
in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant
to this Section 2.7 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 2.8 Informal Action by Directors. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of
Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing
(which may be in counterparts), and the written consent or consents are filed
with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee.



 

7 Section 2.9 Reliance Upon Records. Every Director, and every member of any
committee of the Board of Directors, shall, in the performance of his or her
duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the
Corporation and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to the Corporation by any of its officers or employees, or
committees of the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to matters the
Director or member reasonably believes are within such other persons
professional or expert competence and who has been selected with
reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation, including, but not
limited to, such records, information, opinions, reports or statements as to
the value and amount of the assets, liabilities and/or net profits of the
Corporation, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of
surplus or other funds from which dividends might properly be declared and
paid, or with which the Corporations capital stock might properly be
purchased or redeemed.

Section 2.10 Interested Directors. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its Directors or officers, or between
the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other
organization in which one or more of its Directors or officers are Directors
or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely
for this reason, or solely because the Director or officer is present at or
participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof
which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because such persons
or their votes are counted for such purpose if (i) the material facts as to
such persons or their relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors be less than
a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to such persons or
their relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and the
contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
shareholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the
Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the shareholders. Common or
interested Directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum
at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the
contract or transaction.

Section 2.11 Compensation. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the
compensation of Directors. The Directors shall be paid their reasonable
expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or
a committee thereof and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each such
meeting and an annual retainer or salary for services as a Director or
committee member. No such payment shall preclude any Director from serving
the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

Section 2.12 Presumption of Assent. Unless otherwise provided by the laws of
the State of Delaware, a Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of
Directors or of a committee thereof at which action is taken on any matter
shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her
dissent shall be entered in the minutes of such meeting or unless he or she
shall file his or her written dissent to such action with the person acting as
secretary of such meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward
such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary immediately after the
adjournment of such meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a
Director who voted in favor of such action.

Stock Certificates and Transfers

Section 6.1 Certificates; Uncertificated Shares. The shares of

the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or a Managing
Director, and may be countersigned by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary,
certifying the number of shares owned by such shareholder in the Corporation.
Any of or all the signatures on a certificate may be facsimile. In case any
officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it
may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such officer,
transfer agent or registrar continued to be such at the date of issue. Upon
the request of the registered owner of uncertificated shares, the President or
his designee shall send to the registered owner a certificate representing
such shares.

In the case of uncertificated shares, within a reasonable time after the
issuance or transfer thereof, the President or his designee shall send to the
registered owner of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation a written notice
containing (i) (A) a full statement of the designations, relative rights,

any class or series; or (B) a declaration that the Corporation will furnish to
the shareholder, upon request and without charge, a statement containing the
information described in the preceding clause (A); (ii) a statement that the

transferred; (iv) the number and class of shares, and the designation of the
series, if any, to which such notice applies; and (v) any restrictions on
transfer of the shares, in accordance with Section 202 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. The notice referred to in the preceding sentence shall also
contain the following statement: "This notice is merely a record of the rights
of the addressee as of the time of its issuance. Delivery of this statement,
of itself, confers no rights on the recipient. This notice is neither a
negotiable instrument nor a security."

Section 6.2 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates. The Corporation may issue a new certificate for stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, or such shareholders legal representative,
to indemnify the Corporation and/or to give the Corporation a bond sufficient
to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of
the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate.

Section 6.3 Transfers of Stock. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the
transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for stock of the

provisions of Section 6.2 of these Bylaws, and upon payment of applicable
taxes with respect to such transfer, and in compliance with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such shares under the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or rules of the Corporation and any other
applicable transfer restrictions of which the Corporation shall have notice,
the Corporation shall issue a new certificate or certificates for such stock
to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the
transaction upon its books. Transfers of stock shall be made only on the books
of the Corporation by the registered holder thereof or by such holders
attorney or successor duly authorized as evidenced by documents filed with the
Secretary. Whenever any transfer of stock shall be  



 

12  made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so expressed
in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates
representing such stock are presented to the Corporation for transfer, both
the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do so.

Section 6.4 Transfers of Uncertificated Stock. Except as otherwise required by
law, uncertificated shares of the Corporations stock shall be transferable in
the manner prescribed in these Bylaws. Transfers of uncertificated
stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person then
registered on the books of the Corporation as the owner of such shares or by
such persons attorney lawfully constituted in writing and written instruction
to the Corporation containing the following information: (i) the class of
shares, and the designation of the series, if any, to which such notice
applies; (ii) the number of shares transferred; and (iii) the name, address
and taxpayer identification number, if any, of the party to whom the shares
have been transferred and who, as a result of such transfer, is to become the
new registered owner of the shares. No transfer of uncertificated stock shall
be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been
entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and
to whom transferred.

Section 6.5 Special Designation on Certificates. The designations, preferences
and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of
stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the Corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that,
except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the
face or back of the certificate that the Corporation shall issue to represent
such class or series of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish
without charge to each shareholder who so requests the powers, designations,
preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights
of each class of stock, or series thereof, and the qualifications limitations
or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

Section 6.6 Stock Transfer Agreements. Subject to the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation shall have power to enter into

prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Section 6.7 Registered Shareholders. The Corporation shall be entitled to
recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner
of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled
to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books
as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another
person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except
as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

Section 6.8 Other Regulations. The issue, transfer, conversion and
registration of stock certificates shall be governed by such other regulations
as the Board of Directors may establish.

ARTICLE VII

Notices

Section 7.1 Manner of Notice. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, whenever notice is required to
be given to any shareholder, Director or member of any committee of the Board
of Directors, such notice may be given by personal delivery or by depositing
it, in a sealed envelope, in the United States mails, first class, postage
prepaid, addressed, or by  



 

13  transmitting it via telecopier, to such shareholder, Director or member,
either at the address of such shareholder, Director or member as it appears on
the records of the Corporation or, in the case of such a Director or member,
at his or her business address; and such notice shall be deemed to be given at
the time when it is thus personally delivered, deposited or transmitted, as
the case may be. Such requirement for notice shall also be deemed satisfied,
except in the case of shareholder meetings, if actual notice is received
orally or by other writing by the person entitled thereto as far in advance of
the event with respect to which notice is being given as the minimum notice
period required by law or these Bylaws.

Section 7.2 Dispensation with Notice. (a) Whenever notice is required to be
given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to any
shareholder to whom (i) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
shareholders, and all notices of meetings of shareholders or (ii) all, and at
least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or interest on
securities of the Corporation during a 12-month period, have been mailed
addressed to such shareholder at the address of such shareholder as shown on
the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the
giving of such notice to such shareholder shall not be required. Any action or
meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such shareholder shall
have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any
such shareholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting
forth the then current address of such shareholder, the requirement that
notice be given to such shareholder shall be reinstated. 

(b) Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws to any person with whom communication is
unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required, and
there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a
license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or
meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with
whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such
notice had been duly given.

Section 7.3 Waiver of Notice. Any written waiver of notice, signed by the
person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, Directors, or
members of a committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver
of notice.

ARTICLE VIII

Indemnification

Section 8.1 Right to Indemnification. In addition and subject to the
indemnification provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, and
subject to applicable law, the following Sections of this Article VIII shall
apply with respect to any person subject to the indemnification provisions of

to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise. The Corporation may
require security for any such undertaking.

Section 8.3 Claims. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses
under this Article VII is not paid in full within 60 days after a written
claim therefor has been received by the Corporation,  



 

14  the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and,
if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense
of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation shall have the
burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested
indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

Section 8.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other rights which
such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of shareholders or
disinterested Directors or otherwise.

Section 8.5 Other Indemnification. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a Director,
officer, employee, partner or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person may
collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other enterprise.

Section 8.6 Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

ARTICLE IX

render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

holding and the remaining provisions of these Bylaws (including without
limitation, all portions of any Section of these Bylaws containing any such
provision held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with
the Certificate of Incorporation, that are not themselves invalid, illegal,

stock. Dividends may be paid only in cash or in property. The Board of
Directors may set apart out of any of the funds of the Corporation available

Board of Directors nor any committee thereof (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Class B Nominating Committee) shall nominate (or cause there to
be nominated) as a Director any person not designated as a nominee by either
the CME Nominating Representatives or the CBOT Nominating Representatives, as
applicable, pursuant to the foregoing.

otherwise cannot or will not continue to serve as a member of the Board of
Directors, the CME Nominating Representatives shall have the exclusive power
on behalf  



 

17  of the entire Board of Directors to designate a person to fill such vacancy,

opportunities of the holders of the Class B Memberships, such change will be
submitted to a committee of the Board comprised of three CBOT Directors

3\. _Conversion Rights of Series B-3 Memberships_.

(a) _Conversion_. Subject to, and upon compliance with, the provisions of this
Section D(3) of Article IV, any two (2) Series B-3 Memberships shall be
convertible at the option of the holder into one (1) Series B-2 Membership.

(b) _Mechanics of Conversion_. A holder of Series B-3 Memberships may exercise
the conversion right specified in Section D(3)(a) of Article IV by delivering
to the Corporation or any transfer agent of the Corporation written notice
stating that the holder elects to convert such memberships, accompanied by the
certificates or other instruments, if any, representing the memberships to be
converted. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when
delivery of such written notice, accompanied by such certificate or other
instrument, if any, is made, and such date is referred to herein as the
Conversion Date. As promptly as practicable after the Conversion Date, the
Corporation may issue and deliver to or upon the written order of such holder
a certificate or other instrument, if any, representing the number of Series
B-2 Memberships to which such holder is entitled as a result of the exercise
of such conversion right. The person in whose name the certificates or other
instruments representing Series B-2 Memberships are to be issued shall be
deemed to have become the holder of record of such Series B-2 Memberships on
the applicable Conversion Date.



 

7 (c) _Memberships Reserved for Issuance_. The Corporation shall take all
actions necessary to reserve and make available at all times for issuance
upon the conversion of Series B-3 Memberships, such number of Series B-2
Memberships as are issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding Series B-3
Memberships.

E. _Commitment to Maintain Open Outcry Markets_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section E of Article IV, the Corporation shall
maintain open outcry markets operating as of April 22, 2005 (the "Effective
Date") and provide financial support to each such market for technology,
marketing and research, which the Board of Directors determines, in its sole
and absolute discretion, is reasonably necessary to maintain each such open
outcry market.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors may discontinue any open outcry market
at such time and in such manner as it may determine if (1) the Board of
Directors determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that a market is
no longer "liquid" or (2) the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the then outstanding Series B-1 Memberships and Series B-2 Memberships, voting
together as a single class based on their respective voting rights, approve
the discontinuance of such open outcry market.

For purposes of the foregoing, an open outcry market will be deemed "liquid"
for so long as it meets either of the following tests, in each case as
measured on a quarterly basis:

(a) if a comparable exchange-traded product exists, the open outcry market
has maintained at least 30 percent (30%) of the average daily volume of such
comparable product (including for calculation purposes, volume from Exchange-
For-Physicals transactions in such open outcry market); or

(b) if no comparable exchange-traded product exists, the open outcry market

8 ARTICLE VIIIINDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

Section 1\. _Right to Indemnification_.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, officer, committee
member or employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a Director, officer, trustee, committee member or employee
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a Director, officer, trustee, committee
member or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a Director,
officer, trustee, committee member or employee, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section 3 of this Article VIII with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Section 2\. _Right to Advancement of Expenses_.

The right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII shall
include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its
final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided,
however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter
an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision
from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a
"final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and
2 of this Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall
continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a Director, officer,
committee member or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators. 

Section 3\. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_.

If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by
the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received
by the Corporation,  



 

9  except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover
such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its members) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee
to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses
hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

Section 4\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.

The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in
this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of members or
disinterested Directors or otherwise.

Section 5\. _Insurance_.

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any Director, officer, committee member, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.

Section 6\. _Indemnification of Agents of the Corporation_.

The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board
of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.



 

10 ---|---|--- 

Any member or member firm who fails to prevail in a lawsuit or any other type
of legal proceeding instituted by that member or member firm against the
Corporation or any of its officers, Directors, committee members, employees or
agents must pay to the Corporation all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, incurred by the Corporation in the defense of such
proceeding. Any member or member firm required to compensate the Corporation
pursuant to this section shall be assessed interest on such amount at the
rate of Prime plus one percent (1%), which interest shall accrue from the date
such amount was demanded in writing after the member or member firm failed to
prevail in a lawsuit or any other type of legal proceeding against
the Corporation.

ARTICLE IXAMENDMENTS

Bylaws of the Corporation. The Class A Member, acting pursuant to a resolution
adopted by its Board of Directors, shall also have power to adopt, amend or
repeal the Bylaws. The only member of the Corporation with any power to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation shall be the Class A Member, and

The undersigned has been advised and understands that as of the date of this
Agreement the undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of CBOT Holdings,
as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ ").

The undersigned is entering into this Agreement as an inducement and
consideration to CME Holdings to enter into the Merger Agreement and to
consummate the Merger Transactions.

1\. The undersigned hereby represents, warrants and covenants to CME Holdings
that in the event the undersigned receives any CME Holdings Common Stock as a
result of the Merger Transactions:

(a) The undersigned shall not make any offer, sale, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of shares of CME Holdings Common Stock in violation of the Act or
the Rules and Regulations.

(b) The undersigned has carefully read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement
and discussed the requirements of such documents and other    applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of CME Holdings Common Stock, to the extent the
undersigned believed necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for
CBOT Holdings.

(c) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of CME Holdings Common
Stock to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger Transactions will be
registered with the Commission under the Act on a registration statement on
Form S-4. However, the undersigned has also been advised that, because at the
time the Merger Transactions are submitted for a vote of the stockholders of
CBOT Holdings, (i) the undersigned may be deemed to be an affiliate of CBOT
Holdings and (ii) the distribution by the undersigned of CME Holdings
Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, the undersigned may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of CME Holdings Common Stock
issued to the undersigned in the Merger Transactions unless (A) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, (B) such
sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act or (C)
in the written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to CME Holdings, or
pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of
the Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.

(d) If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Act, the
undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of CME Holdings
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of CBOT
Holdings Common Stock in connection with the Merger Transactions may be
restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Act or an
exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned understands
that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will
obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions,
including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such
securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Act. The undersigned
understands that CME Holdings is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of CME Holdings Common Stock by the undersigned
or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act or to take any other action
necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.

(e) The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will be
given to CME Holdings transfer agent with respect to CME Holdings Common
Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger Transactions, and there will be
placed on the respective certificates for such CME Holdings Common Stock a
legend stating in substance:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION
TO WHICH RULE 145  



 

2  PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"),
APPLIES AND MAY BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LIMITATIONS OF SUCH RULE 145, OR UPON RECEIPT BY
CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE HOLDINGS INC. OF AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN
OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT
SUCH SALE, TRANSFER OR OTHER DISPOSITION IS OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE ACT, PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT
OR IN A MANNER IN CONFORMITY WITH AND AFTER RECEIPT OF A NO-ACTION LETTER
FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION."

(f) The undersigned also understands that, unless a transfer is made in
compliance with Rule 145(d) under the Act, CME Holdings reserves the right to
place, as applicable, on the certificates issued to the undersigneds
transferee with respect to CME Holdings Common Stock a legend stating in
substance:

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"), AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A
PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED
UNDER THE ACT APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A
VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF
WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ACT AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT."

(g) In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the
shares of CME Holdings Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will
supply CME Holdings with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form
of a letter in the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-
action letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that CME Holdings
may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of CME
Holdings Common Stock disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such
transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this Agreement) upon
receipt of such evidence of compliance, CME Holdings shall cause the transfer
agent to effectuate the transfer of the shares of CME Holdings Common Stock
sold as indicated in such letter.



 

3 (h) It is understood and agreed that certificates with the legends set forth
in paragraphs 1(e) and (f) above will, after surrender of such certificates,
be substituted by delivery of certificates without such legends if (i) one
year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Act)
shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the CME Holdings
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Transactions, and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned, (ii) two years (or such other
period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act) shall have elapsed
from the date the undersigned acquired the CME Holdings Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger Transactions, and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then
applicable to the undersigned, or (iii) CME Holdings has received either a
written opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to CME Holdings, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the
undersigned from the staff of the Commission, to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 144 and Rule 145 under the Act no longer apply to
the undersigned.

(i) Execution of this Agreement shall not be considered an admission on the
undersigneds part that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of CBOT Holdings as
described in the second paragraph of this Agreement, nor as a waiver of any
rights the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned
is such an affiliate.

2\. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its principles or
rules of conflicts of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
