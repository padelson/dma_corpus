     |   |   | way with, any effort or attempt by any other person to
make or complete an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval or recommendation of the Board or the Special Committee of the
Arrangement, (iv) approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or remain neutral with respect to, any
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking no position or
a neutral position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until ten Business
Days following the public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not
be considered a violation of this Section 7.1(1)) or (v) accept or enter
into, or propose publicly to accept or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, agreement, contract, arrangement or undertaking in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal; provided that nothing contained in this

other actions as contemplated by this Section 7.1, in each case solely in the
manner and under the circumstances set forth in this Section 7.1 or Section
7.2, as the case may be, and in each case where the Acquisition Proposal in
question:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | did not result from a breach of any agreement
between the person making such Acquisition Proposal and Maple or any of its
Subsidiaries or a breach of this Section 7.1;

    | (d)  |   | in respect of which the Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and its
external counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and  
      
    | (e)  |   | in respect of which the Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and its
external counsel, would, if consummated in accordance with its terms (but not
assuming away any risk of non-completion), result in a transaction that: (A)
is reasonably capable of completion in accordance with its terms without
undue delay, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the person making such Acquisition
Proposal; (B) is more favourable from a financial point of view to Maple
Shareholders than the Arrangement after giving effect to any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Section 7.2, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, and (C) is not subject to any financing
condition and in respect of which any  #####

to constitute, an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal and, in connection
therewith, Maple shall discontinue access to such person to the Data Room
(and not establish or allow access to any other data rooms, virtual or
otherwise, or otherwise furnish information). Maple agrees not to release any
third party from, and shall enforce, any confidentiality agreement relating
to a potential Acquisition Proposal to which such third party is a party.
Maple further agrees not to release any third party from, and shall enforce,
any standstill agreement or provision to which such third party is a party.
Maple shall immediately request the return or destruction of all
information provided to any third party which has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Maple relating to a potential Acquisition
Proposal to the extent that such information has not previously been returned
or destroyed, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that such requests are honoured.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (3)  |   | Maple shall immediately (and in any event within
24 hours of receipt by Maple) notify Parent of, at first orally and then in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case received after the date hereof of which
any of its directors or officers become aware, or any amendments to the
foregoing, or any request for non-public information relating to Maple or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or for access to
the properties, books or records of Maple or any of its Subsidiaries by any
person that informs Maple or such Subsidiary that it is considering making,
or has made, an Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto and if in
writing or electronic form, a copy thereof, and if not in writing or
electronic form, a description of the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and shall provide the identity of the person
making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and such other details of the
proposal or inquiry as Parent may reasonably request. Maple shall keep Parent
fully informed of the status, including any change to the material terms, of
any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (4)  |   | If at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement Resolution
by the Maple Shareholders at the Meeting, Maple receives a written
Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a breach of this Section 7.1 that the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and external counsel, constitutes or is reasonably likely to
constitute (assuming completion of a due diligence review not exceeding 10
days from the date of Maple first determining that it is permitted to
disclose non-public information to such person making the Acquisition
Proposal under this Section 7.1(4) (the "Restricted Period")) if consummated
in accordance with its terms (but not assuming away any risk of non-
completion) a Superior Proposal, then Maple may, subject to compliance with
Section 7.1(3):  
---|---|---|--- 
   ##### 

 

   

47 

   

       | (a)  |   | furnish information with respect to Maple and
its Subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal for a period
of review not to exceed the Restricted Period; and/or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain
discussions or negotiations with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the
person making such Acquisition Proposal for a period of review not to exceed
the Restricted Period;  
   

  

       | _ _   | _ _   | _provided_ that Maple shall not, and shall
not allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such
person without having entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement
(a correct and complete copy of which confidentiality and standstill
agreement shall be provided to Parent before any such non-public information
is provided) with such person that contains provisions that are no less
favourable to Maple than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement,
provided that such confidentiality and standstill agreement may not include
any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with Maple and
may not restrict Maple or its Subsidiaries from complying with this Section
7.1, and Maple shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning Maple or its Subsidiaries provided to such other
person which was not previously provided to Parent.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (5)  |   | Maple shall ensure that its officers and
directors and those of its Subsidiaries and any financial or other advisors
or representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this Section
7.1, and it shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7.1 by any
such person or its advisors or representatives.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (6)  |   | Nothing contained in this Arrangement Agreement shall
prohibit the Board from making any disclosure to Maple Shareholders or from
calling and holding a meeting of Maple Shareholders, or any of them,
requisitioned by Maple Shareholders, or any of them, in each case prior to
the Effective Date if required under applicable Laws.  
   

  

     7.2  |   | _Right to Match_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Subject to Section 7.2(2), Maple covenants that
it will not accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement in respect
of an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill
agreement permitted by Section 7.1(4)) nor withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent the
approval or recommendation of the Arrangement, nor accept, approve
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | an Acquisition Proposal has been made that the
Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Maple has complied with its obligations under Section
7.1 and the other provisions of this Article 7;  
      
    | (c)  |   | Maple has provided Parent with a notice in writing that
there is a Superior Proposal and confirmation that the Board has determined
that the proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal together with all
documentation comprising the Superior Proposal, including any value
(including a range of value, if any) in  ##### 

 

 

48  

     

  

       |   |   | financial terms that the Board has in consultation
with its financial advisors determined should be ascribed to any non-cash
consideration offered under the Superior Proposal;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (d)  |   | a period (the "Response Period") of five Business
Days shall have elapsed from the date on which Parent received the entirety
of the documentation set forth in the prior paragraph, and, if Parent has
proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement in accordance with Section
7.2(2), the Board shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal compared to the terms of the Arrangement
after giving effect to any offer to amend the terms of the Arrangement made
by Parent in accordance with Section 7.2(2);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | Maple terminates this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(1)(e); and  
      
    | (f)  |   | Maple has previously, or concurrently will have, paid
to Parent the Termination Fee.  
   

  

       | (2)  |   | During the Response Period, Parent will have the
right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the
Arrangement, and Maple shall co-operate with Parent with respect thereto,
including negotiating in good faith with Parent to enable Parent to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Arrangement Agreement and the
Arrangement as Parent deems appropriate and as would enable Parent to proceed
with the Arrangement and any related transactions on such adjusted terms. The
Board will review in good faith, in consultation with its financial and
external counsel, any such offer by Parent to amend the terms of the
Arrangement, including an increase in, or modification of, the consideration
to be received by the Maple Shareholders, to determine whether the
Acquisition Proposal to which Parent is responding would be a Superior
Proposal when assessed against the Arrangement as Parent has offered to
amend it. If the Board does not so determine, the Board will promptly
reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement and enter into an amended
Arrangement Agreement with Parent reflecting Parents offer to amend the
terms of the Arrangement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (3)  |   | If Maple provides Parent with notice under Section
7.2(1) on a date that is less than five Business Days before the date of the
Special Meeting, subject to applicable Laws, Maple shall postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting to a date that is after the Response Period but not more
than seven Business Days after the scheduled date of the Special Meeting.  
      
    | (4)  |   | Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
that results in an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or
value of such consideration) to be received by the holders of Maple Shares
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section
7.2 and Parent shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each
such Acquisition Proposal.  ##### 

 

 

49  

     

  

     7.3  |   | _Agreement as to Damages_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision relating to the payment of fees, including the payment of brokerage fees, if after the execution of this Arrangement Agreement the Arrangement is not consummated because: 

  

       | (1)  |   | Parent shall have terminated this Arrangement
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(d);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | (i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made or proposed to Maple or to the Maple Shareholders after the date hereof
and prior to the Special Meeting; (ii) this Arrangement Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(a)(iii); and (iii) within nine months
of the date of this Arrangement Agreement an Acquisition Proposal is
completed (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (i) above); provided, however,
that for purposes of clause 7.3(2)(iii), the term "Acquisition Proposal"
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except that
references to "material sale" shall be deemed to be references to "sale of
50% or more" and reference to "securities" shall be deemed to be reference to
"outstanding securities";  
      
    | (3)  |   | Parent shall have terminated this Arrangement Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(b) in the event of any wilful or intentional
breach by Maple of any of its obligations under this Arrangement Agreement;
or  
      
    | (4)  |   | Maple shall have terminated this Arrangement Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(e),  
   

 

then Maple shall pay to Parent, within two Business Days of the first to occur
of (1), (2) or (3) above (or, in the case of (4) above, contemporaneously or
prior to such termination), the amount of $10,200,000 (the "Termination Fee")
as liquidated damages in immediately available funds to an account designated
by Parent. For greater certainty, the Parties acknowledge that Maple shall
not be obligated to make more than one payment pursuant to this Section
7.3. 

   

 Each Party acknowledges that the payment amount set out in this Section 7.3 is a payment of liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the aggregate damages which Parent and Acquisition Sub will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this Arrangement Agreement and is not a penalty. Maple irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to Article 8, payment of the amount determined pursuant to this Section 7.3 in the manner provided in respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub collectively under this Arrangement Agreement, provided however, that payment by Maple and acceptance by Parent of the amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.3 shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy available in the event of any wilful or intentional breach by Maple of any of its obligations under this Arrangement Agreement. 

  

     7.4  |   | _Fees and Expenses_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4) and
Section 5.5, each Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
such Party in connection with this Arrangement Agreement and the
Arrangement.  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

50  

     

  

       | (2)  |   | If this Arrangement Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to (i) Section 8.2(1)(a)(iii) or (ii) Section 8.2(1)(b) based
on any condition contained in Section 6.2(1) or (2) not having been satisfied
or waived by Parent at or before the Effective Date, then (in each case
unless the Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have made a misrepresentation or
breached a warranty or covenant under this Arrangement Agreement in such a
manner that Maple would be entitled to rely on the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.3 as a reason not to complete the Arrangement and
terminate this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(c)), Maple
shall pay Parent $750,000 as reimbursement to Parent and Acquisition Sub for
their aggregate out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (3)  |   | If this Arrangement Agreement is terminated by Maple
pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(c) based on any condition contained in Section 6.3
not having been satisfied or waived by Maple at or before the Effective Date,
then (unless Maple shall have made a misrepresentation or breached a warranty
or covenant under this Arrangement Agreement in such a manner that Parent
would be entitled to terminate this Arrangement Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(1)(b)), Parent shall pay Maple $750,000 as reimbursement to Maple for its
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.  
      
    | (4)  |   | No fees shall be payable by Maple under subsection (2)
if Maple has paid the amount provided under Section 7.3.  
      
    | (5)  |   | Subject to Sections 5.5, Parent shall be responsible
for any filing fees made in support of any filings made to a Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Arrangement
Agreement.  
      
    | (6)  |   | Payments of any amounts under subsection (2) (in the
case only of terminations pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(b)), or subsection (3)
shall not be exclusive of any other remedies to which the Parties may be
entitled as a result of the termination of this Arrangement Agreement.  
   

  

     7.5  |   | _Access to Information; Confidentiality_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

 From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Arrangement Agreement, Maple shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, agents and representatives of Parent such access as Parent may reasonably require at all reasonable times, including for the purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall furnish Parent with all data and information as Parent may reasonably request. The Parties acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

     7.6  |   | _Insurance and Indemnification_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Parent and Maple agree that Maple shall maintain
in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six years after the
Effective Date customary policies of directors and officers liability
insurance providing protection not less favourable than the  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

51  

     

  

       |   |   | protection provided by the policies maintained by
Maple and its Subsidiaries as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carriers with respect to directors
and officers insurance for all present and former directors and officers of
Maple and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent, Maple
and any of their respective Subsidiaries shall not be required to pay, in
the aggregate, a premium for such insurance in excess of $234,425 but, in
such case, shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such
amount.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and
directors of Maple and its Subsidiaries that are disclosed in Section 3.1(bb)
of the Disclosure Letter shall survive the completion of the Arrangement and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Date.  
      
    | (3)  |   | Parent shall cause Maple and its Subsidiaries to
forthwith following the Effective Date to make all necessary and appropriate
filings to reflect the resignation of the current directors of Timber other
than Brian Doody from their positions as directors and officers of Maple and
its Subsidiaries as applicable.  
   

  

     7.7  |   | _Certain Employee Matters_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Subject to Section 3.1(k)(x) and (xi), each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (i) acknowledges that the announcement or completion of the Arrangement or other aspects of the transactions contemplated by this Arrangement Agreement results in change of control or other payment triggering events, or may permit or require adjustments, under certain of the Companys incentive plans and employment and other agreements, as referenced in Section 7.7 of the Disclosure Letter, and (ii) covenants that upon and following the completion of the Arrangement, shall cause the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honour and perform its obligations thereunder, including by paying to the individuals granted benefits under such plans or party to such agreements, in each case, such amounts as referenced in Section 7.7 of the Disclosure Letter. Timber acknowledges and agrees that Maple will forego any deduction under the Tax Act with respect to the cash payment to be made by Maple to holders of Maple Options pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and, in that regard, Maple will comply with the requirements described in subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act. 

  

     7.8  |   | _Maple Name and Locations_   
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Subject to Section 7.8(3), Parent agrees, for a
period of five years following the Effective Date, to cause the name "DALSA"
to be included as part of the corporate and business names of Maple or its
successors, failing which Maple or its successor shall forthwith make a
donation in the amount of $2,000,000 to the University of Waterloo for the
purpose of establishing an endowment to fund a Chair in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering Department of the University of Waterloo or, if for any
reason such endowment cannot be established, for the general use of the
University of Waterloo.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (2)  |   | Subject to Section 7.8(3), Parent agrees, for a
period of five years following the Effective Date, to cause Maple or its
successors to maintain its locations in Waterloo, Ontario and Bromont, Quebec
as continuing operations, failing which Maple or its successor  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

52  

     

  

       |   |   | company to Maple shall forthwith make a donation in
the amount of $2,000,000 to University of Waterloo for the purpose of
establishing an endowment to fund a Chair in the Electrical and Computer
Engineering Department of the University of Waterloo or, if for any reason
such endowment cannot be established, for the general use of the University
of Waterloo.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (3)  |   | Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 7.8(1) and
7.8(2), in no event shall Parent be required to make a payment under both of
Sections 7.8(1) and 7.8(2), and Parents payment obligation under Sections
7.8(1) and 7.8(2) shall not exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate.  
      
    | (4)  |   | Parent hereby establishes a trust and settles upon it
the rights and benefits of the covenants of Parent in Sections 7.8(1) and
7.8(2), and appoints the Trustees as trustees of such trust to hold the
benefit of an enforce performance of such rights and benefits, such trust and
appointment to be effective at the Effective time, the Parent acknowledging
receipt from the Trustees of their acceptance of their appointments and the
trust created by this Section 7.8(3) and their agreement to hold such rights
and benefits in trust for the use and benefit of the University of
Waterloo.  
      
    | (5)  |   | Each Party acknowledges that the payment amounts set
out in this Section 7.8 represent a payment of liquidated damages which is a
genuine pre-estimate of the aggregate damages which Maple will suffer or
incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant
termination of this Arrangement Agreement and are not a penalty.

not satisfied;

terminate this Arrangement Agreement under this Section 8.2(1)(a)(ii) shall
not be available to any Party whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Arrangement to occur on
or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Arrangement Agreement; or  #####

qualified or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation of the

taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal beyond a period of ten Business Days after public announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), (ii) the
Board or the Special Committee shall have approved or recommended any
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) Maple shall have breached Section 7.1 in any
material respect (provided, however, that, if the nature of such breach is
capable of being cured, Parent may only terminate this Arrangement Agreement
pursuant to this clause (iii) if Maple shall not have cured such breach
within one Business Day from the date of the breach giving rise to the
termination right); or (iv) Parent requests that the Board reaffirm its
recommendation of the Arrangement and this Arrangement Agreement and the
Board shall not have done so by the tenth Business Day following receipt of

written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (other than a
confidentiality and standstill agreement permitted by Section 7.1(4)),
subject to compliance with Sections 7.1 and 7.2 in all material respects and
provided that no termination under this Section 8.2(1)(e) shall be effective
unless and until Maple shall have paid to Parent the amount required to be
paid pursuant to Section 7.3;

stated otherwise.

       | (2)  |   | If this Arrangement Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2, this

such Shareholders who: (i) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be
paid fair value for their Shares shall be deemed to have transferred their
Shares to Acquisition Sub in exchange for a debt claim against Acquisition
Sub to be paid the fair value of such Shares pursuant to the
Dissent Procedures, and will not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement in respect of such Shares had such Shareholders not exercised
their Dissent Rights; or (ii) are ultimately determined not to be entitled,
for any reason, to be paid fair value for their Shares, shall be deemed to
have participated in the Arrangement as of the Effective Time on the
same basis as a non-Dissenting Shareholder and shall receive cash
consideration in respect of their Shares as if such Shares would not have
exercised Dissent Rights.  
      
    | (3)  |   | In no case shall the Company, the Acquisition Sub, the
Depository, the registrar and transfer agent of the Shares or any other
person be required to recognize a Dissenting Shareholder as a holder of
Shares after the Effective Time and the name of each Dissenting Shareholder
shall be removed from the registers of holders of Shares as at the Effective
Time as provided in Article 2.

of the OBCA, none of the following shall be entitled to exercise Dissent
Rights: (i) Optionholders, (ii) holders of DSUs and (iii) Shareholders who
vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution.  #####

When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to whom cash is to be paid shall, as a condition precedent to such payment, give a bond satisfactory to Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Depository in such sum as Parent and the Depository may direct, or otherwise indemnify the Depository, Parent and Acquisition Sub in a manner satisfactory to each of them against any claim that may be made against the Depository, Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and shall otherwise take such action as may be required by the by-laws of the Company or the Holdco, as applicable.

 Maple represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

corporation duly amalgamated and validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of Ontario and has all corporate power and authority to own and
operate its assets and properties as now owned and to carry on its business
as now conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly registered
or otherwise authorized to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties, whether owned, leased,
licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of its activities makes
such registration necessary, and has all governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals the absence of which do not have and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Corporate Records. Except as set out in Section 3.1(b)
of the Disclosure Letter, the corporate minute books of the Company and each

execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Arrangement
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement has been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the Arrangement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than

approval by  ##### 

 

 

C-2  

     |   |   | the Maple Shareholders in the manner required by the
Interim Order and applicable Laws and approval by the Court. The Arrangement
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other Laws of general application relating to
or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including

unanimously (i) approved the Arrangement and the other transactions
contemplated herein and authorized the entering into of this Arrangement
Agreement, the execution hereof, and the performance of the provisions hereof
by the Company; (ii) determined, based in part on the Fairness Opinion, that
the Arrangement is fair to the Maple Shareholders and that the Arrangement is
in the best interest of the Company; and (iii) recommended that the Maple
Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution. Each member of the
Board has indicated his or her intention to vote all of his or her Maple
Shares in favour of the Arrangement Resolution and has agreed that the press
release to be issued by the Company announcing the Arrangement may reference
such statement of intention and that references to such intention may be made
in the Information Circular.

     | (d)  |   | Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of the Arrangement Agreement and the

required by the Interim Order; (ii) the Final Order; (iii) filings with the
Director under the OBCA; (iv) the Regulatory Approvals; and (v) compliance
with any applicable Securities Laws, stock exchange rules and policies.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of its obligations under the Arrangement Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement
Agreement and by the Plan of Arrangement do not and shall not: (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the articles or by-laws of the Company or the
constating documents of any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters, or obtaining the approvals, referred to in paragraph (d)
above, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any applicable Law or any license, approval, consent or
authorization issued by a Governmental Entity held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; (iii) except for the Contracts set out in Schedule 3.1(e)
of the Disclosure Letter, require any notice or consent or other action by
any person under, contravene, conflict with, violate, breach or constitute a
default or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,

cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under, create any liability of obligation of the Company or any
Subsidiaries, or give rise to any rights of first refusal or trigger
any change in control provisions or any restriction under, any provision of

any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as do not have
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Following the consummation of the
Arrangement in accordance with its terms, none of Parent or Acquisition Sub
will have any obligation to make any payment to any person with respect to
the purchase of any Maple Shares, Maple Options or DSUs except
as contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement.

and except as set forth in Section 3.1(bb) of the Disclosure Letter, to the
knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Material Contract is in

any restriction upon the incurrence of Financial Indebtedness by Maple or
any of its Subsidiaries or restricts the ability of Maple or any of its

indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party has
become repayable before its stated maturity date, nor has any security in
respect of such indebtedness become enforceable, by reason of default by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no event has occurred or is, to the
knowledge of the Company, impending which, with the lapse of time or the
fulfillment of any condition or the giving of notice or the compliance with
any other formality may result in any such indebtedness becoming so repayable
before its stated maturity date or any such security becoming
enforceable and, so far as the Company is aware, no person to whom any
indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is owed which is
repayable on demand has demanded or threatened to demand repayment of, or to
take any steps to enforce any security for the same, in each case which would
have or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
