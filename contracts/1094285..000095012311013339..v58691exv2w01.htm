Pre-Acquisition Reorganization that might be undertaken and the manner in which they
might most effectively be undertaken; provided, however, that any Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization: (i)&nbsp;will not require Maple to obtain the prior approval of the Maple
Shareholders in respect of such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization other than at the
Special Meeting; (ii)&nbsp;is not prejudicial to Maple securityholders in that it will not
result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other consequences to, any
securityholder of Maple incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to
such party in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement in the absence of any
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization; (iii)&nbsp;will not impede or materially delay the
completion of the Arrangement; (iv)&nbsp;will not result in the withdrawal or material
modification of the Fairness Opinion; and (v)&nbsp;cannot either be completed immediately
prior to or contemporaneously with the Effective Time, or cannot be reversed or unwound
without adversely affecting the Company, its Subsidiaries or the securityholders of
Maple. Parent shall provide written notice to Maple of any proposed Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization at least ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time. Upon receipt of
such notice, Parent and Maple shall, if Maple is required to do so pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, work co-operatively and use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do all
such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization at least two Business Days prior to the Effective Time, or such later
time as may be agreed to by Parent. In addition:</TD>

liquidated damages which is a genuine pre-estimate of the aggregate damages which Parent and
Acquisition Sub will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the
resultant termination of this Arrangement Agreement and is not a penalty. Maple irrevocably waives
any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to Article&nbsp;8, payment of the
amount determined pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.3 in the manner provided in respect thereof is the
sole monetary remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub collectively under this Arrangement Agreement,
provided however, that payment by Maple and acceptance by Parent of the amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.3 shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment or remedy
available in the event of any wilful or intentional breach by Maple of any of its obligations under
this Arrangement Agreement.

are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and

Subsidiaries; and (iii)&nbsp;are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
