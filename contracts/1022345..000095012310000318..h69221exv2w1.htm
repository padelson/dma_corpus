 TITLE MATTERS 

   

10.1 _Title Defect Notice_. 

    

 (a) At any time on or prior to the Defect Notification Deadline, Buyer may provide Seller with one or more written notices (each, a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") of any fact that renders a Subs title to any Lease, Well or Fee Interest less than Good and Defensible Title (each, a " _Title Defect_ "). Each Title Defect Notice shall include, in reasonable detail, a description of (i) the Lease, Well or Fee Interest with respect to which any Title Defect(s) has been identified, (ii) the nature of each such Title Defect(s) and all supporting documents necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defects, and (iii) Buyers commercially reasonable good faith estimate of the Defect Value for each such Title Defect calculated in accordance with the guidelines set forth in _Sections 10.3.1_   _10.3.6_ and the Allocated Value of the Lease, Well or Fee Interest. 

   

 (b) Any Title Defect that is not identified in a timely delivered Title Defect Notice shall thereafter be forever waived and expressly assumed by Buyer and shall be deemed to have become a Permitted Encumbrance. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the following matters shall constitute a Title Defect in the event of a change in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest with respect to the Wells, Leases and Fee Interests as set forth in _Exhibit B_ after the date hereof: (1) a change in drilling units, spacing or pooling units, or tract allocations or changes in participating areas, or integration orders occurring after the date hereof, (2) an after-payout change in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest pursuant to a farmout, farmin, consent election, nonconsent election, integration order or other Contract or event if the effect of such change is set forth in _Exhibit B-1_; (3) defects based on failure to record Leases issued by any state, or any assignments of record title or operating rights in such Leases, in the real property, conveyance or other records of the county or parish in which such Property is located; (4) defects that have been cured by Applicable Laws of limitations or prescription; (5) any delay in delivering an assignment earned under a farmout, participation or similar agreement unless it is determined that the farmout party or other third party record title holder has refused to deliver such assignment; and (6) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status or omissions of successors or heirship proceedings, unless it is determined that such failure or omission has resulted in a third partys actual and superior claim of title to the Property. 

   ##### 

  

  

10.2 _Determination of Title Defects and Defect Values_. 

    

 10.2.1. Within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of a Title Defect Notice, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing if Seller disagrees with the Title Defects claimed therein and/or the Defect Values set forth therein. If Seller fails to provide written objection(s) within such ten (10) Business Day period, Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with such Title Defects and Defect Values and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Defect Values as set forth in _Article IV_. If Seller provides written notice of any disagreement with respect to any such claimed Title Defect and/or Defect Values, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations for ten (10) days, and shall attempt to agree in writing on such matters. If Seller and Buyer reach written agreement, the value agreed by such parties shall be the Defect Values for such Title Defects and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to such agreed Defect Values as set forth in _Article IV_. 

   

 10.2.2. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement concerning either the existence of a Title Defect or the Defect Value within ten (10) days after Sellers notice to Buyer of any disagreement with respect to any claimed Title Defects and/or Defect Value, then such parties shall submit such dispute to a mutually acceptable attorney licensed to practice law in the state in which such Lease, Well or Fee Interest is located and having at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas title matters for prompt resolution; provided, however, that if at any time any attorney so chosen fails or refuses to perform hereunder, a new attorney shall be chosen by Seller and Buyer. In the event Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon such mutually acceptable attorney within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of such written request, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that the attorney shall be selected by the Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law or the next most Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law in the event the most Senior Chaired Professor is unable or unwilling to serve. The cost of any such attorney shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. For any such dispute resolution process, Seller and Buyer shall present a written statement of their respective positions on the dispute to the attorney within three (3) Business Days after the selection of the attorney is confirmed pursuant to the terms hereof, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such statements the attorney shall make a determination of all points of disagreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the attorney shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and shall be enforceable against either Seller or Buyer in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the value, if any, determined by the attorney with respect to a Title Defect shall be the Defect Value for such Title Defect. If necessary to complete such determination, the Closing Date shall be deferred until the attorney has made a determination of the disputed issues with respect thereto and all subsequent dates and required activities having reference to the Closing Date shall be correspondingly deferred; provided, however, that unless the parties mutually agree to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not be deferred pursuant to this _Section 10.2.2_ for more than ten (10) Business Days. 

   

 10.2.3. If the determination has not been made by the attorney by the Closing Date, the procedures set forth in _Section 10.5.3_ shall govern. 

   ##### 

  

   

 10.2.4. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, in the event that any Title Defect is not waived in writing by Buyer, or cured on or before the Closing Date to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, then Seller and Buyer hereby agree that Seller shall cause the applicable Sub to assign to Seller the affected Lease, Well and/or Fee Interest, as applicable, to which the Title Defect relates or pertains (the " _Affected Property_ "), in which case the Affected Property shall, subject as hereinafter provided, be deleted from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Affected Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Title Defect affecting the Affected Property is cured within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, and Seller gives notice to Buyer of its election within such time period, Seller shall have the right to sell and reassign the Affected Property to the applicable Sub by executing and delivering to the applicable Sub a recordable reassignment of such Affected Property substantially in the form of the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Assignment_ "), with the required revisions and necessary changes, and Buyer hereby agrees that it shall cause the applicable Sub to purchase and accept the reassignment of the Affected Property for the Allocated Value thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as if the Affected Property had not been assigned from the applicable Sub to the Seller. Seller shall receive the Allocated Value for such Affected Property simultaneously with the reassignment thereof to the applicable Sub. 

  

10.3 _Calculation of Defect Value_. 

    

 10.3.1. If, because of the Title Defect, title to a particular Lease, Well or Fee Interest fails completely with the effect that the respective Sub has no ownership interest in the relevant Lease, Well or Fee Interest, the Defect Value shall be the Allocated Value of such Lease, Well or Fee Interest. 

   

 10.3.2. If a Title Defect exists because a Sub owns a Net Revenue Interest in a Lease, Well or Fee Interest that is less than the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest as set forth on _Exhibit B_, then the Defect Value with respect to such Title Defect shall be the amount equal to the product of (i) the Allocated Value for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between (x) the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_ minus (y) the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest agreed or determined to be owned by such Sub and the denominator of which is the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set forth on  _Exhibit B_. 

   

 10.3.3. If a Title Defect that is not specifically extinguished by the Confirmation Order is a Lien upon a Lease, Well or Fee Interest then Seller shall either (a) instruct Buyer to pay at Closing out of the Purchase Price the sum necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the Title Defect from such Lease, Well or Fee Interest (the aggregate of all such amounts, the " _Liquidated Title Defect Payment_ "), or (b) retain the obligation of such Title Defect and elect to challenge the validity thereof (or of any portion thereof), in which case Buyer shall extend reasonable cooperation to Seller in such efforts at no risk or expense to Buyer; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is not cured by three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, it shall constitute a Title Defect. 

   ##### 

  

   

 10.3.4. If a Title Defect represents an obligation or burden upon a Lease, Well or Fee Interest for which the economic detriment to Buyer is not liquidated but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the Defect Value with respect to such Title Defect shall be the sum Seller and Buyer mutually agree upon in writing in good faith as the present value of the adverse economic effect such Title Defect will have on such Lease, Well or Fee Interest. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach such written agreement as to such Defect Value, then such dispute shall be resolved in the manner set forth in _Section 10.2_. 

   

 10.3.5. The Defect Value shall take into consideration all of the applicable guidelines as are set forth in _Sections 10.3.1_, _10.3.2_ , _10.3.3_ and  _10.3.4_ above. 

   

 10.3.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for individual Title Defects that have a Defect Value that does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$100,000) (" _Individual Title Deductible_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for all Title Defects unless the sum of the Defect Values with respect to all such Title Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller, exceeds a threshold equal to One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$1,500,000) (" _Aggregate Title Deductible_ "), after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies equal to the sum of Defect Values with respect to Title Defects that exceed the Aggregate Title Deductible. 

 

10.4 _Title Benefit Notice_. At any time prior to the Defect Notification
Deadline, Seller may provide Buyer with one or more written notices (each, a
" _Title Benefit Notice_ ") if Seller believes that a Sub owns a greater Net
Revenue Interest in any Lease, Well or Fee Interest than as set forth in
_Exhibit B_ for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable (a " _Title
Benefit_ "); provided, however, that for any Property subject to an alleged
Title Defect, Seller may deliver a Title Benefit Notice at any time prior to
two days prior to the Auction. Each Title Benefit Notice shall include, in
reasonable detail, a description of (a) the Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as
applicable, with respect to which any Title Benefit(s) has been identified,
(b) the nature of each such Title Benefit(s) and all supporting documents
necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of the alleged Title Benefit and
(c) Sellers commercially reasonable good faith estimate of the value for
each such Title Benefit (the " _Benefit Values_ ") calculated in accordance
with the guidelines set forth in _Section 10.6_. 

  

10.5 _Determination of Title Benefits and Benefit Values_. 

    

 10.5.1. Within ten (10) days after Buyers receipt of a Title Benefit Notice, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing if Buyer disagrees with the Title Benefits claimed therein and/or the Benefit Values set forth therein. If Buyer fails to provide written objection(s) within such ten (10) day period, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with such Title Benefits and Benefit Values and such Benefit Values will be credited as an offset against any Defect Values for Title Defects, if any, with the remaining Benefit Value after offset being an increase to the Purchase Prices as set forth in _Article IV_. If Buyer provides written notice of any disagreement with respect to any such claimed Title Benefit and/or Benefit Values, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly enter into good faith 

   ##### 

  

   

negotiations for ten (10) days and shall attempt to agree in writing on such
matters. If Seller and Buyer reach written agreement, the value agreed by
Seller and Buyer shall be the Benefit Values for such Title Benefits and will
be credited as an offset against any Defect Values for Title Defects, if any,
with the remaining Benefit Value after offset being an increase to the
Purchase Price as set forth in _Article IV_. 

   

 10.5.2. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach written agreement concerning either the existence of a Title Benefit or the Benefit Value within ten (10) days after Buyers notice of any disagreement with respect to any claimed Title Benefits and/or Benefit Value, then Seller and Buyer shall submit such dispute to a mutually acceptable attorney licensed to practice law in the state in which such Lease, Well or Fee Interest is located and having at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas title matters for prompt resolution; provided, however, that if at any time any attorney so chosen fails or refuses to perform hereunder, a new attorney shall be chosen by Seller and Buyer. In the event Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon such mutually acceptable attorney within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of such written request, Seller and Buyer hereby agree that the attorney shall be selected by the Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law or the next most Senior Chaired Professor of Oil and Gas Law at the University of Texas School of Law in the event the most Senior Chaired Professor is unable or unwilling to serve. The cost of any such attorney shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. For any such dispute resolution process, Buyer and Seller shall present a written statement of their respective positions on the dispute to the attorney within three (3) Business Days after the attorney is selected pursuant to the terms hereof, and within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such statements the attorney shall make a determination of all points of disagreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the attorney shall be conclusive and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable against either Seller or Buyer in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the value determined by the attorney with respect to a Title Benefit shall be the Benefit Value for such Title Benefit. 

   

 10.5.3. If the attorney does not make a determination of the disputed issues prior to the Closing Date, the Closing will proceed and such determination shall be made by such attorney after the Closing Date and prior to the determination of the Final Purchase Price unless the amount in dispute with respect to the matters set forth in this _Article X_ would meet the threshold for a termination right of either Seller or Buyer as set forth in  _Section 17.1.5_, in which case the Closing Date shall be deferred and all subsequent dates and required activities having reference to the Closing Date shall be correspondingly deferred; provided, however, that unless the parties mutually agree to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not be deferred pursuant to this _Section 10.5.3_ for more than ten (10) Business Days, and the Agreement may thereafter be terminated pursuant to _Section 17.1.5_. 

 

10.6 _Calculation of Benefit Value_. If a Title Benefit exists because a Sub
owns a NRI in a Lease, Well or Fee Interest that is greater than the NRI for
such Lease, Well or Fee Interest as set forth on _Exhibit B_, then the
Benefit Value with respect to such Title Benefit shall be the amount equal to
the product of (i) the Allocated Value for such Lease, Well or Fee
Interest multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
difference between (x) the NRI for such Lease, Well 

      ##### 

  

    

or Fee Interest agreed or determined to be owned by such Sub minus (y) the NRI
for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set forth on _Exhibit B_ and the
denominator of which is the NRI for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest set
forth on _Exhibit B_. The Benefit Value for a Title Benefit shall be subject
to the Individual Title Deductible and Aggregate Title Deductible. 

  

10.7 _Affected Seller Properties_. Seller hereby agrees that it shall, prior
to the Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent to assign, if required, the Affected Seller Property, if any, to the
appropriate Sub, and if obtained or not required, to execute and deliver to
the appropriate Sub a recordable assignment of each Affected Seller
Property substantially in the form of the Assignment with the required
revisions and necessary changes. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof
to the contrary, if consent to assign is required and cannot be obtained
prior to the Closing, Seller shall, if requested by Buyer in writing, retain
the applicable Affected Seller Property and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value ascribed to such Affected
Seller Property; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event Seller obtains
such consent to assign within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, Seller
shall execute and deliver to the appropriate Sub a recordable assignment of
such Affected Seller Property substantially in the form of the Assignment
with the required revisions and necessary changes, and Buyer hereby agrees
that it shall cause the appropriate Sub to receive such assignment and to
pay to Seller simultaneously with such receipt an amount equal to the
Allocated Value for such Affected Seller Property. 

  

10.8 _Post-Closing Title Determination_. Subject to the rights of Seller or
Buyer to terminate this Agreement provided for herein, in the event the title
attorneys determination of the disputed issues is not rendered within ten
(10) Business Days following the Closing Date pursuant to _Section 10.5.3_,
the Affected Property shall be deleted from this Agreement effective as of
Closing and the Purchase Price reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated
Value of such Affected Property. Promptly after the attorneys determination
of the Defect Value or Benefit Value for the Title Defect or Title Benefit,
the parties shall deliver such conveyances and reduce or increase the
Purchase Price in the Final Settlement Statement necessary to implement
the determination.

11.1 _Presence of Wastes, NORM, Hazardous Substances and Asbestos_. BUYER
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN USED TO EXPLORE FOR, DEVELOP AND
PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS, AND THAT SPILLS OF WASTES, CRUDE OIL, PRODUCED WATER,
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE OCCURRED THEREON.
ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, MAY CONTAIN

PURSUANT TO ITS PURCHASE OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS, BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO
CAUSE THE SUBS TO ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR THE ASSESSMENT, REMEDIATION,
REMOVAL, TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND ASSOCIATED
ACTIVITIES. 

   

11.2 _Environmental Assessment_. 

    

 (a) Subject as hereinafter provided, Buyer shall have the opportunity to conduct at its expense an environmental assessment of the Leases, Wells and Fee Interests, which may include invasive testing of the soil, groundwater, surface water, air and other environmental media and of building materials, equipment or facilities which would be conducted by a reasonable and prudent operator under the same or similar circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not conduct any such invasive testing prior to providing Seller with a written description of the proposed invasive testing and a reasonable period of time to provide comments, which Buyer agrees to consider in good faith. Seller or the respective Sub will provide reasonable access for this purpose to such Leases, Wells ands Fee Interests operated by such Sub. For any Wells not operated by a Sub, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer in contacting the operators of any such non-operated Wells directly to attempt to arrange for access for the purposes of environmental assessment. While performing any environmental assessment, Buyer and any of its Representatives shall comply with Sellers and the respective Subs environmental and safety rules and policies with respect to the Leases and Sub operated Wells, and with the operators environmental and safety rules and policies on all other Wells, and permit Seller to observe all aspects of each environmental assessment. Buyer shall be responsible, at its sole cost, risk and expense, for the management and disposal of any wastes generated during any environmental assessment in compliance with all Applicable Laws and for restoring the condition of any part of the Leases, Wells and Fee Interests that are disturbed as a result of any environmental assessment. 

   

 (b) Buyer will notify Seller in advance of any disclosure of the results of its environmental assessment to any Governmental Authority and will furnish Seller copies of all materials to be disclosed prior to any disclosure thereof and will not disclose any such information unless such disclosure is expressly required by Applicable Law or is required pursuant to legal process of any court or Governmental Authority subsequent to the exhaustion of all appeals. As soon as possible after Buyers receipt thereof, Buyer shall forward to Seller copies of all data and test results, and, if subject to an Adverse Environmental Condition Notice, of Buyers remediation cost estimates and recommended remediation procedures. Buyers remediation cost estimates and recommended remediation procedures shall be based upon the most economically reasonable response action, if any, required under Environmental Laws to bring the Adverse Environmental Condition into compliance with standards applicable to industrial 

   ##### 

  

   

properties under the same or similar circumstances, that does not
materially impair the existing business use of the Properties, assuming the
Leases, Wells and Fee Interests remain in operation as currently operated
(the " _Remediation Amount_ "). 

   

 (c) BUYER HEREBY AGREES TO RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS, AND DEFEND THE SELLER GROUP FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND LOSSES INCURRED OR SUFFERED BY THE SELLER GROUP, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY: (I) FROM DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTIES AND ANY OTHER PROPERTY AND PHYSICAL INJURY AND DEATH TO PERSONS IN CONNECTION WITH, OR ARISING OUT OF, OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO, BUYERS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, AND (II) AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH BY BUYER OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS  _SECTION 11.2_. 

 

11.3 _Notice of Adverse Environmental Conditions_. At any time on or prior to
the Defect Notification Deadline, Buyer may provide Seller with one or more
written notices (each, an " _Adverse Environmental Condition Notice_ ") of
the existence of one or more Adverse Environmental Conditions at or relating
to any Lease, Well or Fee Interest. Each Adverse Environmental Condition
Notice shall include, in reasonable detail, a description of (a) the
Lease, Well or Fee Interest with respect to which any such Adverse
Environmental Condition has been identified, (b) the nature of each such
Adverse Environmental Condition, (c) Buyers estimate of the Remediation
Amount (the " _Buyer Remediation Amount_ ") for each such Adverse
Environmental Condition and (d) Buyers commercially reasonable good faith
estimate of the Allocated Value of the Lease, Well or Fee Interest. In
preparing the Buyer Remediation Amount, Buyer shall apply economically
reasonable standards applicable to industrial locations, including risk-
based assessments, the execution, placement, and filing of engineering
controls, deed notices, institutional controls, and other cost-effective
remedial actions. Any Adverse Environmental Condition that is not identified
in a timely delivered Adverse Environmental Condition Notice shall, except to
the extent representing a breach of _Section 5.23_ thereafter be
forever waived and expressly assumed by Buyer. 

  

11.4 _Determination of Adverse Environmental Conditions and Remediation
Values_. 

    

 11.4.1. Within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of an Adverse Environmental Condition Notice, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing if Seller disagrees with any Adverse Environmental Condition or Buyer Remediation Amount set forth therein. If Seller fails to provide such notice, (a) Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with such Adverse Environmental Condition, and such Buyer Remediation Amount set forth with respect to the relevant Adverse Environmental Condition, and the Buyer Remediation Amount shall become the "Final Remediation Amount" for such Adverse Environmental Condition, and (b) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Final Remediation Amount as set forth in _Section 4.2.5_. If Seller provides such notice of disagreement, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly enter into good faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree in writing on the Remediation Amount, if any, with respect to each relevant Adverse Environmental Condition agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer (such 

   ##### 

  

   

agreed amount, the " _Agreed Remediation Amount_ " which shall become the
"Final Remediation Amount" for such Adverse Environmental Condition), and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by any such Final Remediation Amount as set
forth in _Section 4.2.5_. 

   

 11.4.2. If Seller and Buyer cannot reach agreement as to whether an Adverse Environmental Condition exists and/or as to the Remediation Amount for any Adverse Environmental Condition agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer, in each case within twenty (20) days after Sellers notice of its disagreement with an Adverse Environmental Condition Notice, then Buyer and Seller may agree to (a) elect to have the subject Lease, Well of Fee Interest (and any integrally related Facilities, as agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer) assigned from the applicable Sub to Seller, and removed from the list of Leases, Wells and Fee Interests in exchange for a reduction of the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Retained Properties; _provided, however_ , that the aggregate reduction in the Purchase Price for all Retained Properties, if any, shall be limited to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price; (b) permit Seller to fully remove, remediate and resolve such Adverse Environmental Condition, at Sellers sole cost, provided that, if feasible, Seller shall (i) complete such removal, remediation and resolution prior to Closing, and (ii) provide, at its sole cost, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, acting in a commercially reasonable good faith manner, that no Adverse Environmental Condition existed, or that the Adverse Environmental Condition that did exist has been fully removed, remediated and resolved; or, if neither of the preceding subsections (a) and (b) resolves the issues between Buyer and Seller; (c) submit the questions as to whether an Adverse Environmental Condition exists and, if so, the Remediation Amount for such Adverse Environmental Condition to the Bankruptcy Court for final resolution (if it determines that an Adverse Environmental Condition exists, its determination of the Remediation Amount therefor being the " _Bankruptcy Court Remediation Amount_ " which shall become the "Final Remediation Amount" for such Adverse Environmental Condition), in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such Final Remediation Amount for such Adverse Environmental Condition. If necessary, the calculation of the Final Remediation Amount shall be deferred unless the amount in dispute with respect to the matters set forth in this  _Article XI_ would meet the threshold for a termination right of Seller or Buyer, in which case the Closing Date shall be deferred and all subsequent dates and required activities having reference to the Closing Date shall be correspondingly deferred until the Bankruptcy Court has made a determination of the disputed issues with respect thereto; provided, however, that unless the parties mutually agree to the contrary, the Closing Date shall not be deferred pursuant to this _Section 11.4.2_ for more than ten (10) Business Days and the Agreement may thereafter be terminated pursuant to _Section 17.1.6_. 

   

 11.4.3. 

   

 (a) If Buyer and Seller agree in writing to permit Seller to remove, remediate and resolve any Adverse Environmental Condition prior to Closing pursuant to the terms of _Section 11.4.2_ above, and such actions cannot be accomplished prior to the Closing Date, Seller may notify Buyer of Sellers intention to diligently pursue and complete such actions within sixty (60) days of 

   ##### 

  

   

the Closing Date. In such event, Seller shall cause the affected Lease, Well
or Fee Interest, as applicable, to be assigned from the appropriate Sub to
Seller and such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable, shall be, as
hereinafter provided, Retained Properties on the Closing Date and the
Allocated Value of such Retained Properties shall be withheld from the
Preliminary Purchase Price otherwise payable by Buyer. 

   

 (i) If, within fifteen (15) days prior to the date the final settlement of the Purchase Price adjustment is completed pursuant to  _Section 14.1_ and within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, Seller has provided to Buyer evidence satisfactory to Buyer, acting in a commercially reasonable good faith manner, that the Adverse Environmental Condition has been fully removed, remediated and resolved, such Lease, Well or Fee Interest shall no longer be Retained Properties, and Seller shall assign to the applicable Sub, by an assignment in substantially the form of the Assignment, with the required revisions and necessary changes, the Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable, and Buyer hereby agrees to cause the applicable Sub to accept the assignment of such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, and to pay to the Seller the Allocated Value (concurrently with such assignment) for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest in accordance with this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) As to any Retained Properties still subject to Adverse Environmental Conditions, Buyer, at its option may (A) offer Seller an extension of the remediation period on such terms and conditions as Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to impose, and Seller may accept or reject such extension; (B) waive the relevant Adverse Environmental Condition, in which case such Lease, Well or Fee Interest shall no longer be Retained Properties, and Seller shall assign to the appropriate Sub by an assignment in substantially the form of the Assignment, with the required revisions and necessary changes, the Lease, Well or Fee Interest, as applicable and Buyer hereby agrees to cause the applicable Sub to accept the assignment of such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, and to pay to Seller the Allocated Value (concurrently with such assignment) for such Lease, Well or Fee Interest in accordance with this Agreement; or (C) eliminate the affected Lease, Well or Fee Interest from the application of this Agreement, and retain the previously withheld portion of the Preliminary Purchase Price related to such Lease, Well or Fee Interest, free and clear of any claim by Seller with respect thereto, and thereupon any and all rights of Buyer in or to such Lease, Well or Fee Interest shall terminate. 

   

 (b) During the post-Closing period specified in subsection (a) above (as the same may be extended) and through the date the affected Leases, Wells or Fee Interests are assigned and purchased hereunder, with respect to any such Leases, Wells or Fee Interests subject to Adverse Environmental Conditions that Seller is attempting to cure, Seller shall remain the record owner thereof and shall 

   ##### 

  

   

continue to conduct its operations thereof or with respect thereto pursuant
to the provisions of _Article VII_ and any other applicable provision of
this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE XII

12.1 _Suspense Funds_. Not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing,
Seller shall provide to Buyer an updated listing showing all funds from
production, if any, attributable to the Properties that are currently held in
suspense by Seller or any Sub (including those funds attributable to the
Properties owed to Working Interest owners and royalty owners), and
shall transfer or cause the transfer at Closing to a Sub designated by Buyer
all such Suspense Funds in Sellers possession relating to the Subs and such
Properties (with the balance of such proceeds to be paid over or otherwise
accounted for pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement contemplated by 
_Section 14.1_). AFTER SUCH TRANSFER, AND TO THE EXTENT SUSPENSE FUNDS ARE
EITHER DELIVERED TO BUYER AT CLOSING OR SUCH FUNDS REMAIN IN THE SUBS AT
CLOSING, THE SUBS RECEIVING SUCH FUNDS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPER
DISTRIBUTION OF ALL SUCH SUSPENSE FUNDS TO THE PARTIES LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO
THEM, AND HEREBY AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER
GROUP FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO SUCH SUBS RETENTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH SUSPENSE FUNDS. 

   

ARTICLE XIII

13.1 _The Closing_. (i) Provided that all conditions precedent to the
obligations of Seller and Buyer pursuant to Articles VIII and IX hereof have
been satisfied or waived and that the Confirmation Order has been entered,
the pre-closing of the purchase and sale of the Equity Interests (the " _Pre-
Closing_ ") shall be held on December 22, 2009 at the offices of Akin Gump

in  _Section_ _13.3_ , with all of such documentation to be dated effective
as of December 31, 2009 and to be held in escrow by Akin Gump (the "
_Escrowed Documents_ "), it being understood that such Escrowed Documents
provided by Seller are being made on the basis of information known as of the
Pre-Closing Date and may be noted as such on such Escrowed
Documents regardless of any later effective date. It is agreed that each of
the Escrowed Documents will contain a specific notation that the effective
date of such documents will be deemed to be automatically amended from
December 31, 2009 to the Closing Date if the Closing occurs on a date later
than December 31, 2009 and that Akin Gump shall be entitled to insert in place
of the December 31, 2009 date reflected on each of the Escrowed Documents
such later date if the Closing Date occurs later than December 31, 2009. The
parties agree that the Escrowed Documents will not be subject to later
revocation.

 (ii) In addition, on the Pre-Closing Date Buyer will deliver the Preliminary Purchase Price, less the amount of the Deposit, into an escrow account (such escrowed funds, the " _Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price_ ") and pursuant to an escrow agreement substantially in the form of the Escrow Agreement, as amended and delivered by Seller and Buyer to the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrowed Deposit (such amended Escrow Agreement, the "Amended Escrow Agreement") and with the exception that the escrow agreement with respect to the Preliminary Purchase Price (the "Preliminary Purchase Price Escrow Agreement") will provide that the only condition for the release of the Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price from escrow to an account designated by Seller (the " _Escrow Release Condition_ ") will be (i) the failure of Seller or Buyer to deliver a notice to the Escrow Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December 31, 2009 (with an email copy to counsel and a company representative for the other party, Steven A. Buxbaum ( _steven.buxbaum@haynesboone.com_ ) and Teresa G. Bushman (tbushman@mariner-energy.com) in the case of Buyer and David Elder (delder@akingump.com) and Gary Pittman (gpittman@edgepet.com) in the case of Seller) that the Confirmation Order is subject to a stay pending appeal, accompanied by a certified copy of the court order imposing the stay, and directing the Escrow Agent not to release the Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price and the Escrowed Deposit from escrow (the " _Notification_ ") or (ii) if Seller or Buyer delivers the Notification to the Escrow Agent by 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December 31, 2009, the delivery by Seller or Buyer to the Escrow Agent (with an email copy to counsel and a company representative for the other party, Steven A. Buxbaum ( _steven.buxbaum@haynesboone.com_ ) and Teresa G. Bushman ( _tbushman@mariner-energy.com_ ) in the case of Buyer and David Elder (delder@akingump.com) and Gary Pittman (gpittman@edgepet.com) in the case of Seller) of a notice that the Confirmation Order is no longer subject to a stay pending appeal and is in full force and effect, accompanied by a certified copy of the court order lifting the stay (the " _Amended Notification_ "). Seller and Buyer agree that they will deliver the Notification only if the Confirmation Order is stayed following the Pre-Closing Date and will deliver the Amended Notification only if such stay is lifted and the Confirmation Order is in full force and effect. In addition, on or prior to the Pre-Closing Date, the parties agree to amend the Escrow Agreement relating to the Deposit to provide that the only condition to the release of the Deposit to an account designated by Seller shall be identical to the Escrow Release Condition (such escrowed Deposit under such amended Escrow Agreement, the " _Escrowed Deposit_ "). The parties further agree that Seller shall additionally be entitled to interest, if any, which has accrued on the Escrowed Deposit and the Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price under the applicable escrow documents from the Pre-Closing Date through the Closing Date and that Seller shall be entitled to unilaterally (and the applicable escrow documents shall so provide) direct the Escrow Agent as to the investment of the Escrowed Deposit and the Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price from and after the Pre-Closing Date. The delivery by the Buyer and Seller of the Escrowed Documents to Akin Gump shall be deemed the acknowledgment and agreement of the parties that all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller and Buyer pursuant to Articles VIII and IX hereof have been satisfied or waived as of the Pre-Closing Date. 

  

 (iii) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Equity Interests pursuant to this Agreement (" _Closing_ ") shall be held on December 31, 2009 (the " _Scheduled Closing Date_ ") or such later date as provided below or as extended by the terms of this Agreement (the date upon which Closing actually occurs, the " _Closing Date_ "). Unless otherwise agreed, the Closing shall occur on the Scheduled Closing Date unless Seller or Buyer delivers the Notification to the Escrow Agent prior to 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December 31, 2009. In the event 

   ##### 

  

 

Notification is not delivered by 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December
31, 2009 as provided above (i) the Escrowed Documents (defined below) will be
automatically released to Seller and to Buyer, (ii) the Escrowed Preliminary
Purchase Price (defined below) will be automatically released to an account
or accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow Agent, (iii) the
Escrowed Deposit (defined below) will be automatically released to an account
or accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow Agent and (iv) all other
conditions to Closing shall be deemed to have been satisfied. In the event
Notification is delivered by 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December 31,
2009 as provided above, the Closing shall occur in the same manner as provided
in subsections (i) through (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence on the
date of the delivery by Seller or Buyer to the Escrow Agent (with an email
copy to counsel and a company representative for the other party, Steve
Buxbaum ( _steven.buxbaum@haynesboone.com_ ) and Teresa Bushman (
_tbushman@mariner-energy.com_ ) in the case of Buyer and David Elder
(delder@akingump.com) and Gary Pittman (gpittman@edgepet.com) in the case of
Seller) of the Amended Notification. It is further agreed that at the Closing
the Escrowed Documents will be deemed delivered to both Seller and Buyer with
no further action on behalf of any party or Akin Gump upon (i) the later of
(a) 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time on December 31, 2009 if Seller or Buyer
does not deliver the Notification to the Escrow Agent prior to such time and
(b) the delivery of the Amended Notification and (ii) the receipt by Seller
of the Escrowed Preliminary Purchase Price and the Escrowed Deposit, whether
or not such Escrowed Documents are physically delivered to Seller
and/or Buyer on the Closing Date, it being understood and agreed that both
Buyer and Seller may retain copies of the Escrowed Documents delivered on the
Pre-Closing Date for their records pending their physical receipt of the
original Escrowed Documents to which they are entitled. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of any Casualty Loss
or other event which could cause a loss to Seller pending the Closing, Seller
and Buyer agree that if the Closing occurs, their rights hereunder with
respect to any such event shall be determined as if the Closing had occurred
on December 22, 2009 such that Buyer shall bear any risk of such loss. The
parties acknowledge that the Closing is being delayed from December 22, 2009
to December 31, 2009 to accommodate the preference of the Buyer, and in the
event there is an inconsistency in the terms of this Agreement or other
unanticipated impact on the transactions contemplated hereby which relates to
any delay in the Closing the Buyer and Seller will interpret the provisions
hereof such that Seller shall be in no worse position as a result of such
delay. 

  

13.2 _Closing Statement_. Seller shall provide Buyer with a closing statement
reflecting its good faith estimation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted in
accordance with Article IV and GAAP (the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ ") at
least two (2) days prior to the Pre-Closing Date which closing statement, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be based on an estimate of the Preliminary
Purchase Price assuming the Closing occurs on December 31, 2009 (it being
understood that any final adjustments to the Purchase Price will ultimately
be determined based on the actual Closing Date). 

  

13.3 _Closing Deliveries_. At Closing the following events shall occur, each
event under the control of Seller or Buyer, as applicable, being a condition
precedent to the events under the control of the other, and each event being
deemed to have occurred simultaneously with the other events:

   ##### 

  

   

from the Person exercising such preferential right to purchase or right
of first offer; 

   

 (b) If a preferential purchase right or right of first offer with respect to any Property is triggered by the sale and purchase of the Equity Interests as contemplated hereby, and is exercised but not paid for by a third Person prior to the Closing, such Property shall not be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby, the Purchase Price shall not be reduced, and the respective Sub shall, as applicable, be entitled either to retain the Property or all proceeds ultimately received, if any, for such Property from the Person exercising such preferential right to purchase or right of first offer. 

   

 (c) At the Closing, no reduction of the Purchase Price paid at the Closing shall be made with respect to a Property burdened by a preferential purchase right or right of first offer that has not been exercised as of the Closing Date, if the time period for the exercise of such right has expired. If, for any reason, such preferential purchase right or right of first offer is successfully exercised by the holder thereof after the Closing, the applicable Sub shall be entitled to retain all proceeds paid for the Property by the holder of the relevant preferential purchase right or right of first offer, and Seller shall have no liability with respect to such affected Property and no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

ARTICLE XIV 
 POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS 

  

14.1 _Final Settlement Statement_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare, in accordance with this Agreement and with GAAP, a statement ("
_Final Settlement Statement_ "), a copy of which shall be delivered by Buyer
to Seller no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, setting forth
each adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price necessary to determine the
final Purchase Price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") and showing the
calculation of such adjustments in accordance with GAAP and _Article IV_.
Seller shall provide Buyer all assistance reasonably requested by Buyer that
may be useful and/or necessary for the preparation of the Final Settlement
Statement. Seller shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement to review such statement and to provide written notice
to Buyer of Sellers objection to any item on the statement. Sellers notice
shall identify the item(s) objected to and the reasons and support for the
objection(s). If Seller does not provide written objection(s) within such
sixty (60)-day period, the Final Settlement Statement (and the Final Purchase
Price reflected therein) shall be deemed correct and shall not be subject to
further adjustment. If Seller provides written objection(s) within such sixty
(60)-day period, the Final Settlement Statement (and the Final Purchase Price
therein) shall be deemed correct with respect to the items not objected to,
and Buyer and Seller shall meet to negotiate and resolve the objections
within fifteen (15) days of Buyers receipt of Sellers objections. If Seller
and Buyer agree in writing on all objections, the adjusted Final Settlement
Statement shall be deemed correct and shall not be subject to
further adjustment. Any items not agreed to at the end of the fifteen
(15)-day period may, upon either Sellers or Buyers written request, be
resolved in accordance with _Section 14.2_. 

       ##### 

  

    

14.2 _Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer cannot agree upon the Final Settlement
Statement, the dispute shall be promptly submitted to the Bankruptcy Court
for resolution. 

  

14.3 _Retention of Funds by Seller_. Seller shall retain from the Preliminary
Purchase Price sufficient funds in an amount reasonably calculated by Seller
to satisfy any and all payment obligations, if any, to Buyer under _Section
14.4_ (the " _Seller Retained Funds_ "). Seller shall maintain the Seller
Retained Funds on deposit in a separate, interest bearing, debtor in
possession bank account maintained in accordance with Orders of the Bankruptcy
Court and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of the United States
Trustee, until such time, if any, as payments are due to Buyer under _Section
14.4_. 

  

14.4 _Payment of Final Purchase Price_. If the Purchase Price shown on the
Final Settlement Statement is more than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer
shall pay such difference to Seller in immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement has been agreed

applicable. If the Purchase Price shown on the Final Settlement Statement is
less than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Seller shall pay such difference to
Buyer from the Seller Retained Funds in immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement has been
agreed in writing by Seller or Buyer or decided by the Bankruptcy Court, as
applicable. 

  

14.5 _Receipts Not Reflected in Purchase Price_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, any production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the
Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and any other
income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to the Properties which are
not reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase Price following the final
adjustment pursuant to _Section 14.1_ shall be treated as follows: 

    

 (a) all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to the Properties from and after the Effective Time shall be the sole property and entitlement of Buyer, and, to the extent received by Seller, Seller shall fully disclose, account for and remit the same promptly to Buyer; and 

   

 (b) all production of Hydrocarbons from or attributable to the Properties (and all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and all other income, proceeds and receipts earned with respect to the Properties prior to the Effective Time and all amounts referenced under _Section 4.2.1_ which are not paid until after the Closing Date shall be the sole property and entitlement of Seller, and, to the extent received by Buyer or a Sub, Buyer shall fully disclose, account for and remit the same promptly to Seller. 

  

14.6 _Receipt, Remittance and Assignment of Accounts Receivable_. 

    

 14.6.1. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause each Sub to, and each Sub hereby agrees to, receive the Subs A/R, the Severance Tax Abatement Amount and the New Mexico Withholding Tax Amount (collectively, the " _Accounts Receivable_ ") 

   ##### 

  

   

reflected in the books and records of each applicable Sub generally in
accordance with the billing and receipt practices presently applied by each
such Sub in the receipt of its Accounts Receivable. In connection with such
receipts by a Sub, if a payment is received from an account debtor who has
not designated the invoice being paid thereby, such payment will be applied
to the earliest invoice outstanding with respect to indebtedness of
such account debtor, except for those invoices which are subject to a dispute
to the extent of such dispute. 

   

 14.6.2. Buyer will, on or before the tenth (10) Business Day of each calendar month commencing with the second complete calendar month following the Closing Date, deliver to Seller a written report (" _Collection Report_ ") of the following information with respect to the Accounts Receivable:

 (b) The aggregate amount of cash received that relates to the Accounts Receivable during the period from the Closing Date through the date of each Collection Report. 

   

 14.6.3. If, after the Closing Date, any Sub or Buyer receives any remittance from any account debtors with respect to the Accounts Receivable, Buyer will cause the applicable Sub to, and such Sub hereby agrees to, endorse such remittance to the order of Seller and forward it to Seller upon receipt thereof. 

   

 14.6.4. In the event Seller receives any remittance from or on behalf of any account debtor with respect to accounts receivable arising from invoices issued by any Sub subsequent to the Closing for services rendered and/or Hydrocarbons sold subsequent to the Closing Date, Seller agrees to endorse such remittance to the order of the applicable Sub and forward it to such Sub immediately upon receipt thereof. 

 

14.7 _Expenses Not Reflected in Purchase Price_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, any expenses with respect to the Properties incurred prior
to or after the Effective Time, which are not reflected in the adjustments to
the Purchase Price following the final adjustment pursuant to _Section 14.1_
shall be treated as follows: 

    

 (a) all expenses with respect to the Properties incurred prior to the Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Seller and Seller shall promptly pay, or, if any Claims underlying such expenses are not discharged by the Confirmation Order and are paid by Buyer, promptly reimburse Buyer or such Sub for such amounts; and 

   

 (b) all expenses with respect to the Properties incurred after the Effective Time shall be the sole obligation of Buyer and Buyer shall promptly pay, or if paid by Seller, promptly reimburse Seller for such amounts. 

 

14.8 _No Duplicative Effect; Methodologies_. The provisions of _Article
IV_,  _Section 14.1_ and of any other transaction document executed in
connection with this Agreement and the Final Order 

      ##### 

  

    

shall apply in such a manner so as not to give the components and calculations
duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, the Parties covenant and agree that no
amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either
as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculation of (including
any component of) the Adjusted Purchase Price, or any other calculated amount
pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either
as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be overstated
or understated for purposes of such calculation. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that, if there is a conflict between a determination,
calculation, methodology, procedure or principle set forth in the definitions
contained in this Agreement, as applicable, on the one hand, and those
provided by GAAP, on the other hand, (a) the determination, calculation,
methodology, procedure or principle set forth in this Agreement, as
applicable, shall control to the extent that the matter is specifically
provided for in this Agreement and (b) the determination, calculation or
methodology, procedure or principle prescribed by GAAP shall control to the
extent the matter is not so addressed in this Agreement, as applicable, or
requires reclassification as an asset or liability to be included in a line
item or specific adjustment. 

  

14.9 _Audit Rights_. Seller and/or its Representatives shall have the right to
review, for a period of up to eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date, the books and records of each Sub and the Affiliates of each such Sub
for the sole purpose of determining the provision and accuracy of any
payment, statement, report or other document provided to Seller or required to
be provided to Seller as contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, with
respect to payments to be made by a Sub to Seller in connection with the Subs
A/R, the Severance Tax Abatement Amount and the New Mexico Withholding Tax
Amount.

19.2 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF
LAW PRINCIPLES. 

  

19.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as permitted below,
no party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the
other parties prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or unduly delayed. Buyer shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior
written consent of the other parties but with the obligation to provide
contemporaneous or prior notice to such parties, be entitled to assign this
Agreement or all or any part of its rights or obligations 

      ##### 

  

    

hereunder to one or more Affiliates of Buyer. No assignment by Buyer of any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be effective unless the
assignee shall execute and deliver to the Seller a written agreement between
Buyer and such Permitted Assignee(s), which shall include (i) a description
of the rights and obligations to be assigned by Buyer to the assignee; (ii)
a ratification of, and agreement by the assignee to become subject to and
bound by, the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) representations and
warranties of such assignee that are comparable to the representations and
warranties of Buyer set forth in _Section 6.1_. No assignment of rights or
obligations by Buyer will release or discharge Buyer from any of its
obligations as the " _Buyer_ " under this Agreement or under any Exhibit,
Schedule, certificate, document, instrument, agreement, or writing delivered
pursuant hereto. In the event of any assignment of this Agreement by Buyer to
any of the Permitted Assignees pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this 
_Section 19.3_, the obligations and liabilities of the Permitted Assignees
shall be several and not joint and several. Each Permitted Assignee shall be
liable to Seller only for that percentage of any obligation hereunder
equivalent to the percentage interest in this Agreement assigned to such
Permitted Assignee by Buyer. The representations and warranties made by Buyer
and each Permitted Assignee shall be deemed to be made only by the entity
making such representation or warranty, and neither Buyer or any Permitted
Assignee shall be deemed responsible or liable for the breach of any
representation or warranty by any other party. In the event of such assignment
by Buyer to a Permitted Assignee(s), Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
amend the Escrow Agreement to allow such Permitted Assignee(s) to become a
party to the Escrow Agreement. 

  

19.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties in respect of its subject matter and supersedes all prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the
parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof, excluding the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 22,
2009, between Seller and Buyer (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
is addressed in _Section 19.8_. Other than with respect to the Persons
comprising Seller Group, there are no third party beneficiaries having rights
under or with respect to this Agreement. 

  

19.5 _Amendment; Waiver_. No amendment, modification, replacement, termination
or cancellation of any provision of this Agreement will be valid, unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer, Seller, EPEC and Miller. No
waiver by any party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty
or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty
or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising because of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence. 

  

19.6 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any provision of this Agreement, as applied to any party
or to any circumstance, is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction,
arbitrator, or mediator not to be enforceable in accordance with its terms,
the parties agree that the court of competent jurisdiction, arbitrator, or
mediator, as applicable, making such determination will have the power to
modify the provision in a manner consistent with its objectives such that it
is enforceable, and/or to delete specific words or phrases, and in its
reduced form, such provision will then be enforceable and will be enforced. 

     ##### 

 

  

19.7 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign Law will be
deemed also to refer to such Law as amended and all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Pronouns in
masculine, feminine, and neuter genders will be construed to include
any other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to include
the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. The words
"this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereunder" and words of
similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
subdivision unless expressly so limited. The Exhibits and Schedules identified
in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part
hereof. References herein to any Article or Section shall be references to an
Article or Section of this Agreement, unless the context clearly requires
otherwise. 

  

19.8 _Confidentiality_. All information made available by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be maintained as confidential by Buyer until
Closing, provided that Buyer may disclose such information to any Permitted
Assignee. The parties shall remain subject, until the Closing, to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, at which time of Closing
such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall, with respect to the Non-Transferred
Properties, remain in full force and effect pursuant to its terms, and Seller
agrees to maintain as confidential following the Closing in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement all information relating to the
Property that constituted confidential information thereunder. Buyer shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that Buyers employees,
consultants, Representatives and agents comply with the provisions of this
_Section 19.8_. After Closing, Seller will, in accordance with the
requirements of all Applicable Law, maintain as confidential all information
regarding the Subs and the Properties permitted to be retained (either as an
original or copy) hereunder. 

  

19.9 _Headings_. The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and will not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

19.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in five (5) or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile shall be equally as effective as
delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party
delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile also shall
deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement, but the failure
to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity,
enforceability and binding effect of this Agreement. 

  

19.11 _Expenses and Fees_. 

    

 19.11.1. Except as set forth in this Agreement or the Bidding Procedures Order, each of the parties hereto shall pay its own fees and expenses incident to the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including brokers fees. Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of all fees for the recording of transfer documents. All other costs shall be borne by the 

   ##### 

  

   

party incurring them. Unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, all Taxes
imposed by Taxing Authorities are the obligation of and shall be borne by the
party incurring such Taxes. Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale by Seller and the
purchase by Buyer of the Equity Interests from any sales, use, stamp, real
estate transfer, documentary, registration, recording and other similar taxes
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and to minimize any such Transfer Taxes.
If a determination is ever made that a Transfer Tax applies, Buyer shall be
liable for such tax. BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS
WITH RESPECT TO THE PAYMENT OF ANY OF SUCH TAXES, INCLUDING ALL INTEREST,
FINES AND PENALTIES ASSESSED THEREON. THE INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS
OBLIGATION CONTAINED IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL SURVIVE THE CLOSING. 

   

 19.11.2. Buyer has structured the purchase of the Subs as a sale of the stock of the Subs by Seller and without the conversion of any of the Subs into a single member limited liability company. To the extent that structuring the transaction as a stock sale rather than as a conversion of the Subs into single member limited liability companies followed by the sale of the membership interests in such limited liability companies, treated as disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes, results in any state Tax liabilities for the Seller and/or the Subs, Buyer agrees to pay for any state Tax liability of the Seller and/or the Subs resulting from the transaction being structured as a sale of stock of the Subs as contemplated hereby, up to a maximum amount of $1,500,000.00. Seller shall provide Buyer and its tax advisors with the opportunity at Buyers sole cost and expense to participate in the determination of the additional state Tax liability and to review the Tax Returns in accordance with _Section 19.11.5(g)_. 

   

 19.11.3. Tax Information. Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon written request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Subs, the Equity Interests and the Properties (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election, rendition or protest relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. 

   

 19.11.4. Tax-Sharing Agreements. Any Tax-Sharing Agreement between the Seller and any Sub or between Subs, and all obligations or liabilities arising under any such agreements, shall be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year, or a past year). 

   

 19.11.5. Responsibility and Proration of Taxes, Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes. 

   

(a) Responsibility for Taxes. 

   

 (i) Consistent with the Purchase Price adjustments of  _Article IV_, Seller shall be liable for all Ad Valorem Taxes which shall be accrued 

   ##### 

  

   

up to and including the Effective Time. The Buyer shall be liable for all Ad
Valorem Taxes accrued after the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) Seller shall file a combined report that includes the Subs information through the Closing Date and shall be liable for all Texas franchise Taxes of the Subs through the Closing Date, including any Texas franchise Tax liability attributable to the sale of the Equity Interests by Seller. Buyer shall be responsible for Texas franchise Taxes of the Subs for periods after the Closing Date. 

   

 (iii) Seller shall be liable for all income and other Taxes of the Subs attributable to income, production or activity through the Closing Date, including any Tax liability attributable to the sale of the Equity Interests by Seller. Buyer shall be responsible for income and other Taxes of the Subs attributable to income, production or activity for periods occurring after the Closing Date. 

   

 (iv) With respect to Ad Valorem Taxes, in the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Effective Time (the " _Straddle Period_ "), the Ad Valorem Taxes accrued as of the Effective Time shall be equal to the amount of such Ad Valorem Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period up to and including the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period. The party liable for any Ad Valorem Tax shall have all available rights to legally contest the Tax, provided, however, that the Buyer shall control, but shall allow the Seller (at Sellers request and expense) to participate in, any contest with respect to Ad Valorem Taxes for a Straddle Period). 

   

 (v) In the case of Straddle Periods for all other Taxes any allocation and responsibility for such Taxes shall be based on the actual revenue and expenses before and after the Effective Time or if the Tax cannot be calculated on that basis, then such Taxes shall be pro rated as provided in (iv) immediately above. Seller shall be responsible for such Taxes that are attributable to periods before the Effective Time and Buyer shall be responsible for such Taxes that are attributable to periods from and after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) Any Tax Return required to be filed with respect to Ad Valorem Taxes shall be prepared and timely filed, or caused to be prepared and timely filed, by the party liable hereunder for the payment of such Taxes, provided, however, that in the case of any such Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period, the Seller shall cause to be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return required to be filed prior to the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall cause to be prepared and timely filed any Tax Return that is not required to be filed until after the Closing Date. If the Buyer or the Seller receives any invoice for any Ad 

   ##### 

  

   

Valorem Tax which is allocable to any other party in part or in full
hereunder, the recipient shall forward a copy of the invoice promptly to the
other party. In the case of any Tax Return with respect to a Straddle Period,
the party responsible for filing such Tax Return shall request the
appropriate reimbursement for the other partys allocable portion of the Ad
Valorem Taxes due, and the party owing such reimbursement shall pay such
reimbursement within the later of the day such Taxes are due or 10 days after
receipt of the reimbursement request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever
time permits, each party will make every reasonable effort to determine each
partys appropriate allocable share of any Ad Valorem Tax due and to pay the
allocable share to the party responsible under this paragraph for paying
the Tax in a timely fashion in order to avoid any late payment penalty. 

   

 (c) Seller shall prepare and cause to be filed the combined Texas franchise Tax Return including the Subs for periods through and including the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and cause to be filed the Texas franchise Tax Returns of the Subs for periods beginning after the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Except as set forth in _Section 19.11.5(b)_ and _(c)_ , Buyer shall prepare and cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Subs relating solely to periods commencing after the Closing Date. 

   

 (e) Except as set forth in _Sections 19.11.5(b),_ _(c)_ , and  _(d)_ and consistent with _Section 19.11.5(a)_, Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns of or which include any of the Subs that are required to be filed (after giving effect to any valid extension of time in which to make such filing). Seller shall timely pay all Taxes shown due on Tax Returns described in this _Section 19.11.5(e)_. However, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any Taxes on such Tax Returns for which Buyer is responsible under _Section 19.11.5(a)_ within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving a copy of the Tax Return and the calculation of Buyers share of Taxes from Seller. Further, Buyer and Seller may agree in writing for Buyer to prepare and file such other Tax Returns when in the best interest of both parties. 

   

 (f) All Tax Returns described in _Section 19.11.5_ for taxable periods ending on or before or which include the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice unless a past practice has been finally determined to be incorrect by the applicable Taxing Authority or a contrary treatment is required by applicable Tax laws (or the judicial or administrative interpretations thereof). 

   

 (g) Seller will provide Buyer with copies of all Tax Returns (other than the consolidated federal income tax return and the combined Texas franchise tax return of Seller and the Subs) described in _Section 19.11.5(e)_ and filed after the Closing Date at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the filing date. Buyer shall be provided an opportunity to review such returns and all supporting workpapers, schedules and information, and to propose changes, not later than 

   ##### 

  

   

twenty (20) Business Days prior to the filing date of such Tax Returns.
In addition, Buyer shall be provided the opportunity to review elections made
in the consolidated federal income tax return and the combined Texas
franchise tax return of Seller and the Subs. Seller shall make such revisions
to the Tax Returns as are reasonably and properly requested by Buyer,
provided that such changes do not increase the Tax liability of Seller or the
Subs. The failure of Buyer to propose any changes to any such Tax Returns
prior to the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period shall be
deemed to be an indication of their approval thereof. The Seller shall have
the same rights with respect to any Tax Returns prepared by Buyer for any
Straddle Period. 

   

 (h) (i) Subject as hereinafter provided, Seller will, as instructed by Buyer, make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1\. 1502-3 6(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce the tax basis in the shares of common stock of the Subs (the " _Shares of the Subs_ ") by an amount equal to the excess of the tax basis over the fair market value of the Shares of the Subs immediately before Closing. Seller will also, as instructed by Buyer, duly make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1502-95(f) to apportion, as appropriate, all or part of the consolidated Section 382 limitation, the sub-group Section 382 limitation, and the loss groups or loss sub-groups net unrealized built-in gain (if any) to the Subs. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer hereby agrees that it shall, following Sellers provision of the underlying information which is in its possession, both prepare (or cause the preparation of) and pay for all costs and expenses in any way associated with the preparation and filing of the federal Tax elections contemplated by the terms of this _Section 19.11.5(h)_ , other than the costs and expenses of Seller associated with the preparation and filing of its Tax returns that are not related to the making of such elections. Sellers obligation with respect to providing the underlying information will be to provide such information that it has in its present form. To the extent Buyer requests Seller to provide analysis of such information or to compile it or otherwise change its form or format, Buyer agrees to pay the costs and expenses incurred by Seller in complying with such request. 

   

 19.11.6. _Certain Other Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be paid by Seller when due, and Seller shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such transfer Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, Buyer will, and will cause Subs to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation and will cooperate with Seller to take such commercially reasonable actions as will minimize or reduce the amount of such Taxes. 

   

 19.11.7. _Tax Audits_. 

   

 (a) Except for Ad Valorem Taxes as set forth in _Sections 19.11.5(a)_ and _(b)_ : Seller shall have the sole right (but not the obligation) to represent the 

   ##### 

  

   

interests of the Subs in any audit or administrative or court proceeding (a "
_Tax Proceeding_ ") relating to Taxes for taxable periods of the Subs
which end on or before the Closing Date and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense. Buyer agrees that, at Sellers cost, it will cooperate fully,
and shall cause the Subs to cooperate fully, with Seller and its counsel in
the defense against or compromise of any claim in any said proceeding. 

   

 (b) Seller at its sole cost has the right, but not the obligation, to jointly represent the interests of the Subs with the Buyer in any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes for any Straddle Period of the Subs. Any disputes regarding the conduct or resolution of any such audit or proceeding shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 19.11.8_. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Subs in all Tax Proceedings other than Tax Proceedings described in clauses (a), (b) and (d) of this _Section 19.11.7_. 

   

 (d) Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate or successor of Buyer or any such Affiliate shall (or shall cause or permit any of the Subs to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Sub with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Seller. 

   

 (e) If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes or affects any Taxes for which Seller is responsible hereunder, Buyer shall, promptly upon receipt by Buyer and/or the Subs of notice thereof, inform Seller thereof. 

   

 19.11.8. _Resolution of Certain Disputes_. In the event that Seller or Buyer disputes the application or interpretation of any provision of _Sections 19.11.5_,  _19.11.7_ and _19.11.12_ hereof, or the amount, allocation or calculation, payment or reimbursement of Taxes, if any, owed by such party thereunder, such party shall deliver to the other a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of and/or the dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute within twenty (20) days following the commencement of such dispute. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve such dispute within such twenty (20) day period, the dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee shall determine, only with respect to the specific disagreements submitted in writing by Seller and Buyer, the manner in which such item or items in dispute should be resolved; provided, however, that the dollar amount of any such item or items shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts proposed by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Accounting Referee shall be directed to make such determination promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after acceptance of its appointment. Any finding by the Accounting Referee shall be a reasoned award stating the findings of fact and conclusions of law (if any) on which it is based, shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding the disputed items so presented. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be 

   ##### 

  

   

shared by Seller and Buyer (A) in proportion to each partys respective
liability for Taxes which are the subject of the dispute as determined by the
Accounting Referee, or (B) in equal proportions if the subject of the dispute
involves Tax Returns for which no Taxes are due. The parties shall otherwise
bear their own expenses incurred in any dispute resolution pursuant to this
_Section 19.11.8_. 

   

 19.11.9. _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any refunds of Taxes (together with any interest with respect thereto) paid to or in respect of the Subs (including any amounts credited against income tax to which Buyer, its Affiliates or any of the Subs becomes entitled) and that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Effective Time for Ad Valorem Taxes and the Closing Date for all other Taxes shall be for the account of Seller. Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such credit (in each case, together with any interest with respect thereto) within fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Any refunds or credits of Taxes (together with any interest with respect thereto) of the Subs for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer consistent with _Section 19.11.5(a)_. Buyer shall, if Seller so requests and at Sellers expense, prepare, execute and file any claims for refunds or credits, or cause the Subs to prepare, execute and file any claims for refunds or credits, to which Seller is entitled under this _Section 19.11.9_. Buyer shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund at Sellers sole cost. 

   

 19.11.10. _Certain Elections_. To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer shall not permit the Subs to carry back any loss, deduction or credit to any taxable period that ends on, prior to or which includes the Closing Date. 

   

 19.11.11. _FIRPTA_. Seller shall furnish to Buyer on or before the Closing Date a certification of its non-foreign status consistent with the requirements set forth in Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations. 

   

 19.11.12. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon an allocation of the Purchase Price among the Properties of the Subs. 

 

19.12 _Public Announcements_. Except as contemplated by the terms of the
Bidding Procedures and Sale Motion and as required by state or federal
securities Law, the parties hereto hereby agree that prior to making any
public announcement or statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller (on behalf of itself and
the Subs) or Buyer, as applicable, desiring to make such public announcement
or statement shall consult with the other (Seller or Buyer, as applicable),
and endeavor in good faith to obtain the prior written approval of the
other to the text of a public announcement or statement to be made solely by
Seller, on the one hand, or solely by Buyer, on the other, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this  _Section 19.12_ to the
contrary, neither party shall be required to obtain approval from the other
before issuing a press release announcing the execution of this Agreement or
the Closing or filing a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the Closing. 

       ##### 

  

    

19.13 _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding any term or provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any party to this Agreement be
liable for any consequential, special, indirect, incidental, exemplary,
punitive or similar damages or lost profits arising out of or relating to
this Agreement. 

  

19.14 _Jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court; Dispute Resolution; No Jury_. 

    

 19.14.1. Without limiting any partys right to appeal any Order of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties agree that the Bankruptcy Court will have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under this Agreement. 

   

 19.14.2. In the event the Bankruptcy Court does not have jurisdiction over a dispute that arises under this Agreement, or for whatever reason fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over any other dispute arising hereunder then, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to submit all controversies, disputes and claims arising hereunder and not otherwise resolved by the parties in writing to the exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate State of Texas court located in Harris County, Texas or, to the extent permitted by Law, the federal courts in the Southern District of Texas (to whose jurisdiction the parties hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally submit), and to any appellate court from any therefrom, in any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally agrees that all claims and Losses in respect of any such dispute may be heard and determined in such State of Texas court, or to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any defense of any inconvenient forum or improper venue to the maintenance of any such dispute in any such court and any right of jurisdiction on account of its place of residence or domicile. Each of the parties irrevocably, unqualifiedly and unconditionally consents to the service of any and all process in any such dispute in such State of Texas or federal court by the sending of such process to each of the applicable parties at the addresses and in the manner specified in _Section 19.1_, or as otherwise may be permitted or required by Applicable Law. Each of the parties agrees that the final judgment in any such dispute, following exhaustion of all remedies by appeal, shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. 

   

 19.14.3. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE ARISING HEREUNDER AND CONSENTS TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

 

19.15 _Releases_. Except for the enumerated obligations of the Seller under
this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates
(and any Permitted Assignee), to the extent permitted by Law, is each hereby
deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally released, remised, and forever
