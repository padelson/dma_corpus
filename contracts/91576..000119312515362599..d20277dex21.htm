-vii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 30, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between KeyCorp, an Ohio corporation (" _Parent_ ") and First
Niagara Financial Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies, their
stockholders, employees and communities to consummate the strategic business
combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company
will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and
into Parent (the " _Merger_ "), so that Parent is the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") in the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended
to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Ohio General Corporation Law (the " _OGCL_ ") and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
the Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Ohio. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street,
New York, New York, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business
days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than
those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time
or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
on or before the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall cause to be filed
certificates of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio (the "
_Ohio Secretary_ ") and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") (collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_
"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time specified in the
Certificates of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the OGCL and the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise
owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than shares of Company
Common Stock (i) held in any Company Benefit Plans or related trust accounts,
managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary
or agency capacity and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in respect
of debts previously contracted (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ "))
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.680 shares (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") and (ii) $2.30 in cash (the " _Per
Share Cash Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and
(ii), the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) All the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2. Old Certificates previously representing shares of
Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at Parents
option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively referred to herein
as " _New Certificates_ "), representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash as set forth in Section 1.5(a) (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares
issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Old

 



-2-  Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon.
If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, or changed into
or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in any
such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio to give holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Parent (in each case other than the Exception Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the Merger Consideration nor
any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6 _Company Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Fixed
Rate-to-Floating Rate Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into a share of a newly created series of preferred
stock of Parent having such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers,
and limitations and restrictions that are not materially less favorable to
the holder thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers
of the Company Preferred Stock (all shares of each such newly created series,
collectively, the " _New Parent Preferred Stock_ ") and, upon such
conversion, the Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time.

 

1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

1.8 _Appraisal Rights_. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the per share Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice upon receipt by the Company of any
such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Common
Stock, any withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided
pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being
hereinafter called a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "). The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the
taking of any other action by such Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary
to perfect appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Company shall give Parent the
reasonable opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations

 



-3-  and proceedings with respect to any such demands. Any payments made in
respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his, her or its right to such payment at or
prior to the Effective Time, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall be converted into a right to receive cash and Parent Common Stock in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

1.9 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock under a Company Stock Plan (as defined below),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into a stock option exercisable for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Company Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (as defined below in Section 1.9(e)(i)) with an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (y) the Company
Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code and, in the case of Company Stock Options that are intended
to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Each such
Company Stock Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be converted into that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (ii)
the Company Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Each such Company Restricted Stock
Award as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject
to, the same terms and conditions, including vesting, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options and the
Company Restricted Stock Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall be
converted into a restricted stock unit award for a number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award (and with respect to any Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award that is subject to a performance vesting
condition, in whole or in part, such vesting condition

 



-4-  shall be deemed satisfied at target level) multiplied by (ii) the Company
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any fractional shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award shall entitle the holder
thereof to receive a pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time. Each such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award as so assumed
and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions, including vesting (other than performance vesting), as
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.9. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the obligations of the Company
under each Company Stock Plan under which a Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Stock Award or Company Restricted Stock Unit Award is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock
Option, Company Restricted Stock Award and Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, and the number and
kind of shares available for issuance under each such Company Stock Plan shall
be adjusted to reflect shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Company Stock Plan. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at
least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be
subject to Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by
Section 1.9(a). As of or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, shall distribute a prospectus relating to such
Form S-8, if applicable, and Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company Restricted
Stock Unit Awards (as converted) remain outstanding.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(i) " _Company Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (A) the
Exchange Ratio and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the Per Share
Cash Consideration by (II) the Parent Share Closing Price (as defined below in
Section 2.2(e)).

 

(ii) " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Companys 2012 Equity Incentive Plan,
as amended, and the Companys Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive
Stock Benefit Plan.

1.10 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.
At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of
Parent, as amended (the " _Parent Articles_ "), and Amended and Restated
Regulations of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ ") shall be the articles of
incorporation and regulations of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

 



-5- 1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

1.12 _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Parent and the Company may at
any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated
by this Agreement if and to the extent that both Parent and the Company
mutually deem such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration
to be issued hereunder, (B) impede or delay consummation of the Merger or (C)
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of the recipients of
consideration hereunder in connection with the Merger.

 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _Parent to Make Shares Available_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New Certificates to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (b) cash in an
amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and
New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to
Section 6.10), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent, _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(b). From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of
an Old

 



-6-  Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New
Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A)
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II and (C) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of
Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or
distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with
this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of
Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after
giving effect to Section 6.10).

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to,
as provided in this Article II.

 



-7- (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the volume
weighted average price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the " _NYSE_ ") for the five (5) full trading days ending on the day
preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any
other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-8- ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this
Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article
III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (" _BHC
Act_ "). The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted in all material respects. The Company is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes,
after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements or interpretations
thereof, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules, regulations or
agency requirements of general applicability to companies in the industries in
which such person and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by
courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof,
in global, national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak
of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market conditions affecting the
financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to such
person or its Subsidiaries, including changes in prevailing interest rates
and in the credit and securities markets, (D) failure, in and of itself, to
meet internal

 



-9-  or other estimates, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income or any
other measure of financial performance, or changes in the trading prices of
such persons securities, but not, in any such case, including the underlying
causes thereof; (E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or actions expressly required by this Agreement in
contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or
omissions taken pursuant to the written consent of Parent, in the case of the
Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change
are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies
in the industry in which such person and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii)
the ability of such person to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with
respect to any person, means any other person Controlled by such person,
whether directly or indirectly, or any other person who owns securities or
other ownership interests having a majority of the economic interest or voting
power of such person. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Control_ " and
the correlative terms " _Controlling_ " and " _Controlled_ ", means, with
respect to any specified person, the power to direct the management and
policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

(b) True and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Parent.

(c) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority
to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the Company that is an
insured depository institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in
Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in
connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the
termination of such insurance are pending or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened. Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of (x) all Subsidiaries of the Company as of
the date hereof and (y) all persons (not including Company Subsidiaries) in
which the Company, together with any Company Subsidiaries, owns (directly or
indirectly) 5% or more of a class of voting securities (other than as part of
Company Banks investment portfolio).

 



-10- 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 500,000,000 shares

securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding,
other than (i) 366,002,045 shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding, which number includes 820,385 shares of Company Common Stock
granted in respect of outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards, (ii)

issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. No bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote are issued or outstanding. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this
Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company
are issued or outstanding. Other than the Company Equity Awards issued prior
to the date of this Agreement or permitted to be issued pursuant to Section
5.2(b)(iii), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or
agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any such securities. Each grant of a Company Equity
Award was duly authorized no later than the grant date of such award by all
necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the Board of
Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary
number of votes. Each such grant was made under a Company Stock Plan and in
all material respects in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws, including the
rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Each grant of a Company Equity Award was
properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable laws. The
Company has not granted, and there is not, and has not been, any Company
policy or practice to grant, Company Equity Awards immediately prior to,
or otherwise coordinate the grant of such awards with, the release or other
public announcement of material information regarding the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or any of their financial results or prospects.

 

(b) There are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other
agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries has a contractual obligation with respect to the voting or
transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the Company.
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct
and complete list of all Company Equity Awards outstanding as of the date

Award was granted, (v) the exercise price for each such Company Equity Award

Stock Option. Other than the Company Equity Awards, no equity-based awards
(including any cash awards where the amount of payment is determined in whole
or in part based on the price of any capital stock of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries) are outstanding.

(c) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such
shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to First Niagara Bank,
N.A, a national bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _Company
Bank_ "), as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55) and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary
of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.
The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
the Company and has directed that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to the Companys stockholders for adoption at
a meeting of such stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing
effect. Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding
Company Common Stock (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "), no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement
or to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except in all
cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting insured depository institutions or
their parent companies or the rights of creditors generally and subject
to general principles of equity (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the 

 



-12-  Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents,
approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.4 and Section 4.4 are duly

upon any of the respective properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or
creations which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ") under the BHC Act and

and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection

Effect on the Company. Except for examinations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of the Company, investigation into the business or
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by

meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Company SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the

date of this Agreement, no executive officer of the Company has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or

outstanding comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with

accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or

procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is

the Company by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely

required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) has disclosed based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (x)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or

13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of the Company, any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by Company management to the
Companys

 



-15-  auditors and audit committee and a copy has been previously made available
to Parent. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that
the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,

written or, to the knowledge of the Company, oral, that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its

necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each

in connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and to the knowledge of the Company, there has

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article
IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article IV
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (but
disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors", or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Parent hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Ohio and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company under the BHC Act. Parent has the corporate power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Parent is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) True and complete copies of the Parent Articles and Parent Bylaws, as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by Parent to the Company.

(c) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") (i) is
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property

 



-28-  or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which
the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be likely, either individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (iii)
has all requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to own or lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. The
deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of Parent that is an insured depository
institution are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the
fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for
the termination of such insurance are pending or, to Parents knowledge,
threatened. Section 4.1(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Subsidiaries of Parent as of the date hereof.

 

4.2 _Capitalization_.

or other voting securities of Parent are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, other than (i) 835,360,741 shares of Parent Common Stock issued

12,425,298 shares of Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the
settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit and performance unit awards in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Restricted Stock Unit
Awards_ ") and (v) 2,900,234 shares of Parent preferred stock issued and
outstanding. As used herein, the " _Parent Stock Plans_ " shall mean all
employee and director equity incentive plans of Parent in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and agreements for equity awards in respect of Parent
Common Stock granted by Parent under the inducement grant exception. All the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on
any matters on which stockholders of Parent may vote are issued or
outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, no trust preferred or subordinated
debt securities of Parent are issued or outstanding. Other than Parent Stock
Options and Parent Restricted Stock Unit Awards issued prior to the date of

or other commitments or agreements obligating Parent to issue, transfer,
sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any securities of Parent.

agreements in effect pursuant to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has a
contractual obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of the Parent
Common Stock or other equity interests of Parent. 

 



-29- (c) Parent owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of KeyBank
National Association, a national bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(" _Parent Bank_ "), free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares or
equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable (except, with respect to Parent Subsidiaries that
are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12 U.S.C. § 55 or any
comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary
of Parent has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

4.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) Parent has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Parent. The
Board of Directors of Parent has determined that the Merger, on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
Parent and its stockholders, and has directed that this Agreement and the

") be submitted to Parents stockholders for approval at a meeting of such
stockholders and has adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. Except for
the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
the approval of the Parent Charter Amendment, in each case, by the
affirmative vote of the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock entitling
them to exercise a majority of the voting power of Parent on such matter
(collectively, the " _Requisite Parent Vote_ ") and the adoption of
resolutions to give effect to the provisions of Section 6.11 in connection
with the Closing, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company)
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against
Parent in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). The shares of
Parent Common Stock and New Parent Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger
have been validly authorized and, when issued, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable, and no current or past stockholder of Parent will have
any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, nor the
consummation by Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Parent with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)
violate any provision of the Parent Articles or the Parent Bylaws, or (ii)
assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 3.3
and 4.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction

termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of
trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause
(ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which either individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal Reserve Board under the
BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and notices, (ii) the

connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement and the approval of the listing of such Parent Common Stock and

filings or registrations with any Governmental Entity are necessary in
connection with (A) the execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement or
(B) the consummation by Parent of the Merger. As of the date hereof, Parent is
not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger on a timely
basis.

4.5  _Reports_.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations
of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except for examinations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or operations of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013, except where such
proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on 

 



-31-  Parent. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013
(the " _Parent SEC Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Parent
SEC Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. As of their respective dates, all Parent SEC Reports filed or furnished
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of
Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or

in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, since January
1, 2013, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP. Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned (or informed Parent that it intends
to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Parent as a
result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against 

 



-32-  on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 30, 2015, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof to Parents outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information,
and (y) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by Parent management to Parents auditors and audit committee and a
copy has been previously made available to the Company. To the knowledge of
Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due. 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant
or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent,
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of
Parent, oral, that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors or employees to the Board of
Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to
any director or officer of Parent.

 



-33- 4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary nor any of
their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or

KeyBanc Capital Markets.

would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate,

contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Parent and
its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material
respects in the ordinary course.

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, is (i) material to it and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or is reasonably likely to result in a material restriction
on its or any of its Subsidiaries businesses or (ii) reasonably likely to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay its ability to perform its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership
of their respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each
(and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith), except where neither the cost of failure to hold nor
the cost of obtaining and holding such license, franchise, permit or
authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or assessments) would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there has been no
suspension or cancellation or written threat to suspend or cancel any such
necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization. Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in

relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer

conducting operations at all times in compliance in all material respects
with applicable Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Parent and its Subsidiaries have

material respects all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including

accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

notice of, any violation of any Parent Contract by any of the other parties

by and material to the operation of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

Regulatory Approvals, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or
the Company to take, or agree to take, any action or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with the grant of a Requisite Regulatory Approval,
that would be more likely than not to have a material and adverse effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving effect to the Merger
(measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) (the " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(d) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the
Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to the respective stockholders of the Company or Parent and at
the time of the Companys or Parents meeting of its respective stockholders
to consider and vote upon adoption of this Agreement, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each
of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party
thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement.

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



-43- 6.2 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws and regulations,
including those applicable to confidential supervisory information, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and
other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems and
records, and each shall cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute
after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business
operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality,
non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers and/or the
other party), and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party such information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access.

(b) Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information pursuant to
this Section 6.2 where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice
the rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be, customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties), or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2 in confidence to the extent required
by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement,
dated September 13, 2015, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(d) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.3 _Stockholder Approvals_.

 

(a) The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to its
stockholders that they approve this Agreement, and will submit to its
stockholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by
its stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. The
Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to recommend to its stockholders
that they approve the Parent Stockholder Matters, and will submit to its
stockholders the Parent Stockholder Matters and any other matters required to
be approved

 



-44-  by its stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement.
In furtherance of that obligation, each of Parent and the Company shall take,
in accordance with applicable law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws
(in the case of the Company) and the Parent Articles and Parent Bylaws (in the
case of Parent), all action necessary to convene a meeting of its respective
stockholders (such meetings, the " _Company Meeting_ " and the " _Parent
Meeting_ ", respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after
the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote, as applicable, required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and mutually
agreed, upon other matters required to be approved by its respective
stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement.
The Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from the stockholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, and
the Board of Directors of Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain from the stockholders of Parent the Requisite Parent Vote, in each
case including by communicating to its respective stockholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that, in the case of the Company, they adopt and approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in the case of Parent,
that they approve the Parent Stockholder Matters. Each of Parent and the
Company shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to the other
party to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating to
the Requisite Parent Vote and the Requisite Company Vote, respectively.
However, if the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would reasonably be expected to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to, or to continue to,
recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
stockholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement
to its stockholders without recommendation, or may change its recommendation
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of
the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or
change in its recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
law; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any
actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least five (5)
business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and
a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its
determination to take such action (including, in the event such action is
taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or
describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at
the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes
into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by
Parent, and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good
faith that it would nevertheless reasonably be expected to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement.
Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. The Company acknowledges
that Parent may submit to its stockholders at the Parent Meeting a proposal
to amend the terms of the Parent Bylaws to increase the maximum size of the
Board of Directors of Parent from sixteen (16) to seventeen (17) members.

 



-45- (b) Parent and the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as applicable, if, as of the time for which such meeting is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock, as applicable, represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting, the Parent or the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the Requisite Parent Vote or the Requisite Company Vote, as
applicable, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together
with their respective proxy solicitors, to assist in the solicitation
of proxies from stockholders relating to the Requisite Parent Vote or the
Requisite Company Vote, as applicable. Parent and the Company shall only be
required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as
applicable, twice pursuant to this Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Parent Meeting and the Company Meeting shall be
convened, and the Parent Stockholder Matters and this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Parent and the Company at the Parent Meeting
and the Company Meeting, as applicable, for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Parent Vote or Requisite Company Vote, as applicable, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either party of such obligation.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting on the same date. Each party shall cooperate
and keep the other party informed on a current basis regarding its
solicitation efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the
Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of each party.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1,
Section 6.3 and Section 6.12 of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts,
in each case as promptly as practicable (a) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal
and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the Merger, and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock and the New Parent Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and continuing through the
first anniversary thereof, Parent shall provide each continuing employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with: (i) annual base salary or wages, annual
incentive opportunities and long-term incentive compensation opportunities
that are no less than the annual base salary or wages, annual incentive
opportunities and long-term incentive compensation opportunities, in each
case,

 



-46-  in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
defined contribution retirement and employee welfare benefits (including
retiree medical) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to either
(x) the defined contribution retirement and employee welfare benefits
(including retiree medical) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time or (y) to the defined
contribution retirement and employee welfare benefits (excluding retiree
medical) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, (iii) a position
(A) requiring substantially comparable skills and abilities as the employees
position immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) that includes a work
status (full or part-time) that is not changed from that in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (iv) severance payments and benefits to each
continuing employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as set forth on
Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(excluding any retiree medical plan) in which any employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions
or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii)
provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for any
co-payments or coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time
under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-
of-pocket requirements under any New Plans and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, including, but not
limited to, (A) banking privileges and perquisites applicable to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (both by job classification
or status and by geographic location) and (B) for benefit accrual or level of
benefits for vacation, paid time off and severance benefits; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for
purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, or (z) to any benefit plan that
is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

(c) Parent agrees to assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance
with their terms as of the date hereof or as modified consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, it being understood that this sentence shall not be
construed to limit the ability of Parent or any of its affiliates to amend or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan to the extent such amendment or termination
is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall honor all deferral elections that have been properly made
prior to the Effective Time under each Company Benefit Plan that is set forth
under Item 4 of Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (including,
without limitation, by not terminating any such Company Benefit Plan within
the one-year period following the Effective Date pursuant to the change in
control plan termination rules set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)).

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates any right to continue

 



-47-  in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify
any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and
former director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Company Benefit
Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the consideration and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; and Parent shall advance expenses as
incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law; _provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary
form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of
the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and, if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to
be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents

 



-48-  good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, after taking into
account the purposes of this Section 6.7), may (and at the request of Parent,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to
the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfers all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engages in any similar transaction, then in
each case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent required
by any agreement previously entered into by the Company in connection with a
merger, acquisition or other business combination, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 shall apply to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of
predecessor entities previously acquired by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Company under this Section 6.7 shall not
be terminated or modified in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this Section
6.7 without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified
Party or such other person.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other
party, at the expense of the party who makes any such request.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the
other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i) that
has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case
unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



-49- 6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

6.11 _Governance_.

 

(a) Parent shall take all appropriate action to appoint, as of the Effective
Time, three (3) current members of the Board of Directors of the Company
selected by the Company to the Board of Directors of Parent. Such directors
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent (including Parents Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee).

 

(b) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall invite members
of the Board of Directors of the Company (other than those individuals
specified in Section 6.11(a)) to serve as members of one or more regional
advisory boards in accordance with Parents customary practice.

 

(c) On the Closing Date, Parent shall support the First Niagara Foundation and
shall contribute to the First Niagara Foundation an amount in cash equal to
$20,000,000. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide office facilities of Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent, located in Western New York, for use by the First Niagara Foundation.

 

(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to support a meaningful employee presence in Western New York.

6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to receipt of
the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement and
its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than
not to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; 

 



-50-   _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms,
in all material respects, no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other
than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent in
writing following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance
thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof), and will promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company, to enforce any
existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with its terms. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,
subject to applicable law, to, within ten (10) business days after the
date hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any
confidential information provided to any person (other than Parent and its
affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement. Unless this Agreement is contemporaneously terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other definitive transaction agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance
with this Section 6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
third party indication of interest relating to, (i) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or
other business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company, except, in each case, any
sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and
any _bona fide_ internal reorganization. As used in this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to be more
favorable to its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors
(who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after
taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the
terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with
the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of
any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including

 



-51-  any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any
other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ , that for
purposes of the definition of " _Superior Proposal_ ," the references to
"20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority."

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

6.13 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement required
by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental Entity
or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, the Company and Parent agree to consult with each other
and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall take any
action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
Parent and the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if
necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover
Statute.

6.15 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section

subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Company Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this Section 6.15. The Board of Directors of Parent and of
the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Company
Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Company

 



-52-  Equity Awards and (ii) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock, New Parent
Preferred Stock, and/or Company Stock Options exercisable for shares of Parent
Common Stock converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.9(a), in
each case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by
any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers
or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

 

6.16 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or
the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto,
or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.17 _Assumption of the Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the Effective
Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees and other instruments
required for the due assumption of the Companys or Company
Banks outstanding debt, guarantees, securities and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities and other

Bank to execute, if requested by Parent, such certificates or articles of
merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary, to effect,
immediately following the Effective Time or at such later time as Parent may
determine, the Bank Merger pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger in form
and substance customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger.

 

6.20 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time,

 



-53-  each of Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company and Parent:

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger, and such
denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order,
injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , that a party may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) if the failure to obtain
a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of such party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that a party may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (c) if the failure of the Closing to occur
by such date shall be due to the failure of such party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement

 



-56-  contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants
or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such
representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section
7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the
Termination Date and sixty (60) days following written notice to the Company,
in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a
termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during
such period; or

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (A) submits
this Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or publicly
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its
stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially
breaches its obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12; or (ii) a tender
offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and
the Board of Directors of the Company recommends that the stockholders of the
Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange
offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that the Confidentiality
Agreement, Section 6.2(c), this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud
or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of
the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock of
the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered
to the stockholders of the Company). " _Willful Breach_ " shall mean a
material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or
other agreements contained in, this Agreement, that is a consequence of an act
or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual
knowledge, or knowledge that a person acting reasonably under
the circumstances should have,

 



-57-  that such partys act or failure to act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, result in or constitute a breach of or failure of performance
under this Agreement.

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of the
Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced (whether or not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company, and (A) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without
the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior
to the date that is one (1) year after the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $137,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(i), all references in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee as promptly as reasonably practical after the
date of termination (and, in any event, within three (3) business days
thereafter).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to the extent permitted
by Section 8.2(d), the maximum aggregate amount of fees payable by the Company
under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee. In no event
shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent or the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a
judgment against Parent or the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall pay the costs and
expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company
fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such
party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing
as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and
Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a
penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole
monetary remedy of the other party in the

 



-58-  event of a termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments
referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or
liability to any other person. In some 

 



-62-  instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Except as provided in Section 6.7, notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any
third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement. 

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party
hereto.

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
