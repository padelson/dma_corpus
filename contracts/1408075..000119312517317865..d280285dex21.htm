interests of any other Person engaged in a Restricted Business (an &#147;<U>Acquired Competing Business</U>&#148;), Transferor shall no later than 30 Business Days after such acquisition notify Issuer in writing of such acquisition. Such notice by
Transferor to Issuer (the &#147;<U>Proposed Sale Notice</U>&#148;) shall state Transferor&#146;s intention to sell all of the Acquired Competing Business within 12 months of its acquisition (the &#147;<U>Proposed Sale</U>&#148;), the price on a cash
free, debt free basis that Transferor proposes to be paid for such Acquired Competing Business (the &#147;<U>Proposed Sale Price</U>&#148;), and the other material terms of the Proposed Sale. </P>

other than cash, then at the equivalent cash price, determined in good faith by Transferor and Issuer) and on the terms and conditions described in the Proposed Sale Notice, by delivering an irrevocable written notice (the &#147;<U>Acceptance
Notice</U>&#148;) to Transferor indicating that Issuer (or designee thereof) shall purchase the Acquired Competing Business being offered in the Proposed Sale and designating a date for the closing that is within 90 days after end of the Acceptance
Period (subject to any necessary extensions for regulatory or other required approvals to consummate such closing). Upon delivery of the Acceptance Notice by Issuer, Transferor and Issuer shall be obligated to consummate the Proposed Sale on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Acceptance Notice (subject to any necessary extensions for regulatory or other required approvals to consummate such closing). </P>

Competing Business, shall provide, or cause to be provided to, Issuer and its Representatives reasonable access to the Representatives of Transferor and the Acquired Competing Business during normal business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with business and operations of Transferor and the Acquired Competing Business. Such access shall include access to the Acquired Competing Business&#146; properties, Contracts, commitments, books, records, financial and
operating data and other information, including environmental information, papers, plans and drawings and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Transferor, the Acquired Competing Business or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be required to provide any information to the extent that
such information or such access thereto would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or violate any law or Contract. Issuer will hold, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries to hold, and will direct its and their Representatives to
hold, any and all information received from Transferor or the Acquired Competing Business, directly or indirectly, in confidence. </P>

consideration to be paid) to Transferor at the principal office of Issuer against delivery of certificates or other instruments representing the Acquired Competing Business so purchased, appropriately endorsed by Transferor (or other conveyance
documentation reasonably requested by the purchaser in the case of uncertificated securities or other acquired assets). If at the end of the Acceptance Period Issuer has not delivered an Acceptance Notice, Transferor may, during the 270 days
immediately following the Acceptance Period, sell the Acquired Competing Business that is the subject of the Proposed Sale to a transferee for consideration having a value of not less than 100% of the Proposed Sale Price and on other terms not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to Transferor than those contained in the Proposed Sale Notice. Promptly after such sale, Transferor shall notify Issuer of the consummation thereof and shall furnish such written evidence of the completion
of such sale and of the terms thereof as may reasonably be requested by Issuer. If Transferor is unable to sell the Acquired Competing Business that is the subject of the Proposed Sale during such 270 days in accordance with the terms set forth in
this <U>Section&nbsp;1(b)</U>, then Transferor shall again offer to sell such Acquired Competing Business to Issuer. If Issuer elects to purchase such Acquired Competing Business, Issuer shall be obligated to acquire it at a cash free, debt free
price determined by an independent valuation firm mutually selected in good faith by Transferor and Issuer. If Issuer does not elect to purchase such Acquired Competing Business, Transferor may continue to own or operate it notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Restricted Business</U>&#148; shall mean (<U>i</U>)&nbsp;the
manufacturing, distribution or sale of coated paperboard and/or coated paperboard products in North America (it being acknowledged and agreed that Transferor and its Subsidiaries currently engage in, and shall not be prohibited from continuing to
engage in, such activities outside of North America) or (<U>ii</U>)&nbsp;the manufacturing, distribution or sale of fiber-based food container or tableware products (including plates and cups) (or lids therefor), or substitutes therefor, in the case

Sublandlord shall have the right to enter the Subleased Premises from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to Subtenant, during normal business hours and escorted by Subtenant (if Subtenant makes such escort reasonably available).
Sublandlord&#146;s right of entry shall include the right of inspection to confirm that Subtenant is in compliance with all applicable maintenance and repair obligations set forth in the Lease. In the event that Sublandlord determines, in
Sublandlord&#146;s reasonable opinion, that Subtenant is in default of any maintenance and/or repair obligation set forth in the Lease which first arises after the Commencement Date, and such default may incur liability to Sublandlord upon the
surrender of the Subleased Premises upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease (a &#147;Required Repair Item&#148;), then Sublandlord shall have the right to notify Subtenant of any such Required Repair Items. Subtenant shall be

necessary to cure such Required Repair Items, so long as Subtenant has commenced such cure and diligently pursues such cure to completion. In no event shall Sublandlord&#146;s rights hereunder impose any additional and/or greater repair or
maintenance standards from those set forth in the Lease. In the event Subtenant fails to cure such Required Repair Items as set forth above, then such failure shall be deemed a default under this Sublease, entitling Sublandlord to exercise any of

terms of the Lease, remove all personal property and equipment (other than fixtures but including trade fixtures) from the Subleased Premises required to be removed from the Subleased Premises in accordance with the Lease. Upon such expiration,
Sublandlord and Subtenant shall schedule a walk-through of the Subleased Premises to determine whether Subtenant has complied with its obligation to surrender as set forth above. Sublandlord shall notify Subtenant of any perceived noncompliance at
the time of the walk-through. Sublandlord may forthwith re-enter the Subleased Premises following notice to Subtenant and repossess itself thereof and remove all persons and effects therefrom, using such force as may be reasonably necessary without
being guilty of forcible entry, detainer, trespass or other tort. Subtenant&#146;s obligation to observe or perform these covenants shall survive the expiration or other termination of the Sublease Term. </P>

final determination of taxability by the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;<U>IRS</U>&#148;) and loss of the interest deduction to Transferor under the Code. GPI acknowledges receipt of copies of the Financing Agreements and certain tax
