 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) _Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock_. Each Share that is owned by the Company and held in its treasury and each Share that is owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Shares_. Subject to _Section 3.1(d)_ and except as otherwise agreed to by the Company and a holder of Shares, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares), shall be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive in cash, without interest, $40.50 per Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, each such Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cancelled in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_ , and when so cancelled, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest. 

   

 (d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Any issued and outstanding Shares held by a Person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of approval of this Agreement and objects to the Merger and complies with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to dissent from the Merger and obtain payment for their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 3.1(c)_, but shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for payment or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of payment, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for payment of Dissenting Shares received by the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 (e) _Adjustment_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is a recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares (each, an " _Adjustment_ "), the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of Shares with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment. 

  

 Section 3.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall 

   ##### 

  

   

deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent
a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Funds made available to the Paying
Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Sub or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ _,_   _however_ , that
such investments shall only be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest
rating from MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation
or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three months (it being understood that any
and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to Parent). To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt
cash payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days thereof), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or the making of affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof). Each of Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares 

   ##### 

  

   

such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
payment of such consideration under the Code (and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder) or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent will mail to each holder of Shares represented by book-entry on the
records of the Company or the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent, on behalf of the
Company, other than Dissenting Shares, a check in the amount of the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Share so held. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, (i) holders of Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and (iii) there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article III_. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled, without interest. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash payment into which the Shares represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.2_ from and after the date hereof, the Company shall not, and the Company shall not give permission or authorize, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (such Persons, collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") not to (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into, participate, continue or otherwise engage in discussions or negotiations with respect to any inquiries regarding, or the making of, a Takeover Proposal, or (iii) approve any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to a Takeover Proposal. Subject to and not in limitation of the CompanyÂ’s rights under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this _Section 6.2_, if the Company becomes aware of a violation of any standstill or confidentiality agreement that the Company has entered into since January 1, 2007 in connection with such PersonÂ’s (other than Parent and Sub) consideration of a possible acquisition of the Company, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce the terms of such standstill or confidentiality agreement. The Company will request that each Person who has executed a confidentiality agreement since January 1, 2007 with the Company or its Affiliates in connection with that PersonÂ’s consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company return or destroy all non public information furnished to that Person by or on behalf of the Company, to the extent such confidentiality agreement provides for the return or destruction of such information. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(a)_, if, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company or any of the Company Representatives receives a written Takeover Proposal by any Person or group of Persons that was not initiated or solicited in violation of _Section 6.2(a)_, (A) the Company and Company Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside counsel, that (1) failure to take the following actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (2) the Takeover Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Company Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to a Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company to the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt by the Company of any Takeover Proposal, or of any request made to the Company for information or 

   ##### 

  

   

inquiry that could reasonably be expected to result in any Takeover Proposal
(in each case within 48 hours of receipt thereof), and the Company shall
provide to Parent (within such 48 hour time frame), at the CompanyÂ’s
option, either (i) a copy of any such Takeover Proposal made in writing
provided to the Company or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of
such Takeover Proposal and the name of the Person(s) that made the Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of any
material change to the terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal.
The Company agrees that it will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company
from providing such information to Parent. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon determination by the Company Board that a Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ and _(e)_ below, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether taken by the Company Board (or any committee thereof), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (iii) allow the Company to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar agreement or understanding (other than a Qualifying Confidentiality Agreement) to implement a Takeover Proposal (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding _Section 6.2(c)_, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.2(d)_ ) which was not solicited in violation of _Section 6.2(a)_, the Company Board may (x) in connection with such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) after complying with all of the provisions of _Section 7.4_, terminate this Agreement (and, subject to the proviso below, concurrently with or after such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal), if and only if in each such case the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable law, _provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (x) or exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (y) above unless: 

   

 (1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5) calendar days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action, which notice shall attach the most recent draft of any agreement with respect to, and specify the terms and conditions of, any such Superior Proposal and any material modifications to any of the foregoing, and 

   

 (2) during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the 

   ##### 

  

   

extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to
constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel) a Superior Proposal. 

 

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines such revisions
are material (it being understood that any change in the purchase price in
such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the Company
shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.2(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice. 

    

 (e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.2(c)_, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, other than in response to a Takeover Proposal and only in response to facts, circumstances or events first arising after the date of this Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable law. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) from (i) informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.2_, (ii) complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the case of this clause (iii), in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (or any committee thereof), after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the directorsÂ’ fiduciary obligations to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board (or any committee thereof) effects an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 Section 7.1 _Treatment of Stock-Based Awards_. 

   

 (a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option then outstanding, whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such cancellation from the Surviving Corporation in an amount (if any) equal to (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock 

   #####

(ii) all applicable federal, state, local and foreign Taxes required to be
withheld by the Surviving Corporation. The Company shall take all
necessary actions (including obtaining any required consents) to ensure that,
at the Effective Time, any Company Stock Option that is not cancelled by the

 (a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as soon as practicable (but in any case no later than 45 days) following mailing of the final Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the approval of this Agreement by the Company Requisite Vote (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The Company shall, through the Company Board (but subject to the right of the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as set forth in _Section 6.2_), recommend to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). 

   

 (b) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC as soon as practicable (but in any case no later than 15 Business Days) following the date hereof and shall use its reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC, and, to the extent permitted by law and subject to this _Section 7.2(b)_, to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders as 

   ##### 

  

   

promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments to the
satisfaction of the staff. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or
for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If at any time
prior to the Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement, in each case to the extent required by applicable law. Parent
shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement or making any other required filing with the SEC (including any
amendment or supplement) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response. The Company shall use its

The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish such supplemental information as may be necessary in order to cause the Proxy Statement to comply with applicable law after the mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company.

Upon reasonable notice and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 1, 2007, between the Company and GHEP, as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the Company shall afford to Parent and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records (including Tax records), customers and suppliers, and during such period, the Company shall make available to Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities laws or the federal Tax laws and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and information shall only be provided to the extent that such access or the provision of such information would not violate applicable law; or (ii) to disclose any attorney-client privileged information of the Company. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall be directed to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or such Person as may be designated by such officer. In no event shall the Company be required to supply to Parent, or ParentÂ’s officers, employees, accountants, counsel or other representatives, any information relating to indications of interest from, or discussions with, any other potential acquirors of the Company, except to the extent necessary for use in the Proxy Statement or as required by _Section 6.2_. In the event of a termination of this Agreement for any reason, Parent shall, in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, return or 

   ##### 

  

 

destroy, or cause to be returned or destroyed, all nonpublic information

Parent.

   ##### 

  

   

LLC all of GHEPÂ’s and ParentÂ’s costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees)
in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or Expenses, as the case
may be. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to the listing agreement with the Nasdaq Global Market. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Company and expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of Shares. 

  

 Section 7.7 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under state laws in the United States shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company and their respective boards of directors shall use reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_. 

   

 (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the exculpation from personal liability and indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six-year period, such provisions shall not be modified in a manner adverse to such individual until the final disposition of any such claims. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, and advance expenses to, each present and former director, officer, employee, agent or employee benefit plan fiduciary (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of the Company (including rights relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they are serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of another entity at the request of the Company) in respect of actions, omissions or events through the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company , any indemnification agreement set forth on Section 7.8 of the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company Letter or under applicable laws, in each case, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified PersonÂ’s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the applicable law, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company, or any
such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal
counsel jointly selected by such Indemnified Person and Parent. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Indemnified Person
becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding
or investigation covered by this _Section 7.8_ after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her
legal or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by
such Indemnified Person of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so
advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto
under the DGCL or other applicable law with respect to such proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.8(a)_,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation (i) shall be liable for any
settlement entered into by an Indemnified Person without ParentÂ’s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), and (ii) shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine
in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited
by applicable law. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification
under this _Section 7.8(a)_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving
Corporation of such claim and the relevant facts and circumstances with
respect thereto; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice
shall not affect the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices their
ability to defend such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the CompanyÂ’s officers and directors as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six years from the Closing Date in an amount and scope customary for companies similar in size and nature of operations to the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs, executors or similar representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is materially adverse to the Indemnified Persons (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. This _Section 7.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 7.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Sections 6.2_ and  _7.2_ , each of the Company, Parent and Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the consummation of the Merger as soon as practicable after 

   ##### 

  

 

the date hereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
without limiting the foregoing, (a) each of the Company, Parent and Sub
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on itself with respect to the Merger and shall promptly cooperate
with and furnish information to each other in connection with any such
requirements imposed upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and (b) each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its or their reasonable best efforts
to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity or other public or private third Person required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Sub, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby
or by this Agreement. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Antitrust Filing_. Each of Parent and the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. The Parent shall pay the applicable filing fees associated with such filing. 

  

 Section 7.11 _Financing_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Sub, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company to provide to Parent and Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary in connection with obtaining debt financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, the Company shall not be obligated to cause its officers and employees to devote more than the equivalent of three full business days of time per employee to such activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and Sub acknowledges and agrees that the receipt of financing is not a condition to their obligation to effect the Merger under _Article VIII_ hereof. 

  

 Section 7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable laws and the instructions of any applicable Governmental Entity, each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, from any third Person or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to a customary joint defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, nothing herein shall require either party to take any action that its outside counsel reasonably concludes would jeopardize the work product privilege or the attorney-client privilege. The Company shall not enter into any settlement of such litigation without ParentÂ’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   #####

Following the Effective Time, the Company Employees will for no less than 6 months be provided with, at a minimum (i) base salary and cash bonus opportunities which are no less than the base salary and cash bonus opportunities provided by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) retirement and welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding equity compensation opportunities) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company as of the date hereof pursuant to the Benefit Plans.

Nothing in this _Section 7.14_ or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or Company Employment Agreement or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.
