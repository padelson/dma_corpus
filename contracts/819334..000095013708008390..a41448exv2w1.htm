Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section

only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into
