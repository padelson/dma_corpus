1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the OGCL.

 



 

1.5 _Conversion of FirstMerit Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Huntington, FirstMerit,
Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

value, of FirstMerit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _FirstMerit Common Stock_ "), except for shares of FirstMerit Common
Stock owned by FirstMerit as treasury stock or otherwise owned by FirstMerit
or Huntington (in each case other than shares of FirstMerit Common Stock (i)
held in any FirstMerit Benefit Plans or related trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity and (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in respect of
debts previously contracted (collectively, the " _Exception Shares_ ")) and
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Agreement, into the right to receive, without interest, (i)
1.7200 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Huntington (the " _Huntington Common Stock_ ") and (ii) $5.00 in
cash (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in
clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) All of the shares of FirstMerit Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ,"
it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall
be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of FirstMerit Common Stock) previously representing
any such shares of FirstMerit Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of a
fractional share which the shares of FirstMerit Common Stock represented by
such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Old Certificates previously representing
shares of FirstMerit Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at
Huntingtons option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively,
referred to herein as " _New Certificates_ "), representing whole shares of
Huntington Common Stock and cash as set forth in Section 1.5(a) (together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon.
If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Huntington Common Stock or FirstMerit Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities, in any such case as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any
extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate
adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of
FirstMerit Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this sentence
shall be construed to permit Huntington or FirstMerit to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of FirstMerit Common Stock that are owned by
FirstMerit or Huntington (in each case other than the Exception Shares) or by
any direct or indirect FirstMerit Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and neither the Merger Consideration
nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

1.6 _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of FirstMerit Common Stock held by
a person (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of, or
consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the
provisions of the OGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of FirstMerit
Common Stock to require payment of the fair cash value of such FirstMerit
Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), in accordance with Sections
1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL, shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 1.5(a), but shall
become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
1701.85 of the OGCL. If such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws its demand for
fair cash value or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its rights as a
dissenting shareholder, in any case pursuant to the OGCL, each of such
Dissenting Shareholders shares of FirstMerit Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of FirstMerit Common
Stock had been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.5(a). FirstMerit shall promptly notify Huntington of
each shareholder who asserts rights as a Dissenting Shareholder following
receipt of such shareholders written demand delivered as provided in Section
1701.85 of the OGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, FirstMerit shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Huntington, voluntarily make any payment or
commit or agree to make any payment, or settle or commit or offer to settle,
any rights of a Dissenting Shareholder asserted under Section 1701.85 of the
OGCL.

 



 

1.7 _FirstMerit Preferred Stock_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of
the Second Step Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
thereof, each share of 5.875% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series
A, without par value, of FirstMerit (" _FirstMerit Preferred Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into the right to receive a share of a newly
created series of preferred stock of Huntington having such rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions,
taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to the holders
thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and
limitations and restrictions, taken as a whole, of the FirstMerit Preferred
Stock (all shares of each such newly created series, collectively, the " _New
Huntington Preferred Stock_ ") and, upon such conversion, the FirstMerit
Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Second Effective Time.

 



 

1.8 _Huntington Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of
Huntington Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

common stock of Merger Sub, without par value (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_
"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving
Company.

(a) At the Effective Time, (i) each option granted by FirstMerit to purchase
shares of FirstMerit Common Stock under a FirstMerit Stock Plan (as defined
below) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _FirstMerit Stock Option_ ") that has an exercise price per share
that is less than the Per FirstMerit Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall
be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (without
interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each Net Share covered by
such FirstMerit Stock Option, less applicable tax withholdings and (ii) each
FirstMerit Stock Option that has an exercise price per share that is greater
than or equal to the Per FirstMerit Share Cash Equivalent Consideration shall
be assumed and converted automatically into an option (an " _Adjusted Stock
Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such FirstMerit Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including vesting terms), the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Huntington Common
Stock) equal to the product of (A) the number of

 



      
 

 



 

shares of FirstMerit Common Stock subject to such FirstMerit Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted Stock Option shall have an exercise price per
share of Huntington Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) obtained _by dividing_ (1) the exercise price per share of
FirstMerit Common Stock subject to such FirstMerit Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of FirstMerit
Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted

granted prior to the date hereof, fully vest and be cancelled and converted

Consideration in respect of each share of FirstMerit Common Stock subject to
such FirstMerit Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, less applicable tax withholdings and (ii) if granted on or after the
date hereof, be assumed and converted into a restricted stock award of shares
of Huntington Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction (an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Award_ ") with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such FirstMerit Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms), and
relating to the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the
product of (A) the number of shares of FirstMerit Common Stock subject to such
FirstMerit Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_multiplied by_ (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded to the nearest whole Huntington Common Share.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of FirstMerit Common Stock granted under a FirstMerit Stock Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _FirstMerit
Restricted Stock Unit Award_ " and, together with the FirstMerit Stock Options
and the FirstMerit Restricted Stock Awards, the " _FirstMerit Equity Awards_
") shall (i) if granted prior to the date hereof, fully vest (with any
performance conditions deemed satisfied at maximum achievement) and be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive (without
interest) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of FirstMerit
Common Stock subject to such FirstMerit Restricted Stock Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable tax withholdings and
(ii) if granted on or after the date hereof, be assumed and converted into a
restricted stock unit award in respect of Huntington Common Stock (an "
_Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit Award_ ") with the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such FirstMerit Restricted Stock Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting terms) and relating
to the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of FirstMerit Common Stock subject to such FirstMerit
Restricted Stock Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_multiplied by_ (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional
shares rounded to the nearest whole Huntington Common Share.

 



 

(d) At the time of each payment provided under Section 1.10(a), Section
1.10(b) or Section 1.10(c), such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code with respect to the payment of the Merger
Consideration to be made in connection with the cancellation of a FirstMerit
Equity Award shall be applied first to reduce the portion of the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration that is payable in cash and then, only if and to the
extent that such withholding amount exceeds such cash portion, to reduce the
portion of the Merger Consideration that is payable in shares of Huntington
Common Stock (with the number of shares of Huntington Common Stock to be
withheld to be determined based on the closing price of a share of Huntington
Common Stock on the Closing Date).

 



 

(e) Each holder of a FirstMerit Equity Award converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration that would have otherwise been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Huntington Common Stock (after aggregating
all shares to be delivered in respect of all FirstMerit Equity Awards held by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash
payment (rounded to the nearest cent) (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Huntington Common Stock (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) multiplied by the
Huntington Share Closing Price (as defined below).

 



 

(f) Huntington shall pay the holders of FirstMerit Equity Awards the cash
payments described in Section 1.10 (a), Section 1.10(b), Section 1.10(c) and
Section 1.10(e), as applicable, through Huntingtons payroll as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement, any payment of Merger Consideration in respect of a FirstMerit
Restricted Stock Unit Award which immediately prior to such cancellation was
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement
date for such FirstMerit Restricted Stock Unit Award if required by the terms
of the applicable award agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(g) As of the Effective Time, Huntington shall file a post-effective amendment
to the Form S-4 or an effective registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the Huntington Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Stock Options,

resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.10.

following meanings:

 



 

(i) " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio
and (B) the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) obtained by dividing the

quotient obtained by dividing (a) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Per FirstMerit Share Cash Equivalent Consideration over the per share

of FirstMerit Common Stock subject to such FirstMerit Stock Option, by (b) the
Per FirstMerit Share Equivalent Cash Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) " _Per FirstMerit Share Cash Equivalent Consideration_ " means the sum

1.13 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Mergers, taken together,
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan

practicable following the Effective Time, in accordance with the General
Corporation Laws of the State of Maryland (the " _MGCL_ ") and the OGCL,
Huntington shall cause the Surviving Company to be merged with and into
Huntington in the Second Step Merger, with Huntington surviving the Second
Step Merger and continuing its existence under the laws of the State of

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 



 

2.1 _Huntington to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Huntington shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
a bank or trust company designated by Huntington and reasonably acceptable to
FirstMerit (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) New
Certificates to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of FirstMerit Common Stock,
and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of
the Merger Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares
(except for the New Certificates, Per Share Cash Consideration, or cash in
lieu of any fractional shares attributable to any Dissenting Shares) (such
cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b),
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Huntington,
_provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount
of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates and any
shortfall as a result of investment losses shall be promptly replenished by
Huntington. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Huntington.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than ten (10) days thereafter, Huntington shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing
shares of FirstMerit Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Old Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Huntington Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which the shares of FirstMerit
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as
well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b).
From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate
or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates, subject to Section
1.6, shall be entitled to receive in exchange

 



      
 

 



 

therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Huntington Common Stock to which such holder of FirstMerit
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article
I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II, (B) any cash in lieu of a fractional share which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (C)
any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to
receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the cash portion of the Merger Consideration or any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Subject to
Section 1.6, until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions
as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

 



 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Huntington
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance
with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Huntington
Common Stock which the shares of FirstMerit Common Stock represented by such
Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive (after giving
effect to Section 6.11).

 



 

(c) If any New Certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent
in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Huntington Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of FirstMerit of the shares of FirstMerit Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such Old Certificates is entitled to,
as provided in this Article II.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Huntington Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Huntington Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Huntington. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Huntington shall pay to each former shareholder of FirstMerit who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing sale prices of Huntington Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the
" _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five (5) full
trading days ending on the day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Huntington
Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Huntington Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.5.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of FirstMerit for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholders of FirstMerit who
have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Huntington Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each former share of FirstMerit Common Stock such shareholder holds
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Huntington, FirstMerit, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of FirstMerit Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Huntington shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Huntington Common
Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or
any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of FirstMerit Common Stock or FirstMerit Equity Awards such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Huntington or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of FirstMerit Common Stock in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made by Huntington or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be.

 



 

(h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Huntington, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Huntington
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will

 



      
 

 



 

issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FIRSTMERIT

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by FirstMerit to
Huntington concurrently herewith (the " _FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule as an exception to
a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by FirstMerit
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this Article III
shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article III
specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of this
Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any FirstMerit Reports publicly filed prior to the date hereof
(but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking
statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), FirstMerit hereby
represents and warrants to Huntington as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) FirstMerit is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Ohio and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC
Act_ "). FirstMerit has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects. FirstMerit is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FirstMerit. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Huntington, FirstMerit or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the
business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements, (B) changes, after the date
hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, or
interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after
the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of

 



      
 

 



 

war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit
and debt markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions affecting
the financial services industry generally and not specifically relating to
such party or its Subsidiaries, (D) failure, in and of itself, to meet
earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not including the
underlying causes thereof, (E) disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any effect on a partys relationship with its
customers or employees) or actions expressly required by this Agreement in
contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (F) actions or
omissions taken pursuant to the written consent of Huntington, in the case of
FirstMerit, or FirstMerit, in the case of Huntington; except, with respect to
subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the
industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability
of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As
used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ ," when used with respect to
any party, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes. True and
complete copies of the Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
of FirstMerit (the " _FirstMerit Articles_ ") and the Second Amended and
Restated Code of Regulations of FirstMerit (the " _FirstMerit Code of
Regulations_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by FirstMerit to Huntington.

 



 

(b) Except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) only, as would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FirstMerit, each Subsidiary of FirstMerit (a " _FirstMerit
Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and,
where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of FirstMerit to
pay dividends or distributions, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of FirstMerit that is an insured depository institution are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the
Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending
or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the
FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all
Subsidiaries of FirstMerit as of the date hereof.

(c) FirstMerit owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each of the
FirstMerit Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such

Subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, as provided under 12
U.S.C. § 55 or any comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No FirstMerit Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of
any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 



 

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) FirstMerit has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and

 



      
 

 



 

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly
and validly approved by the Board of Directors of FirstMerit. The Board of
Directors of FirstMerit has determined that the Merger, on the terms and

majority of the outstanding shares of FirstMerit Common Stock (the "
_Requisite FirstMerit Vote_ "), and the adoption and approval of the Bank
Merger Agreement by the board of directors of FirstMerit Bank and FirstMerit
as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
FirstMerit are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by FirstMerit and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Huntington) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of FirstMerit, enforceable against FirstMerit in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting insured
depository institutions or their parent companies or the rights of creditors
generally and subject to general principles of equity (the " _Enforceability
Exceptions_ ")).

 



 

(b) Subject to the receipt of the Requisite FirstMerit Vote, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by FirstMerit nor the consummation by
FirstMerit of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by
FirstMerit with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any
provision of the FirstMerit Articles or the FirstMerit Code of Regulations or
(ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section
3.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute, code,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which FirstMerit or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above)
for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
FirstMerit.

_Joint Proxy Statement_ "), and of the registration statement on Form S-4 in

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (ii)
any other United States or foreign securities exchange, futures exchange,
commodities exchange or contract market. As of the date hereof, FirstMerit is
not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank
Merger on a timely basis.

 



 

3.5 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) FirstMerit and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable) all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2013 with (i) any state
regulatory authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the
FDIC, (v) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (vi) any foreign
regulatory authority and (vii) any SRO ((i)  (vii), collectively, "
_Regulatory Agencies_ "), including any report, registration or statement
required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules
or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any
Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith, except where the failure to file such report,
registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit. Except for examinations of FirstMerit
and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course
of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, investigation into the business or

 



      
 

 



 

operations of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FirstMerit. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, which
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit.

 



 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013 (the " _FirstMerit Reports_ ")
is publicly available. No such FirstMerit Report, at the time filed, furnished
or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all FirstMerit Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of FirstMerit has failed in any
respect to make the certification required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding comments from or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with
respect to any of the FirstMerit Reports.

 



 

3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the FirstMerit Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of
FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved,
except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto.
The books and records of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries have been, since
January 1, 2013, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned (or informed FirstMerit that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
FirstMerit as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
FirstMerit on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit, neither FirstMerit
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet
of FirstMerit, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of FirstMerit included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of FirstMerit and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit.
FirstMerit (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to FirstMerit, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
FirstMerit by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii) has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to FirstMerits outside
auditors and the audit committee of FirstMerits Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect FirstMerits
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of FirstMerit, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
FirstMerits internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures
were made in writing by management to FirstMerits auditor and audit committee
and a copy has been previously made available to Huntington. To the knowledge
of FirstMerit, there is no reason to believe that FirstMerits outside
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, any director, officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of
FirstMerit, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that FirstMerit or any of
its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by FirstMerit or any of its officers, directors or
employees to the Board of Directors of FirstMerit or any committee thereof or,
to the knowledge of FirstMerit, to any director or officer of FirstMerit.

 



 

3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither FirstMerit nor any FirstMerit Subsidiary nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions

contemplated by this Agreement other than Sandler ONeill + Partners, L.P.

 



 

3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, FirstMerit
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course.

 



 

3.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit, or (ii) of a
material nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon FirstMerit, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of FirstMerit
or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Mergers, would
apply to Huntington or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be
expected to be material to either FirstMerit or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries.

 



 

3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Each of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax
Returns) that are due have been fully and

 



      
 

 



 

timely paid. Each of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent
contractor or other third party. Neither FirstMerit nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any material Tax that remains in effect. The federal income Tax
Returns of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including
December 31, 2011 have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "
_IRS_ ") or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for
assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to extensions or waivers,
has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed against FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries.
There are no pending or threatened (in writing) disputes, claims, audits,
examinations or other proceedings regarding any material Taxes of FirstMerit
and its Subsidiaries or the assets of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries. In the
last six years, neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
informed in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that
FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that
was not filed. FirstMerit has made available to Huntington true, correct, and
complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements or
gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in the
last six years. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet
due and payable) on any of the assets of FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries). Neither FirstMerit nor any of its
Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was FirstMerit) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither FirstMerit nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two years or otherwise as
part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Mergers are also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither
FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(1). At no time during the past five years has FirstMerit been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code.

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule lists all material
FirstMerit Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _FirstMerit
Benefit Plans_ " means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock

Qualified Plan and the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor
has revocation been threatened), and, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, there
are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would have a
material adverse effect on the qualified status of any FirstMerit Qualified
Plan or the related trust or increase the costs relating thereto.

in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, has (i) since
January 1, 2005, been maintained and operated, in all material respects, in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1 and

(vi) to the knowledge of FirstMerit, the most recent actuarial report for such
FirstMerit Benefit Plan is accurate in all material respects and (vii) there
does not exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived.

 



 

(g) None of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries nor any FirstMerit ERISA Affiliate
has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated
to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001 (a) (3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "), and none of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries nor any FirstMerit ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any material liability to a Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as
those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in
full.

 



 

(h) Neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored or
has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for
any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life insurance
benefits for retired or former employees or beneficiaries or dependents
thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 



 

(i) All material contributions required to be made to any FirstMerit Benefit
Plan by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any FirstMerit Benefit Plan, for any period in the
prior three years through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in
full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date
hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of FirstMerit.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, threatened (in
writing) claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the
knowledge of FirstMerit, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be
likely to give rise to a material claim or lawsuit, against the FirstMerit
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
FirstMerit Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
FirstMerit Benefit Plans that could in any case reasonably be likely to result
in any material liability of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries to the
PBGC, the IRS, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a FirstMerit Benefit Plan, or any other
party.

 



 

(k) None of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries nor any FirstMerit ERISA Affiliate
nor, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, any other person, including any
fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) which could subject any of the
FirstMerit Benefit Plans or their related trusts, FirstMerit, any of its
Subsidiaries, any FirstMerit ERISA Affiliate or any person that FirstMerit or
any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify to any material tax or
material penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.

 



 

(l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability, funding,
payment or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment, right
or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or independent contractor
of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the
right of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or FirstMerit ERISA Affiliates
to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any
FirstMerit Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in
the form of benefits) by FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof
or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will
be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code. FirstMerit has made available to Huntington preliminary copies of
Section 280G calculations with respect to any disqualified individual in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither FirstMerit nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to a rabbi trust or similar
funding vehicle, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
cause or require FirstMerit or any of its affiliates to establish or make any
contribution to a rabbi trust or similar funding vehicle.

 



 

(m) No FirstMerit Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code, or otherwise.

 



 

(n) Each voluntary employees beneficiary association (" _VEBA_ ") has been
determined by the IRS to be exempt from federal tax under Section 501(a) of
the Code, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the exempt status of any VEBA.

 



 

(o) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, threatened (in
writing) material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or
charges against

 



      
 

 



 

FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other material labor
disputes against FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither FirstMerit nor
any of its Subsidiaries are party to or bound by any collective bargaining or
similar agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices
agreed to with any labor organization or employee association applicable to
employees of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of
FirstMerit, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other group
seeking to represent any employees of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. FirstMerit and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit, and to the knowledge
of FirstMerit no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. FirstMerit and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries, including (to the extent applicable to FirstMerit or its
Subsidiaries) all laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT
Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B,
the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act and Regulation V, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E, the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act, any
regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Interagency Policy Statement on Retail
Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products, the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of
2008, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, and any
other law or regulation relating to bank secrecy, discriminatory lending,
financing or leasing practices, consumer protection, money laundering
prevention, foreign assets control, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal
Reserve Act and Regulation W, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all agency
requirements relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and
consumer loans. FirstMerit Bank has a Community Reinvestment Act rating of
"satisfactory" or better. FirstMerit and each of its affiliates and
subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under 12 U.S.C. § 1851 and the regulations
promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (together, " _Federal Banking Agencies_ ") in connection
therewith (the " _Volcker Rule_ "). Section 3.12 of the FirstMerit Disclosure
Schedule sets forth (i) all FirstMerit affiliates and subsidiaries (including
FirstMerit) engaged in proprietary trading (as defined in the Volcker Rule)
that would be prohibited upon expiration of any temporary conformance period
granted by the Federal Banking Agencies under the Volcker Rule and (ii) all
covered funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that FirstMerit or any of its
affiliates or subsidiaries sponsors or invests in that would be prohibited
upon expiration of any temporary conformance period granted by the Federal
Banking Agencies under

 



      
 

 



 

the Volcker Rule. For the purpose of the preceding two sentences, "
_affiliate_ " and " _subsidiary_ " shall have their respective meanings under
12 U.S.C. § 1813.

 



 

3.13 _Certain Contracts_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.13(a) of the FirstMerit Disclosure
Schedule or as filed with or incorporated into any FirstMerit Report filed
prior to the date hereof, as of the date hereof, neither FirstMerit nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding (whether written or oral), other than any
FirstMerit Benefit Plan, (i) that is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (ii) that contains a
non-compete or client or customer non-solicit requirement or any other
provision that materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by

materially restrict the ability of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries to
engage in any line of business that is material to FirstMerit and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) with or to a labor union or guild
(including any collective bargaining agreement), or (iv) that grants any right
of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right with respect to any
material assets, rights or properties of FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the
type described in this Section 3.13(a), whether or not set forth in the
FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a " _FirstMerit
Contract_ ," and neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or
has received written, or to the knowledge of FirstMerit, oral notice of, any
violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which would
reasonably be likely to be, either individually or in the aggregate, material
to FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) In each case, except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit: (i)
each FirstMerit Contract is valid and binding on FirstMerit or one of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) FirstMerit and
each of its Subsidiaries has performed all obligations required to be
performed by it prior to the date hereof under each FirstMerit Contract, (iii)
to the knowledge of FirstMerit each third-party counterparty to each
FirstMerit Contract has performed all obligations required to be performed by
it to date under such FirstMerit Contract, and (iv) no event or condition
exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will
constitute, a default on the part of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such FirstMerit Contract.

 



 

3.14 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither FirstMerit nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement
action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1,
2013, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2013,
has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or
suggestion of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or
that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to
pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its
business (each, whether

 



      
 

 



 

or not set forth in the FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule, a " _FirstMerit
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised in writing or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, orally, since January
1, 2013, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such FirstMerit
Regulatory Agreement.

 



 

3.15 _Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not reasonably be likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FirstMerit, all interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures
and forward contracts and other similar derivative transactions and risk
management arrangements, whether entered into for the account of FirstMerit or
any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a customer of FirstMerit or one
of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course of business and
in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of any
Regulatory Agency and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding obligations of
FirstMerit or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their
terms (except as may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions). FirstMerit
and each of its Subsidiaries has duly performed in all material respects all
of its material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued, and, to the knowledge of FirstMerit, there are no
material breaches, violations or defaults or _bona fide_ allegations or
assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 



 

3.16 _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
FirstMerit, FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and, since
January 1, 2013 have complied, with any federal, state or local law,
regulation, order, decree, permit, authorization, common law or legal
requirement relating to: (i) the protection or restoration of the environment,
health and safety as it relates to hazardous substance exposure or natural
resource damages, (ii) the handling, use, presence, disposal, release or
threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or (iii)
noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution, contamination or any injury to
persons or property from exposure to any hazardous substance (collectively, "
_Environmental Laws_ "). There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other
judicial proceedings, claims or actions, or, to the knowledge of FirstMerit,
any private environmental investigations or remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could
reasonably be likely to result in the imposition, on FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental
Law, pending or threatened against FirstMerit, which liability or obligation
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit. To the knowledge of FirstMerit, there
is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would
reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit. FirstMerit is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter agreement or memorandum of
agreement by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any
Environmental Law that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit.

(a) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FirstMerit, each of FirstMerit and its

since January 1, 2013, been in compliance with such policies, practices and
procedures in all material respects.

free and clear of all material Liens, except (i) statutory Liens securing

were made and continue to be in compliance with Regulation O or that are
exempt therefrom.

 



 

(f) Neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries is now, nor has it ever
been since December 31, 2012, subject to any material fine, suspension,
settlement or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction
in any loan purchase commitment, any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
FirstMerit, (a) FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of

industry practice, and neither FirstMerit nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice to the effect that any of them are in default under any
material insurance policy, (b) each such policy is outstanding and in full
force and effect and, except for policies insuring against potential
liabilities of officers, directors and employees of FirstMerit and its
Subsidiaries, FirstMerit or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole

under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been
filed in due and timely fashion.

ARTICLE IV

 



 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF HUNTINGTON AND MERGER SUB

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by Huntington and
Merger Sub to FirstMerit concurrently herewith (the " _Huntington Disclosure
Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth
as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not
result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
incorrect, (b) the mere inclusion of an item in the Huntington Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission by Huntington that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result
in a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of this Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of
this Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other
sections of this Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections
or (ii) as disclosed in any Huntington Reports publicly filed prior to the
date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Huntington
and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to FirstMerit as follows:

 



       
 

 



 

4.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) Huntington is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Maryland and is a bank holding company
duly registered under the BHC Act that has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company under the BHC Act. Merger Sub is a corporation duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Ohio. Each of Huntington and Merger Sub has the corporate power and authority
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Each of Huntington and
Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. True and
complete copies of the Articles of Restatement of Charter of Huntington, as
amended (" _Huntington Articles_ "), and Amended and Restated Bylaws of
Huntington (" _Huntington Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Huntington to FirstMerit.

 



 

(b) Except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) only, as would not
reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Huntington, each Subsidiary of Huntington (a " _Huntington
Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and,
where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all
jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership
or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Huntington to
pay dividends or distributions, except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a
regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally
applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each
Subsidiary of Huntington that is an insured depository institution are insured
by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted
by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of
such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of Huntington, threatened.

complete list of all Subsidiaries of Huntington as of the date hereof.

comparable provision of applicable state law) and free of preemptive rights,
with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Huntington
Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity

 



      
 

 



 

security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to

(a) Each of Huntington and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers have been duly and validly approved by the Board
of Directors of Huntington and of Merger Sub. The Board of Directors of
Huntington has determined that the Mergers, on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, are in the best interests of Huntington and its
shareholders, and has directed that the issuance of Huntington Common Stock in
connection with the Merger be submitted to its shareholders for approval at a
duly held meeting of such shareholders and has adopted resolutions to the
foregoing effect. The board of directors of Merger Sub has determined that the
Mergers, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, are in the
best interests of Merger Sub and its sole shareholder and has adopted a
resolution to the foregoing effect. Huntington, as Merger Subs sole
shareholder, has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby at a duly held meeting or by unanimous written consent. Except for (i)
the adoption and approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by the board of
directors of The Huntington National Bank and Huntington as its sole
shareholder, (ii) the approval of the issuance of Huntington Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement by a majority of the votes cast by holders of
outstanding Huntington Common Stock at the Huntington Meeting (the "
_Requisite Huntington Vote_ "), and (iii) the adoption of resolutions to give
effect to the provisions of Section 6.12 in connection with the Closing, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Huntington or Merger Sub are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Huntington and Merger Sub and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by FirstMerit) constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each of Huntington and Merger Sub, enforceable against
each of Huntington and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms (except in all
cases as such enforceability may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions).
Subject to the receipt of the Requisite Huntington Vote, the shares of
Huntington Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and the shares of New
Huntington Preferred Stock to be issued in the Second Step Merger have been
validly authorized and, when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and no current or past shareholder of Huntington will have any
preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) Subject to the receipt of the Requisite Huntington Vote, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Huntington or Merger Sub, nor the
consummation by Huntington or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor compliance by Huntington or Merger Sub with any of the terms or
provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Huntington Articles,
the Huntington Bylaws, the Merger Sub Articles, or the Merger Sub Code of
Regulations, or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings
referred to in Section 4.4 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law,
statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or
injunction applicable to Huntington, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets or (y) violate, conflict with,

both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a
right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective
properties or assets of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case
of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations which either
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 



 

4.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of applications,
filings and notices, as applicable, with the NASDAQ and/or the NYSE, (ii) the
filing of applications, filings and notices, as applicable, with the Federal
Reserve Board under the BHC Act and approval of such applications, filings and

any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Huntington of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Huntington
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Bank Merger). No consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any
Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with the execution and
delivery by Merger Sub of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, Huntington is
not aware of any reason why the necessary regulatory approvals and consents
will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Mergers and Bank
Merger on a timely basis.

 



 

4.5 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) Huntington and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January

 



      
 

 



 

1, 2013 with any Regulatory Agencies, including any report, registration or
statement required to be filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the
laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign
entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments due
and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure to file such
report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington. Except for examinations of Huntington
and its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course
of business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding
or, to the knowledge of Huntington, investigation into the business or
operations of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2013,
except where such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Huntington. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries, which
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 



 

(b) An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2013
(the " _Huntington Reports_ ") is publicly available. No such Huntington
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except
that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but before the date of
this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.
As of their respective dates, all Huntington Reports filed or furnished under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Huntington
has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her
under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material unresolved
issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Huntington Reports.

 



 

4.6 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The financial statements of Huntington and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Huntington Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Huntington and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders equity and consolidated financial position of
Huntington and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii)
complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared
in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case,
as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records
of Huntington and its Subsidiaries have been, since January 1, 2013, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any
other applicable legal and accounting requirements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has not resigned (or informed Huntington that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Huntington as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Huntington on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 



 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, neither Huntington
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any nature whatsoever
(whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated balance sheet
of FirstMerit, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of Huntington included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2015, or
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Huntington and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Huntington or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.
Huntington (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to Huntington, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
Huntington by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to Huntingtons outside auditors and the audit committee of
Huntingtons Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Huntingtons ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of
Huntington, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Huntingtons internal controls
over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management
to Huntingtons auditors and audit committee and a copy has been previously
made available to FirstMerit. To the knowledge of Huntington, there is no
reason to believe that Huntingtons outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Huntington nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of Huntington, any director, officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of
Huntington, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that Huntington or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by Huntington or any of its officers, directors, or
employees to the Board of Directors of Huntington or any committee thereof or,
to the knowledge of Huntington, to any director or officer of Huntington.

 



 

4.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Huntington nor any Huntington Subsidiary nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker, finder or
financial advisor or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions
or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than Goldman, Sachs and Co.

 



 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, no event or events have occurred that have had or
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Huntington.

 



 

(b) Since December 31, 2014, except with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required or permitted by this Agreement, Huntington
and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course.

 



 

4.9 _Legal Proceedings_.

 



 

(a) Neither Huntington nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Huntington, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental
or regulatory investigations of any nature against Huntington or any of its
Subsidiaries (i) that would reasonably be likely to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, or (ii) of a
material nature challenging the validity or propriety of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction
imposed upon Huntington, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Huntington
or any of its Subsidiaries (or that, upon consummation of the Merger, would
apply to Huntington or any of its affiliates) that would reasonably be
expected to be material to either Huntington or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



      
 

 



 

4.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. Each of Huntington and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all material
Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed
by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all
material respects. All material Taxes of Huntington and its Subsidiaries
(whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and
timely paid. Each of Huntington and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent
contractor or other third party. The federal income Tax Returns of Huntington
and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including December 31, 2011 have
been examined by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the
applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to
extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material
amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against Huntington or
any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened (in writing)
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Taxes of Huntington and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Huntington
and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

4.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Huntington and each of its Subsidiaries
hold, and have at all times since December 31, 2012 held, all licenses,
franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties,
rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where neither the
cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such license,
franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any fees or
assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Huntington, and to the knowledge
of Huntington, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license,
franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Huntington and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with and are not in
material default or violation under any law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Huntington or any of its
Subsidiaries, including (to the extent applicable to Huntington or its
Subsidiaries) all laws related to data protection or privacy, the USA PATRIOT
Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B,
the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act and Regulation V, the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, the Fair Debt Collection

any such action.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental Entities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in any
event within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, Huntington
and FirstMerit shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each
prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required in order to
obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Huntington and FirstMerit shall
each use, and shall each cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use,
reasonable best efforts to obtain each such Requisite Regulatory Approval and
any approvals required for the Bank Merger as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection
therewith (including the furnishing of any information and any reasonable
undertaking or commitments that may be required to obtain the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals) and shall respond as promptly as practicable to the
requests of Governmental Entities for documents and information. Huntington
and FirstMerit shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to FirstMerit or Huntington, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any
applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing and with
sufficient opportunity to comment, other than any portions of material filed
in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other
proprietary information filed under a claim of confidentiality (except any
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary information (but not any
confidential supervisory information) of FirstMerit that is necessary for
Huntington to prepare and file any applications, notices and filings required
in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that
Huntington shall request confidential treatment of any such information,
permit FirstMerit to control the defense of any challenge to such confidential
treatment request and will not release any such information publicly pursuant
to Freedom of Information Act requests or similar rules without FirstMerits
consent). The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult
with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party
and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Huntington
and FirstMerit shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible,
including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of businesses or assets of Huntington, FirstMerit and their
respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) Huntington and FirstMerit shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Huntington,
FirstMerit or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Huntington and FirstMerit agrees, as
to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if
any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the
Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the
date of mailing to the respective shareholders of FirstMerit or Huntington and
at the time of the Huntington Meeting and the FirstMerit Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading, and (iii) any applications, notices and filings required in order
to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will, at the time each is filed,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading. Each of Huntington and FirstMerit further agrees that if it
becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the
statements in the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the
S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement.

 



 

(e) Huntington and FirstMerit shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1, FirstMerit shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Huntington and its
Subsidiaries (including the furnishing of information and by making employees
reasonably available) as is reasonably requested by Huntington in order to
comply with the requirements of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing programs.

 



       
 

 



 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, each of Huntington
and FirstMerit, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, advisors and other representatives of the other party, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems,
and records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in
preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of
systems and business operations generally (including by entering into
customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such
service providers and/or the other party), and, during such period, during
normal business hours and in a manner so as not to interfere with normal
business operations, each of Huntington and FirstMerit shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with the other partys regular business
operations during any such access. Neither Huntington nor FirstMerit nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of Huntingtons or FirstMerits, as the case may be,
customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



 

(b) FirstMerit shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, on a monthly basis
provide Huntington with an update on the matters set forth in Section 6.2(b)
of the FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Each of Huntington and FirstMerit shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality
agreement, dated October 15, 2015, between Huntington and FirstMerit (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(d) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



      
 

 



 

6.3 _FirstMerit Shareholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) FirstMerit shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the
FirstMerit Articles and FirstMerit Code of Regulations, all actions necessary
to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the " _FirstMerit Meeting_ ") to be
held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for
the purpose of obtaining the Requisite FirstMerit Vote required in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger. Except in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of FirstMerit shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of FirstMerit the
Requisite FirstMerit Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. FirstMerit shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to Huntington to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
shareholders relating to the Requisite FirstMerit Vote. However, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of FirstMerit, after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it more likely
than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its
shareholders, the Board of Directors of FirstMerit may withhold or withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Huntington its recommendation to its
shareholders or may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (although the
resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of FirstMerit may
communicate the basis for its Adverse Recommendation Change to its
shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of FirstMerit may
not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Huntington at
least three (3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such
action is taken by the Board of Directors of FirstMerit in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions and the
identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment
or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or
circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of
Directors of FirstMerit takes into account any amendment or modification to
this Agreement proposed by Huntington and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than
not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred
to in this Section 6.3.

 



 

(b) Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change, FirstMerit shall
adjourn or postpone the FirstMerit Meeting, if, as of the time for which such
meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of FirstMerit
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such
meeting, FirstMerit has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite FirstMerit Vote. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the FirstMerit Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the

 



      
 

 



 

shareholders of FirstMerit at the FirstMerit Meeting, for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve FirstMerit of
such obligation. FirstMerit shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the
FirstMerit Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.3(b).

 



 

6.4 _Huntington Shareholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) The Board of Directors of Huntington has resolved to recommend to
Huntingtons stockholders that they approve the issuance of Huntington Common
Stock in connection with the Merger, and will submit to its shareholders the
proposed issuance of the Huntington Common Stock and any other matters
required to be approved by its shareholders in order to carry out the
intentions of this Agreement. Huntington shall duly take, in accordance with
applicable law, the Huntington Articles, and the Huntington Bylaws, all action
necessary to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Huntington Vote (the "
_Huntington Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of Huntington will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the Requisite
Huntington Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement). Huntington shall engage a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
FirstMerit to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating
to the Requisite Huntington Vote. FirstMerit and Huntington shall cooperate to
schedule and convene the FirstMerit Meeting and the Huntington Meeting on the
same date.

 



 

(b) Huntington shall adjourn or postpone the Huntington Meeting, if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of Huntington Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or
if on the date of such meeting, Huntington has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Huntington Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Huntington
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of Huntington at the Huntington Meeting, for the purpose of
voting on the adoption of this Agreement and the other matters contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Huntington of
such obligation. Huntington shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the
Huntington Meeting two (2) times pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 6.4(b).

 



 

6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of
this Agreement, each of Huntington and FirstMerit shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts, in each case as promptly
as practicable, (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the
Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by FirstMerit

 



      
 

 



 

or Huntington or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

6.6 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Huntington shall cause the shares of Huntington
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance prior to the Effective Time,
and the shares of the New Huntington Preferred Stock to be issued in the
Second Step Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE or the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance prior to the Second Effective Time.

 



 

6.7 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) Huntington shall provide the employees of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), for so long as they
are employed following the Effective Time, with the following: (i) during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016,
annual base salary or wages, as applicable, and target incentive opportunities
(including equity-based awards) that are no less than the annual base salary
or wages, as applicable, and target incentive opportunities in effect for each
such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) during the period
commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, annual base salary, wages and target incentive opportunities
(including equity-based awards) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Huntington and
its Subsidiaries, and (iii) during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Huntington and its Subsidiaries (excluding any frozen
benefit plans of Huntington and its Subsidiaries or benefit plans that
exclusively provide benefits to grandfathered employees of Huntington and its
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that until such time as Huntington fully
integrates the Continuing Employees into its plans, participation in the
FirstMerit Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing standards,
it being understood that the Continuing Employees may commence participating
in the plans of Huntington on different dates following the Effective Time
with respect to different benefit plans. For a period beginning at the
Effective Time and continuing through the first anniversary thereof,
Huntington or its Subsidiaries shall provide severance to each Continuing
Employee of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the severance plan or policy of FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries
applicable to such Continuing Employees as of the date hereof (as set forth on
Section 6.7(a) of the FirstMerit Disclosure Schedule); _provided_ that (A)
such severance shall be subject to the execution (and non-revocation) of a
customary release of claims and (B) such severance may be paid in a lump sum.

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Huntington or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Huntington and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive all pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous FirstMerit Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their
eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or

 



      
 

 



 

coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a
FirstMerit Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits (including medical,
dental and vision), to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous FirstMerit Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, in satisfying
any applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such
employees with FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New
Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous FirstMerit Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service, (B)
for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan, or (C) for purposes of any
benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

 



 

(c) Huntington agrees to assume and honor all FirstMerit Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as of the date hereof, it being understood that
this sentence shall not be construed to limit the ability of Huntington or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend or terminate any FirstMerit Benefit
Plan to the extent that such amendment or termination is permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan.

 



 

(d) If requested by Huntington in writing at least twenty (20) business days
prior to the Effective Time, FirstMerit shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored
or maintained by FirstMerit (the " _FirstMerit_ ___401(k)_ ___Plan_ ") to be
terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Huntington
requests that any FirstMerit 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective
Time, in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by Huntington or one of its
Subsidiaries (a " _Huntington_ ___401(k)_ ___Plan_ "). FirstMerit and
Huntington shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the FirstMerit 401(k) Plan and/or Huntington 401(k) Plan to
permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively employed to make
rollover contributions to the Huntington 401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover
distributions" (with the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof.
FirstMerit shall provide Huntington with evidence that the FirstMerit 401(k)
Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this
Section 6.7(d); _provided_ , that prior to amending or terminating the
FirstMerit 401(k) Plan, FirstMerit shall provide the form and substance of any
applicable resolutions or amendments to Huntington for review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(e) On and after the date hereof, any broad-based employee notices or
communication materials (including any website posting) with respect to
employment, compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or
related, directly or indirectly, to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to the prior prompt review and comment of the other
party, and the party seeking to distribute any such notice or communication
shall consider in good faith revising such notice or communication to reflect
any comments or advice that the other party timely provides.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in

 



      
 

 



 

the employ or service of the Surviving Company, FirstMerit, Huntington, or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any
way the rights of the Surviving Company, FirstMerit, Huntington or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any
employee, officer, director or consultant of FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any FirstMerit Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Huntington or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any particular FirstMerit Benefit Plan, New Plan or any
other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Huntington and the Surviving
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of
FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of FirstMerit or any of its
Subsidiaries under FirstMerit Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _FirstMerit Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary of
FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries or under any FirstMerit Benefit Plans or
(ii) matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the consideration and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Huntington and the
Surviving Company shall also advance expenses as incurred by such FirstMerit
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law;
_provided_ , that the FirstMerit Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such FirstMerit Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Huntington shall
maintain in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries and any similar
policies covering fiduciaries under the FirstMerit Benefit Plans ( _provided_
, that Huntington may substitute therefor policies with a substantially
comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of FirstMerit or
any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Huntington shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid as of the date hereof by

 



      
 

 



 

FirstMerit for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums
for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Huntington
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in Huntingtons good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, FirstMerit, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of Huntington, may (and at the
request of Huntington, FirstMerit shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under
FirstMerits existing directors and officers insurance policy and similar
policy covering fiduciaries under the FirstMerit Benefit Plans providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed, on an annual basis, the Premium Cap. If a "tail policy" is
purchased as provided above, Huntington shall maintain in full force and
effect and not cancel such "tail policy".

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
FirstMerit Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
Huntington, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages
in any similar transaction, then in each case, Huntington or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Huntington or the Surviving Company will expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8. For the avoidance of
doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously entered into by
FirstMerit in connection with a merger, acquisition or other business
combination, the provisions of this Section 6.8 shall apply to directors,
officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor entities previously
acquired by FirstMerit or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The obligations of the Surviving Company, Huntington and FirstMerit under
this Section 6.8 shall not be terminated or modified in a manner so as to
adversely affect any FirstMerit Indemnified Party or any other person entitled
to the benefit of this Section 6.8 without the prior written consent of the
affected FirstMerit Indemnified Party.

 



 

6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest Huntington or the Surviving Company with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Mergers, the then current officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or cause
to be taken, all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the
other party, at the expense of the party who makes any such request.

 



 

6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Huntington and FirstMerit shall each promptly advise
the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it (i)
that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it
or (ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise,
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article
VII; _provided_ , that any

 



      
 

 



 

failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.10 or
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied,
or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to
give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied.

 



 

6.11 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Huntington and
FirstMerit shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Huntington Common Stock and FirstMerit Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of FirstMerit Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of FirstMerit Common Stock and any shares of Huntington Common
Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. In
furtherance of the foregoing, (i) starting with the second quarter of 2016,
the Board of Directors of FirstMerit shall cause its regular quarterly

Board of Directors of FirstMerit other than the FirstMerit Directors to become
members of Huntingtons existing Greater Akron-Canton Region Advisory Board
(the " _Advisory Board_ "), and shall cause all such individuals who accept
such invitation to be elected or appointed as members of the Advisory Board.
Such members of the Advisory Board who are not employees

 



      
 

 



 

of Huntington or its Subsidiaries or members of the Board of Directors of
Huntington will serve on the Advisory Board until at least the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date or until their earlier death or resignation,

of ten (10) years following the Closing Date (the " _Contribution Period_ "),
Huntington shall ratably contribute to the Foundation an amount in cash equal
to $20 million to support, in a manner consistent with Huntingtons giving
charitable guidelines, community development and reinvestment, civic and
charitable activities in the greater Akron area. There shall be three (3)
initial members of the board of trustees of the Foundation selected by the
Board of Directors of Huntington prior to the Closing Date, including one (1)
member of the pre-Closing board of directors of Huntington and two (2) former
FirstMerit directors domiciled in the greater Akron area who become Huntington
directors at Closing. Huntington shall also contribute $5 million over the
Contribution Period to The Huntington Foundation, dedicated to supporting
community development and reinvestment, civic and charitable activities in the
greater Canton, Ohio and Flint, Michigan areas.

 



 

(d) From and after the date hereof, the parties shall plan for the

Akron consistent with FirstMerits employment levels in Akron as of the
Closing Date. In addition, Huntington will provide FirstMerit employees who
would otherwise be terminated as a result of the Merger with priority access
to job listings throughout all of Huntingtons and FirstMerits combined
areas.

 



 

6.13 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) FirstMerit shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to,
any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that, prior to the receipt of the
Requisite FirstMerit Vote, in the event FirstMerit receives an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or
cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel,
and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to
take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a violation of
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant
to

 



      
 

 



 

the foregoing proviso, FirstMerit shall have provided such information to
Huntington, and shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such
third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with
any exclusive right to negotiate with FirstMerit. FirstMerit will, and will
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Huntington with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. FirstMerit will promptly (and in any event within one
(1) business day) advise Huntington following receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms
and conditions of and the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal), and will keep Huntington reasonably apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. FirstMerit shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to
applicable law and the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
FirstMerit, to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms
thereof. During the term of this Agreement, FirstMerit shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors
and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, or other definitive transaction agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance
with this Section 6.13(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. As used in
this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer or proposal relating
to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of
FirstMerit and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated assets of
FirstMerit, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in such third party beneficially owning more than 25% of any
class of equity or voting securities of FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the
consolidated assets of FirstMerit, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange or other business combination, reorganization involving FirstMerit or
its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
more than 25% of the consolidated assets of FirstMerit, except, in each case,
any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business
and any _bona fide_ internal reorganization.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent FirstMerit or its Board
of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or from making any legally required disclosure to FirstMerits stockholders;
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

 



 

6.14 _Public Announcements_. FirstMerit and Huntington shall each use their
reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan, (b) to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and (c) except in respect of any announcement

 



      
 

 



 

required by (i) applicable law or regulation, (ii) a request by a Governmental
Entity, (iii) communications that are substantially similar to communications
previously approved pursuant to this Section 6.14, (iv) communications
permitted by Section 6.3 or Section 6.13 or (v) an obligation pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, FirstMerit and
Huntington agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval
of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent
practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.15 _Change of Method_. Huntington may at any time change the method of
effecting the Mergers if and to the extent requested by Huntington, and
FirstMerit agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as
Huntington may reasonably request in order to give effect to such
restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall
(i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers
with respect to FirstMerits shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to
cause the Closing to be materially delayed or the receipt of the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

 



 

6.16 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either FirstMerit or Huntington shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite FirstMerit Vote or the Requisite Huntington
Vote at the duly convened FirstMerit Meeting or Huntington Meeting, as
applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties
shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a
restructuring of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no party shall have any obligation to agree to (i) alter or
change any material term of this Agreement, including the amount or kind of
the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party or its
shareholders or (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with
respect to FirstMerits shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section
6.16) to its shareholders for approval or adoption.

 



 

6.17 _Takeover Statutes_. Neither FirstMerit nor Huntington shall take any
action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each of Huntington and FirstMerit shall take all necessary steps to exempt
(or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Huntington and FirstMerit
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



 

6.18 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. FirstMerit and
Huntington agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
those officers and directors of FirstMerit subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _FirstMerit Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that FirstMerit Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of FirstMerit
Common Stock and FirstMerit Equity Awards in the Merger and FirstMerit
Preferred Stock in the Second Step Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.18. The Boards of
Directors of Huntington and of FirstMerit, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly after the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to (i) the Effective Time, take all such steps as may
be necessary or appropriate to cause (x) any dispositions of FirstMerit Common
Stock or FirstMerit Equity Awards and (y) any acquisitions of Huntington
Common Stock and (ii) the Second Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause (x) any dispositions of FirstMerit Preferred
Stock and (y) any acquisitions of New Huntington Preferred Stock, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any
FirstMerit Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of Huntington or of the Surviving Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

 



 

6.19 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Huntington and FirstMerit shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing,
investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced,
brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving, any
Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Huntington
or FirstMerit, as applicable, threatened against Huntington, FirstMerit or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement
or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or
to be taken by Huntington, FirstMerit, or their respective Subsidiaries with
respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. FirstMerit shall give Huntington
the opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement
of any shareholder litigation against FirstMerit and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no
such settlement shall be agreed without Huntingtons prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

6.20 _Assumption of FirstMerit Debt_. Huntington agrees to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Huntington,
the Surviving Company or The Huntington National Bank (as the case may be), at
or prior to the Second Effective Time or at or prior to the effective time for
the Bank Merger for any debt of FirstMerit Bank, one or more supplemental
indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption
of FirstMerits or the FirstMerit Banks outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such
debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 



 

6.21 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Huntington, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of FirstMerit or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement shall give FirstMerit, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of Huntington or its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Huntington and
FirstMerit shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
shareholders of FirstMerit:

 



 

(a) by mutual consent of Huntington and FirstMerit in a written instrument;

 



 

(b) by either Huntington or FirstMerit if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 



 

(c) by either Huntington or FirstMerit if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set
forth herein;

 



 

(d) by either Huntington or FirstMerit ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of FirstMerit, in the case of a termination by
Huntington, or Huntington, in the case of a termination by FirstMerit, which
breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the
Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section
7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the
Termination Date and 45 days following written notice to FirstMerit, in the
case of a termination by Huntington, or Huntington, in the case of a
termination by FirstMerit, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during
such period; or

 



 

(e) by Huntington, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite FirstMerit Vote

otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its
intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation
as contemplated by Section 6.3(a), or recommends to its shareholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its
obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.13; or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 20% or more of the

 



      
 

 



 

outstanding shares of FirstMerit Common Stock is commenced (other than by
Huntington or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of FirstMerit
recommends that the shareholders of FirstMerit tender their shares in such
tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such
shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10)
business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(c) and
this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Huntington nor FirstMerit shall be relieved or released
from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of
FirstMerit, shall include the loss to the holders of FirstMerit Common Stock
of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium
offered to the shareholders of FirstMerit).

 



 

(i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
termination of this Agreement, a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made known to senior management of FirstMerit or shall have been made
directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal with respect
to FirstMerit and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Huntington or FirstMerit pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite
FirstMerit Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by Huntington pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, FirstMerit
enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect

shall, on the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Huntington, by
wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $100,600,000 (the "

thereafter).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees

 



      
 

 



 

payable by FirstMerit under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination
Fee. In no event shall FirstMerit be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) Each of Huntington and FirstMerit acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other
party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if FirstMerit fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Huntington commences a suit which results in a judgment
against FirstMerit for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, FirstMerit
shall pay the costs and expenses of Huntington (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
FirstMerit fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then
FirstMerit shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in
full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan
Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such
payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by
FirstMerit pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) constitute liquidated damages and not
a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach,
shall be the sole monetary remedy of Huntington in the event of a termination
of this Agreement specified in such section.

warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such

instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. Except as provided in Section 6.8, notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement
of any third-party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would

 



      
 

 



 

be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 



 

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

branches of FirstMerit Bank existing as of the Effective Time as branches of
the Surviving Bank at the officially designated address of each such office or
branch and shall continue to operate each of the branches of the Surviving
Bank existing at the Effective Time, in each case without limiting the
authority under applicable law of The Huntington National Bank or of the

"The Huntington National Bank" and the main office of the Surviving Bank shall
be at 17 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215.
