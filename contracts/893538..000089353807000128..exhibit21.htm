**ARTICLE  2**

 

Purchase  Price

 



 

 

**Section  2.01** _Purchase  Price_.

 

 

The  total consideration for the purchase, sale and conveyance of the Assets
to  Buyer  and Buyer's assumption of the Assumed Obligations and all other
liabilities  provided for in this Agreement, is Buyer's payment to Seller of
the sum of One  Hundred Fifty-Three Million One Hundred One Thousand Eight
Hundred Forty-Six  and  06/100 Dollars ($153,101,846.06) (the " _Purchase
Price_ "), as adjusted in  accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

**Section  2.02** _Deposit_.

 

 



 

 

(a) Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement by Buyer and Seller,
Buyer shall deliver  to  Seller in immediately available funds a performance
guarantee deposit in an  amount equal to Fifteen Million Three Hundred Ten
Thousand One Hundred  Eighty-Four and 61/100 Dollars ($15,310,184.61) (the "
_Deposit_ ") in  accordance with wire transfer instructions provided by
Seller to Buyer. 

 

 

(b) If  all  conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
_Article 9_   have been met and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not  consummated on or before the Closing Date because of the
failure of Buyer to  perform any of its material obligations hereunder, then
in such event Seller  shall, unless Seller elects to waive such failure of
performance, terminate  this  Agreement, in which case Seller shall retain
the Deposit as liquidated damages,  which remedy shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to Seller for  Buyer's failure to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. Buyer and  Seller acknowledge and agree
that (i) Seller's actual damages upon the  event of such a termination are
difficult to ascertain with any certainty,  (ii) the Deposit is a reasonable
estimate of such actual damages, and  (iii) such liquidated damages do not
constitute a penalty.

 

 

(c) If  this  Agreement is terminated (i) by the mutual written agreement of
Buyer and Seller,  or (ii) pursuant to the provisions of _Article 11_
(subject to the  limitations in _Article 11_ ) or if the Closing does not
occur on or before  the Closing Date for any reason other than Buyer's
failure to perform its  material obligations hereunder, then Seller shall
return the Deposit to Buyer  in  immediately available funds pursuant to
wire transfer instructions to be  provided timely by Buyer to Seller within
three (3) business days after the  event giving rise to such return
obligation. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon  have the rights and obligations
set forth elsewhere herein.

 

 

(d) If  all conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in
_Article  8_ have been met, then notwithstanding any provision in this
Section 2.02  to  the contrary, if Closing does not occur because Seller
wrongfully fails to  tender performance at Closing or otherwise breaches this
Agreement in any  material respect prior to Closing, and Buyer is ready and
otherwise able to  close, at Buyer's sole election, either (i) Seller shall
return the Deposit to  Buyer within 15 days after the determination that the
Closing will not occur,  or  (ii) Buyer shall have the right to pursue
specific performance of this  Agreement, provided that Buyer must file an
action for specific performance  within 21 days of Seller's breach. If Buyer
elects to pursue specific  performance, Buyer must pursue specific
performance as its sole and exclusive  remedy in lieu of all other legal and
equitable remedies. If such  action for specific performance is not filed
within 21 days of Seller's breach  or if Buyer is unsuccessful for any reason
other than a material breach of  this  Agreement by Buyer, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived all legal and equitable  remedies and its sole remedy
for Seller's breach of this Agreement shall be  limited to the prompt return
of the Deposit.

 

 

(e) If  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated,
the Deposit shall  be returned by Seller to Buyer in connection with the
Closing, and the amount  payable by Buyer at the Closing shall not be reduced
by the amount of the  Deposit.

 

 

**Section  2.03** _Allocated  Values_.

 

 

The  Purchase Price is allocated among the Assets (including the Wells, PUD 
Locations, PDNP, Probable and/or Possible Locations) and the Undeveloped
Acreage  specifically described on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Undeveloped Acreage_
") as  set forth in _Exhibit D-1_ and _Exhibit D-2_ (the " _Allocated 
Values_ "). In no event shall the aggregate of the Allocated Values of any 
Wells, PUD Locations, PDNP, Probable and/or Possible Locations and
Undeveloped  Acreage exceed the unadjusted Purchase Price. The term " _PUD
Locations_ " means those Proved Undeveloped potential well locations
identified  in  _Exhibit D-2_. The term " _PDNP_ " means Proved  Developed
Not Producing, as identified on _Exhibit D-2_. The term " _Probable and/or
Possible Locations_ " means those locations  designated as such on _Exhibit
D-2_. Seller and Buyer agree that  the Allocated Values shall be used to
compute any adjustments to the Purchase  Price pursuant to the provisions of
_Article 4_. For purposes of  this Agreement, the Parties agree that the
Allocated Value for the Undeveloped  Acreage shall be Eighty Dollars ($80.00)
per net acre. Any adjustment  to the Purchase Price hereunder shall be
reflected in the allocation hereunder  consistent with Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1060-IT (f). For tax  purposes, the Parties agree to report the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including  the  allocations set forth above as of
the Closing Date, and that neither Party  will  take any position
inconsistent therewith, including in any tax return, in any  refund claim, in
any litigation or arbitration or otherwise.

 

 

**Section  2.04** _Section  1031 Like-Kind_ _ ____Exchange_.

 

 

Seller  and Buyer hereby agree that Seller shall have the right at any time
prior to  completion of all the transactions that are to occur at Closing to
assign all  or  a portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary (as  that term is defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the
Treasury  Regulations) in order to accomplish the transaction in a manner
that will  comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a
like-kind  exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as  amended. Likewise, Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to
completion  of  all the transactions that are to occur at Closing to assign
all or a portion  of  its rights under this Agreement to a Qualified
Intermediary for the same  purpose. If Seller assigns all or any of its
rights under this Agreement for  this purpose, Buyer agrees to (a) consent to
Seller's assignment of its rights  in this Agreement, which assignment shall
be in a form reasonably acceptable  to  Buyer, and (b) pay the Purchase
Price (or a designated portion thereof as  specified by Seller) into a
qualified escrow or qualified trust account at  Closing as directed in
writing. If Buyer assigns all or any of its rights under  this Agreement for
this purpose, Seller agrees to (i) consent to Buyer's  assignment of its
rights in this Agreement, which assignment shall be in a  form  reasonably
acceptable to Seller, (ii) accept the Purchase Price from the  qualified
escrow or qualified trust account at Closing, and (iii) at Closing,  convey
and assign directly to Buyer the Assets (or any portion thereof) as  directed
by Buyer. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that any assignment  of 
this Agreement (or any rights hereunder) to a Qualified Intermediary  shall
not release any Party from any of its respective liabilities and  obligations
hereunder, and that neither Party represents to the other Party  that  any
particular tax treatment will be given to any Party as a result  thereof.

 

 

**ARTICLE  3**

 

Effective  Time

 



 

**Section  3.01** _Ownership  of Assets_.

 

 

If  the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated in accordance with
the  terms and provisions hereof, the ownership of the Assets shall be
transferred  from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date, but effective for all
purposes as  of  7:00 a.m. local time at the location of the Assets on July
1, 2007 (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

 

**Section  3.02** _Production  Imbalances_.

 

 

Upon  Closing, Buyer shall succeed to and assume the positions of Seller with
respect  to all gas imbalances and make-up obligations related to the Assets
regardless  of whether such imbalances or make-up obligations arise before or
after the  Effective Time, at the wellhead, pipeline, gathering system or
other location,  and regardless of whether the same arise under contract or
otherwise  (" _Production Imbalances_ "). As a result of such succession,
Buyer shall  (a) be entitled to receive any and all benefits which Seller
would have been  entitled to receive by virtue of its position, including
rights to produce  and  receive volumes of production in excess of volumes
which it would otherwise  have  been entitled to produce and to receive cash
gas balancing by virtue of  ownership of the Assets; (b) be obligated to
suffer any detriments or losses  which Seller would have been obligated to
suffer by virtue of such position,  including the obligation to deliver to
others production volumes which would  have otherwise been attributable to
its ownership of the Assets, to deliver  production to purchasers thereof
without Buyer receiving full payment therefor,  or to make cash balancing
payments or to repay any take or pay payments, and  (c)  be responsible for
any and all royalty obligations and other burdens with  respect to such
Production Imbalances; provided however, nothing in this  subsection (c) of
Section 3.02 shall relieve Seller from any royalty obligation  affecting
production Seller has actually received, or which has been credited  to 
Seller's interest in the Assets.

 

 

**ARTICLE  4**

 

Title  and  Environmental Matters

 



 

**Section  4.01** _Examination  Peri_ _od_.

 

 

Until  5:00 p.m. CST on September 7, 2007 (the " _Examination Period_ "),
Seller  shall permit Buyer and/or its representatives to examine during
normal business  days and hours at a location in Tulsa, Oklahoma, designated
by Seller, all  abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, ownership
maps, lease, Well  and  division order files, assignments, operating and
accounting records and all  Surface Agreements, Permits, Contracts and other
agreements pertaining to the  Assets insofar as same may now be in existence
and in the possession of Seller,  subject to such restrictions upon
disclosure as may exist under confidentiality  or other agreements binding
upon Seller or such data.

 

 

**Section  4.02** _Title  Defects_.

 

 

The  term " _Title Defect_ " means (a) any encumbrance on, encroachment on, 
irregularity in, defect in or objection to Seller's ownership of the Assets 
(excluding Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller not to have Marketable 
Title to a Well, a PUD Location, a PDNP or a Probable and/or Possible
Location  as described in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable); or
(b)  any default by Seller under a lease, farmout agreement or other contract
or  agreement that would (i) have a material and adverse effect on the
operation,  value or use of such Asset, (ii) prevent Seller from receiving
the proceeds  of  production attributable to Seller's interest therein, or
(iii) result in  cancellation of all or a portion of Seller's interest
therein. Subject to the  terms of _Section 4.03_ , the term " _Marketable
Title_ " means such  ownership by Seller in the Assets that, subject to and
except for the Permitted  Encumbrances:

 

 

(a) entitles  Seller to receive not less than the percentage set forth in
_Exhibit D-1_   or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable) as Seller's Net Revenue
Interest of all  Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from such Well,
PUD Location, PDNP  or  Probable and/or Possible Locations described in
either of such exhibits, all  without reduction, suspension or termination of
such interest throughout the  productive life of such Well, except as
specifically set forth in either of  such  exhibits;

 

 

(b) obligates  Seller to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in 
_Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable) as Seller's  Working Interest
of the costs and expenses relating to the maintenance,  development and
operation of such Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or  Possible
Locations, all without increase throughout the productive life of  such 
Well, except as specifically set forth in either of such exhibits;

 

 

(c) is  free  and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects in title; and

 

 

(d) subject  to the limitations of _Section 4.15_ , breaches of Seller's
representations  and warranties contained in _Section 5.07_ through _Section
5.22_   shall be treated as Title Defects.

 

 

**Section  4.03** _Undeveloped  Acreage Marketable Title_.

 

 

The  term Marketable Title with respect to the Undeveloped Acreage as
specifically  described and identified on _Exhibit A_ shall mean that:

 

 

(a) Seller's  ownership in the Undeveloped Acreage is not less than the net
acres ascribed  to  each of such Undeveloped Acreage in _Exhibit A_ ; and

 

 

(b) Seller's  ownership in the Undeveloped Acreage, subject to Permitted
Encumbrances, is  free  and clear of all liens and encumbrances.

 

 

In  calculating any remedy or termination right under this _Article 4_ ,
the  term Title Defect shall include Title Defects with respect to any of
the  Undeveloped Acreage. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 4.04_
to  the contrary, in the event a Title Defect affecting Undeveloped Acreage
results  from Seller's ownership being less than the net acres shown on
_Exhibit A_   for the affected Asset, the Title Defect Value of any such
Undeveloped Acreage  shall be an amount equal to the product of the
applicable Allocated Value of  the  affected Undeveloped Acreage multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator being  the  actual net acres of the subject
Undeveloped Acreage, and the denominator being  the net acres shown on
_Exhibit A_. Except as set forth in this _Section  4.03_ , the terms and
provisions of _Article 4_ shall apply _Mutatis  Mutandis_ to Title Defects
and Title Defect Values of any Undeveloped  Acreage. In applying the
provisions of _Article 4_ to the Undeveloped  Acreage, the term "Net Revenue
Interest" shall be substituted by the term "net  acres", whether or not
capitalized.

 

 

**Section  4.04** _Notice  of Title Defects_.

 

 

Buyer  shall provide Seller notice of all Title Defects no later than 5:00
p.m. CDT  on  September 7, 2007; provided, however, if during the
Examination Period, Buyer  discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset,
Buyer shall promptly notify  Seller of such alleged Title Defect. To be
effective, such notice must (a)  be in  writing, (b) be received by Seller
prior to the expiration of the Examination  Period, (c) describe the Title
Defect in sufficient, specific detail (including  any alleged variance in the
Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest), (d)  identify the specific Asset
or Assets affected by such Title Defect, (e) include  the Title Defect Value,
as reasonably determined by Buyer in good faith, and  (f)  comply with the
limitations and Title Defect Value qualifications set forth  in  _Section
4.15_. Any matters identified by Buyer during the Examination  Period that
constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been  specifically
notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed  to have
been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted 
Encumbrances and Assumed Obligations hereunder. Upon receipt of notices of 
Title  Defects, the Parties shall meet and determine upon which of the Title
Defects,  Title Defect Values and methods of cure the Parties have reached
agreement.  Upon  the receipt of such effective notice from Buyer, Seller
shall have the option,  but not the obligation, for a period ending ninety
(90) days after the Closing  to cure such defect. If Seller should not elect
to cure a Title Defect, and  no  aspect of such defect is reasonably in
dispute, the Purchase Price shall be  adjusted for such defect by the amount
of the Title Defect Value.

 

 

(a) The  value  attributable to each Title Defect (the " _Title Defect
Value_ ") that is  asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall be
determined based upon  the  criteria set forth below:

 

 

(i) If  the  Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset, the Title Defect Value
is the amount  necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected
Asset;

 

 

(ii) If  the  Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest
attributable to any  Well,  PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible
Locations is less than that  stated in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as
applicable), then  the Title Defect Value shall be the absolute value of the
number determined  by  the following formula:

 

 

Title  Defect  Value = A x (1-[B/C])

 

 

A = Allocated  Value for the affected Asset

 

 

B = Correct  Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset

 

 

C = Net  Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit
D-1_ or  _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable).

 

 

(iii) If  the  Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon the  affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest
for which there  is  not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest)
for which the economic  detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the
Title Defect Value shall  be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of the affected Asset,  the portion of the Asset affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of  the  Title Defect, the potential discounted
economic effect of the Title Defect  over  the life of the affected Asset,
and the Title Defect Values placed upon the  Title Defect by Buyer and
Seller;

 

 

(iv) If  a  Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely affect an
Asset throughout  the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall
be taken into account  in determining the Title Defect Value;

 

 

(v) The  Title  Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any  costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder;

 

 

(vi) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed  the Allocated Value of the Wells, PUD Locations,
PDNP, Probable and/or Possible  Locations, Undeveloped Acreage or other
Assets affected thereby;

 

 

(vii) If  the  Title Defect Value of an Asset is equal to the Allocated
Value of such Asset,  the affected Asset shall be excluded from the purchase
and sale contemplated  by  this Agreement, and the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted  accordingly;

 

 

(viii) Notwithstanding  the provisions of this _Section 4.04_ to the
contrary, the Title Defect  Value of any Title Defect comprising a required
consent not obtained (other  than  consents customarily obtained after
Closing) shall be determined subject to  any  accommodation implemented
pursuant to _Section 4.08_; and

 

 

(ix) Such  other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper 
evaluation.

 

 

(b) The  term  Title Defect shall not include:

 

 

(i) Defects  based solely on an assertion that Seller's files lack
information, provided that  any missing material information can be obtained
by the reasonable efforts  of  Buyer;

 

 

(ii) Defects  in the early chain of title consisting of the failure to recite
marital status  in a document or omissions of successors of heirship or
estate proceedings,  unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the
assertion that such failure  or  omission has resulted in a third party's
actual and superior claim of title to  the affected Asset;

 

 

(iii) Defects  arising out of lack of survey;

 

 

(iv) Defects  arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization
unless Buyer  provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that the action
was not authorized  and that such lack of authorization has resulted in a
third party's actual and  superior claim of title to the affected Asset;

 

 

(v) Defects  that are defensible by possession under applicable statutes of
limitations  for  adverse possession or for prescription; provided that the
mere passage of time  in and of itself shall not establish any presumption of
the applicability of  the  provisions of this Section 4.04(b)(v);

 

 

(vi) Defects  asserting a change in an applicable Working Interest or Net
Revenue Interest  based on a change in drilling and spacing units, tract
allocation or other  changes in pooling or unit participation occurring after
the date of this  Agreement; and

 

 

(vii) Title  requirements customarily considered as advisory or which can be
waived as a  matter of prudent business judgment.

(a) The  Purchase Price shall not be decreased at Closing as a result of any
Title Defect  noticed pursuant to _Section 4.04_ (i) which is not cured prior
to or at  Closing (unless the Parties acting reasonably and in good faith
agree in lieu  of  a cure of the Title Defect upon the amount of an
adjustment to the Purchase  Price with respect thereto prior to the Closing),
or (ii) with respect to which  the Parties have not yet agreed as to the
validity of the Title Defect, the  Title Defect Value, or the manner of cure,
if any, of such Title Defect. 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.05_ , if any
Title Defect is in  the nature of a consent to assignment that is not
obtained or other restriction  on assignment, the provisions of _Section
4.08_ shall apply.

 

 

(c) If  at the  expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, the Parties
have not agreed upon  the validity of any asserted Title Defect, the
appropriate cure of the same,  or  the Title Defect Value attributable
thereto, either Party shall have the right  to elect to have any such dispute
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant  to _Section 4.14_.

 

 

**Section  4.06** _Special  Warranty of Title_.

 

 

The  documents to be executed and delivered by Seller to Buyer, transferring
title  to  the Assets as required hereby, including the Assignment and Bill

instruments, documents and other matters  described or referred to in any
Exhibit or Schedule hereto, or other terms  in  such instruments that create
or reserve to Seller its interest in the Assets;  provided, that, such
matters do not operate to (i) reduce the Net Revenue  Interest of Seller in
any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible  Locations as
reflected in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as  applicable), or (ii)
increase the proportionate share of costs and expenses  of leasehold

(f) all  royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, carried
interests,  production payments, reversionary interests and other burdens on

reduce the Net  Revenue Interest of Seller in any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or
Probable and/or  Possible Locations and as reflected in _Exhibit D-1_ or
_Exhibit D-2_   (as applicable) or reduce the net acres of any Undeveloped
Acreage as described  in _Exhibit A_ , or (ii) increase the proportionate
share of costs and  expenses of leasehold operations attributable to or to be
borne by the Working  Interest of Seller with respect to any Well, PUD
Location, PDNP or Probable  and/or Possible Locations as reflected in

operate to (i) reduce the Net Revenue Interest of Seller in  any  Well, PUD
Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible Locations as reflected  in 
_Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable) or reduce the net  acres of
any Undeveloped Acreage as described in _Exhibit A_ or  (ii) increase the

attributable to or to be borne by the Working Interest of Seller  with 
respect to any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible
Locations  as  reflected in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as
applicable),  unless there is a proportionate increase in Seller's applicable

regulate  any  of the Wells or units included in the Assets and the
applicable laws, rules,  and  regulations of such Governmental Authorities;

 

 

(l) all  defects and irregularities affecting the Assets which individually
or in the  aggregate do not operate to (i) reduce the Net Revenue Interest of

as  reflected in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable) or reduce 
the net acres of any Undeveloped Acreage as described in Exhibit A,  (ii)
increase the proportionate share of costs and expenses of leasehold 
operations attributable to or to be borne by the Working Interests of Seller 
with respect to any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible

Interest, or (iii) otherwise result in a material and adverse  interference
with the operation, value or use of the Assets;

 

 

(m) conventional  rights of reassignment arising upon decision to surrender
or abandon an  interest; and

 

 

(n) all  deeds  of trust and other security interests burdening the Assets
granted by Seller  in  connection with its credit facilities under which BNP
Paribas serves as  administration agent (the " _BNPP Liens_ "), it being
understood that the  release of the BNPP Liens is a condition to the Closing
as provided in  _Section 9.04_.

 

 

**Section  4.07** _Preferential  Rights to Purchase_.

 

 



 

 

(a) After  consultation with Buyer, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts,
but without  any obligation to incur anything but nominal costs and expenses
in connection  therewith, to comply with all preferential right to purchase
provisions relative  to any Asset prior to the Closing, including those
rights of preferential  purchase identified on _Schedule 4.07_.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any of
such preferential  purchase rights are exercised or if the requisite period
has elapsed without  such rights having been exercised.

 

 

(c) If  a  third party who has been offered an interest in any Asset
pursuant to a  preferential right to purchase elects prior to the Closing to
purchase all  or  part of such Assets, and the closing of such transaction
does occur on or before  the Closing Date, then the interest or part thereof
so affected will be  eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the  Allocated Value of such Assets. If any such third party
has elected to purchase  all or a part of an interest in any Asset subject to
a preferential right to  purchase, but has failed to close the transaction by
the Closing Date, then  all  of the Assets will be conveyed to Buyer at
Closing, without adjustment to the  Purchase Price, and on the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, as an Assumed Obligation,  assume all duties, obligations and
liabilities, of any kind or nature, arising  from, out of, or in connection
with, any enforceable preferential right to  purchase that is outstanding,
and, if exercised, Buyer shall receive the payment  therefor and shall assign
the affected portion of the Assets to the holder  of  such exercised
preferential right to purchase. In addition, in the event an  interest is
offered by Seller pursuant to a preferential right to purchase  for  which
notice has been given but the time period for response by the holder  of 
such right extends beyond Closing, such interest shall be conveyed to Buyer 
at  the Closing, without reduction to the Purchase Price, and shall be
subject  to  such preferential right of purchase.

 

 

**Section  4.08** _Consents  to Assignment_.

 

 

If  any Asset is subject to a Title Defect as a result of a consent to
assignment  not having been obtained, including those consents to assignment
set forth  on  _Schedule 4.08_ , or, of the existence of other restrictions
on assignment  or conveyance, the following provisions shall apply:

 

 

(a) Buyer  and  Seller shall cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement proposed to  provide Buyer with the benefits of ownership of the
affected Asset without  breaching the consent requirement or restriction
comprising such Title  Defect;

 

 

(b) If  such  arrangement involves Seller retaining actual title with
beneficial title being  assigned to Buyer at the Closing, then:

 

 

(i) only  such  beneficial title shall be assigned to Buyer at the Closing,
without any  adjustment to the Purchase Price for such Title Defect; and

 

 

(ii) if  such  consent is obtained or such restriction eliminated following
the Closing, then  Seller shall have the right to execute and deliver to
Buyer an assignment of  Seller's retained title and any related obligations
consistent with the terms of  this Agreement.

 

 

**Section  4.09** _Remedies  for Title Benefits_.

 

 



 

 

(a) If  Buyer  discovers any Title Benefit affecting the Assets, it shall
promptly notify  Seller in writing thereof. Subject to _Section 4.15_ ,
Seller shall be  entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price with
respect to all  Title  Benefits in an amount (the " _Title Benefit Value_ ")
determined in  accordance with the formula provided for in this _Section 
4.09(a)_. The term " _Title_ _ ____Benefit_ " shall mean Seller's Net 
Revenue Interest in any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or Possible 
Locations that is greater than or in addition to the Net Revenue Interest
set  forth in _Exhibit D-1_ or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable), or  Seller's
Working Interest in any Well, PUD Location, PDNP or Probable and/or  Possible
Locations that is less than the Working Interest set forth in  _Exhibit D-1_
or _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable) (without a  proportionate decrease in the
Net Revenue Interest). The Title Benefit Value  shall be the absolute value
of the number determined by the following  formula:

 

 

Title  Benefit  Value = A x (B/C)

 

 

A = Allocated  Value for the affected Asset

 

 

B = Correct  Net Revenue Interest for the affected Asset

 

 

C = Net  Revenue Interest for the affected Asset as set forth on _Exhibit
D-1_ or  _Exhibit D-2_ (as applicable).

 

 

(b) If  the  Title Benefit represents a decrease in Working Interest for
which there is  not a  proportionate decrease in Net Revenue Interest, the
amount of the Title Benefit  Value shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the  affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected
by the Title Benefit, the  legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
discounted economic effect  of  the Title Benefit over the life of the
affected Asset, and the Title Benefit  Values placed upon the Title Benefit
by Buyer and Seller.

 

 

(c) If  the  Parties have not agreed on the amount of the Title Benefit
Value of a Title  Benefit by the expiration of thirty (30) days after
Closing, Seller or Buyer  shall have the right to elect to have such Title
Benefit Value determined by  an  Independent Expert pursuant to _Section
4.14_. If the Title Benefit Value  is not determined pursuant to this
Agreement by the Closing, the Purchase Price  paid at Closing shall be
increased, subject to _Section 4.15_, by the  Title Benefit Value determined
by Buyer, acting reasonably and in good faith,  and, subject to _Section
4.15_. Upon the final determination of Title  Benefit Value either by mutual
agreement of the Parties or by the Independent  Expert, (i) Seller shall
refund to Buyer the amount, if any, by which the  amount so paid by Buyer at
Closing exceeds such Title Benefit Value, or  (ii) Buyer shall pay to Seller
the amount, if any, by which such Title  Benefit Value exceeds the amount so
paid by Buyer at Closing.

 

 

**Section  4.10** _Environmental  Review_. Buyer  may  conduct an
environmental assessment of the Assets prior to the expiration of  the 
Examination Period, subject to the following:

 

 

(a) Buyer  shall have the right to conduct a Phase I (as that term is defined
by the  American Society for Testing and Materials) environmental review of
the Assets  prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (" _Buyer 's
Environmental  Review_") and Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of any
environmental  review Seller has in its possession subject to the same terms
of confidentiality  subsequently set forth herein;

 

 

(i) The  cost  and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review shall be borne
solely by  Buyer;

 

 

(ii) All  inspections must be coordinated through a designated representative
of Seller  who may accompany Buyer during the course of Buyer's inspection of
the  Assets;

 

 

(iii) All  environmental assessments shall be conducted by an independent
environmental  consultant engaged by Buyer at Buyer's expense;

 

 

(iv) Buyer  shall give Seller notice not more than seven (7) days and not
less than forty  eight (48) hours before any visits by Buyer and/or its
consultant to the Assets,  and Buyer shall seek and obtain Seller's prior
consent (which shall not be  unreasonably withheld) before either it or its
consultant enters the  Assets;

 

 

(v) Buyer  shall provide Seller a copy of the Phase I report affecting the
Assets promptly  after Buyer's receipt of the same;

 

 

(vi) Buyer  shall give Seller prompt written notice and obtain Seller's prior
written  consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) if Buyer desires to
conduct a Phase  II  (as that term is defined by the American Society for
Testing and Materials)  study based on the recommendations of Buyer's
independent environmental  consultant (acting reasonably) with respect to the
Assets. With  respect to any samples taken in connection with Buyer's
Environmental Review,  Buyer shall take split samples, providing one of each
such sample, properly  labeled and identified, to Seller;

 

 

(vii) Buyer  and/or its consultant shall perform all such work in a safe and
workmanlike  manner, shall not unreasonably interfere with Seller's
operations, and shall  comply with all Laws of applicable Governmental
Authorities;

 

 

(viii) Buyer  shall be solely responsible for obtaining any third party
consents that are  required in order to perform any work comprising Buyer's
Environmental Review,  and Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to
requesting each such third party  consent; and

 

 

(ix) Buyer  hereby agrees to release and defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and  Seller's Representatives from and against all Claims made by (or
attributable to  the acts or omissions of) Buyer or Buyer's Representatives
**(INCLUDING  THOSE RESULTING FROM THE SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE
(BUT NOT GROSS  NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF  SELLER OR ANY OF SELLER 'S  REPRESENTATIVES)** **** arising
out of or relating to  Buyer's Environmental Review. The release and
indemnity provisions of this  _Section 4.10_ shall survive termination or
Closing of this Agreement  notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided
for in this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) Unless  otherwise required by applicable Laws, Buyer shall treat any
matters revealed  by  Buyer's Environmental Review and any environmental
review provided by Seller to  Buyer, including any analyses, compilations,
studies, documents, reports or  data  prepared or generated from such review
(the " _Environmental Information_ "),  as confidential, and Buyer shall not
disclose any Environmental Information  to  any Governmental Authority or
other third party without the prior written  consent of Seller. Buyer may use
the Environmental Information only in  connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The  Environmental Information shall be
disclosed by Buyer to only those persons  who  need to know the
Environmental Information for purposes of evaluating the  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and who agree to be bound by the  terms of
this _Section 4.10_. If Buyer or any third party to whom  Buyer has provided
any Environmental Information is requested, compelled or  required to
disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide  Seller
with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to  allow
Seller to file for any protective order, or seek any other remedy, as  it 
deems appropriate under the circumstances. If this Agreement is terminated 
prior  to the Closing, upon Seller's request Buyer shall deliver the
Environmental  Information, and all copies thereof and works based thereon,
to Seller, which  Environmental Information shall become the sole property of
Seller. Upon request  Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental
Information to Seller without  charge. The terms and provisions of this
_Section 4.10(b)_ shall survive  any such termination of this Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the  contrary.

 

 

**Section  4.11** _Definitions  Used in Article 4 and in this Agreement_.

 

 



 

 

(a) _Environmental  Defects_. The term " _Environmental Defect_ " shall mean,
with respect to  any given Asset, a material violation of Environmental Laws
in effect as of  the  Effective Time in the jurisdiction in which such Asset
is located.

 

 

(b) _Governmental  Authority_. The term " _Governmental Authority_ " shall
mean the United  States and any state, county, city and political
subdivisions that exercises  jurisdiction, and any agency, department, board,
commission or other  instrumentality thereof.

 

 

(c) _Environmental  Laws_. The term " _Environmental Laws_ " shall mean all
Laws currently in  effect of any Governmental Authority pertaining to health
or the environment  as  may be interpreted by applicable final, non-
appealable court decisions or  administrative orders.

 

 

(d) _Environmental  Defect Value_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Environmental  Defect Value_ " shall mean, with respect to any Environmental
Defect, the  estimated costs and expenses to correct such Environmental
Defect in the most  cost effective manner reasonably available, consistent
with Environmental Laws,  taking into account that non-permanent remedies
(such as, by way of example  but  not by limitation or similarity,
mechanisms to contain or stabilize hazardous  materials, including monitoring
site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-based  corrective action,
institutional controls or other appropriate restrictions  on  the use of
property, caps, dikes, encapsulation, leachate collection systems,  etc.) may
be the most cost effective manner reasonably available.

 

 

**Section  4.12** _Notice  of Environmental Defects_.

 

 

Buyer  shall provide Seller notice of all Environmental Defects no later than
5:00  p.m.  CDT on September 7, 2007; provided, however, if during the
Examination Period,  Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect affecting the
Assets, Buyer shall  promptly notify Seller of such alleged Environmental
Defect. To be effective,  such notice must (a) be in writing, (b) be received
by Seller prior to the  expiration of the Examination Period, (c) describe
the Environmental Defect  in  sufficient, specific detail, including the
written conclusion of Buyer that  an  Environmental Defect exists, which
conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated  by the factual data gathered in
Buyer's Environmental Review, (d) identify the  specific Assets affected by
such Environmental Defect, (e) set forth the  procedures recommended to
correct the Environmental Defect, (f) set forth  Buyer's reasonable good
faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value,  including the basis for
such estimate, and (g) comply with the Environmental  Defect Value provisions
of _Section 4.15_. Any matters that may otherwise  constitute Environmental
Defects, but of which Seller has not been specifically  notified by Buyer in
accordance with the foregoing, together with any  environmental matter that
does not constitute an Environmental Defect, shall  be  deemed to have been
waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute an Assumed  Obligation. Upon
receipt of notices of Environmental Defects, the Parties shall  meet and
determine upon which of the Environmental Defects, Environmental Defect 
Values and methods of correction the Parties have reached agreement. Upon
the  receipt of such effective notice from Buyer, Seller shall have the
option,  but  not the obligation, to attempt to correct such Environmental
Defect during  a  period expiring ninety (90) days after Closing. If Seller
should not elect  to  correct an Environmental Defect, and no aspect of such
defect is in dispute,  the  Purchase Price shall be adjusted for such defect
by the amount of the  Environmental Defect Value.

 

 

**Section  4.13** _Remedies  for Environmental Defects_.

 

 



 

 

(a) The  Purchase Price shall not be decreased as a result of any
Environmental Defect  noticed pursuant to the provisions of _Section 4.12_
which is not corrected  prior to or at Closing (unless the Parties acting
reasonably and in good faith  agree in lieu of a correction of the
Environmental Defect upon the amount of  an  adjustment to the Purchase
Price on account thereof prior to the Closing) or  with respect to which the
Parties have not yet agreed as to the validity of  the  Environmental
Defect, the Environmental Defect Value, or the manner of  correction, if any,
of such Environmental Defect.

 

 

(b) If  by the  expiration of thirty (30) days after Closing, the Parties
have not agreed upon  the validity of any asserted Environmental Defect, the
appropriate correction  of  the same, or on the Environmental Defect Value
attributable thereto, either  Party shall have the right to elect to have any
such dispute determined by  an  Independent Expert pursuant to _Section
4.14_.

 

 

**Section  4.14** _Independent  Experts_.

 

 



 

 

(a) Any  disputes regarding Title Defects, Title Benefits, Environmental
Defects, Title  Defect Value, Title Benefit Value, Environmental Defect
Value, appropriate  cure  of any Title Defects or correction of any
Environmental Defects, and the  calculation of any Statement, or revisions
thereto, may, subject to the  provisions of _Sections 4.05_ , _4.13_ and
_4.15_ , be submitted by  a Party, with written notice to the other Party, to
an independent expert (the  " _Independent Expert_ "), who shall serve as the
sole and exclusive  arbitrator of any such dispute. The Independent Expert
shall be selected by  the  Parties (acting reasonably and in good faith)
within fifteen (15) days following  the effective date of said notice. The
Independent Expert shall be a person  who  is independent, impartial, and
knowledgeable in the subject matter and  substantive laws involved, or in the
case of a dispute concerning an alleged  Environmental Defect, Environmental
Defect Value or cure of the same, the  Independent Expert shall have
expertise in both the applicable Environmental  Laws and environmental
science relating to the oil and gas  industry.

 

 

(b) The  Parties shall determine, acting in good faith, the procedures to be
followed  to  facilitate the decision of the Independent Expert. Such
procedures shall include  the following scenario:

 

 

(i) If  the  dispute involves the method or adequacy of cure or correction
of a Title Defect  or Environmental Defect, the Independent Expert shall
provide in writing the  particulars necessary to cure or correct or to remedy
any deficient cure or  correction, and shall provide Seller sixty (60) days
(or such additional time  as  reasonable and necessary under the
circumstances, but not to exceed 90 days  unless specifically agreed to in
writing by Seller and Buyer) to effect such  cure or correction;

 

 

(ii) In  the  event of circumstances described in clause (i) above, Seller
at its option  may  at any time during the sixty (60) day cure period
pursuant to clause (i) (as  such period may be extended pursuant to such
clause) decline to cure or correct  the applicable defect and may instead
promptly reimburse Buyer the amount of  the  Title Defect Value or
Environmental Defect Value, as the case may be;  and

 

 

(iii) If  the  dispute involves the validity of a Title Defect Value or
Environmental Defect  Value with respect to defects which either the Parties
agree or the Independent  Expert determines cannot be cured or corrected or
which Seller elects not to  cure or correct, Seller shall reimburse to Buyer
the Title Defect Value or  the  Environmental Defect Value relating to such
defect, as applicable, promptly  after the Independent Expert's resolution of
the same.

 

 

(c) If  the Parties fail to select an Independent Expert within such 15-day
period,  within three (3) days thereafter, each of Buyer and Seller shall
choose an  Independent Expert meeting the qualifications set forth above, and
such experts  shall promptly choose a third Independent Expert (meeting the
qualifications  provided for herein) who alone shall resolve the disputes
between the Parties.  Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
incurred in connection with  any  such proceeding, and one-half (1/2) of the
costs and expenses of the Independent  Expert.

 

 

(d) Disputes  to be resolved by an Independent Expert shall be resolved in
accordance with  mutually agreed procedures and rules and failing such
agreement, in accordance  with the rules and procedures for non-administered
arbitration set forth in  the  commercial arbitration rules of the American
Arbitration  Association. The Independent Expert shall be instructed by the 
Parties to resolve such dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light 
of  the circumstances using the terms and provisions of this Agreement with
respect  to title and environmental matters. The decision and award of the
Independent  Expert shall be binding upon the Parties and final and
nonappealable to the  maximum extent permitted by Laws or Environmental Laws,
as applicable, and  judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent
jurisdiction and  enforced by any Party as a final judgment of such court.

 

 

(e) All  proceedings under this _Section 4.14_ shall be conducted in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma or such other mutually agreed location.

 

 

**Section  4.15** _Limitation  of Remedies Title Benefits, Title Defects and
Environmental  Defects_.

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,

 

 

(a) if  the  Title Defect Value for a given Title Defect, or the Title
Benefit Value of  a  given Title Benefit, in each case as determined
pursuant to this _Article  4_ does not exceed Twenty Thousand Dollars
($20,000), or if the Environmental  Defect Value for a given Environmental
Defect, as determined pursuant to this  _Article 4_ does not exceed Twenty
Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000), such  Title Defect, Title Benefit or
Environmental Defect shall not qualify for either  a Purchase Price
adjustment, cure or correction of such defect;

obligation on Seller's part to continue operating any  Assets after the
Closing, if Seller elects, at its sole option, to continue  to  operate any
Assets following the Closing at the request of Buyer, or by any  third party
working interest owner due to constraints of applicable joint  operating

disposal wells, wells that are  temporarily abandoned and wells that are
otherwise inactive, as reimbursement  for all general and administrative
overhead (" _Overhead Fee_ ") incurred by  Seller in connection with the
conduct of operations of the Assets. In the event  Seller transfers
operations to Buyer or its designee between the first and  last  day of a
calendar month, Seller shall be paid such amount of the Overhead Fee

provide for  herein:

through the  production month following the month in which Closing occurs

respect to Hydrocarbons  produced after the Post-Closing Production Month.

 

 

(b) Seller  will continue to pay or bill joint interest owners for expenses
through the  accounting month following the Post-Closing Production Month.

Assets not  operated by Seller for joint billings for the billing month after
the month  in  which Closing occurs. All subsequent bills will either be
returned to  the applicable operator for rebilling to Buyer or forwarded to
Buyer for  payment, or if already paid by Seller, will be charged against
Buyer in the  Final Settlement Statement. Seller will continue to prepare
all  regulatory and other monthly production reports through the Post-
Closing  Production Month. Copies of such reports attributable to the period
after the  Effective Time will be provided to Buyer, along with the final
ending inventory  balance.

 

 

(c) Seller  will continue to pay all shut-in royalties, minimum royalties,
delay rentals  and  other lease payment obligations through the Post-Closing
Production  Month.

 

 

(d) Seller  shall market and nominate all Hydrocarbons in the same manner as

**Section  7.05** _Limitations  on Liability of Operator_ _._

hereby agrees to release and defend,  indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
Seller's Representatives harmless from,  the incorrect payment of expenses,
taxes, billings, delay rentals, royalties,  minimum royalties, payments
required by any of the Leases, shut-in royalties  or  similar payments, or
for any failure to pay any such payments through mistake  or  oversight
**(INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE
(BUT NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), STRICT LIABILITY  OR 
OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF SELLER OR ANY OF SELLER 'S  REPRESENTATIVES)** **** from

respect to the same  remains pending on the Final Settlement Date shall be
made on a date mutually  agreed by the Parties, both acting reasonably.

the  indemnified Claims. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller's  aggregate liability hereunder shall not exceed, and shall be
limited to, ten  percent (10%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price; provided,
that, Claims relating  to Seller's failure to pay the Interim Operating
Expenses, and any other costs  and expenses to be paid by Seller hereunder
and reflected in an upward Purchase  Price Adjustment, shall not be subject
to the threshold or maximum liability  limit set forth above, nor shall such
amounts be included in the determination  of whether the Threshold or maximum
liability limit has been  reached.

 

 

**Section  12.11** _Survival_.

 

 

The  representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties set

transactions  contemplated hereby; provided, that the covenants, agreements
and indemnities  of  Seller shall survive only for a period of six (6)
months after the Closing  and  the representations and warranties of Seller
shall not survive the Closing.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be entitled to make,  and hereby waives the right to assert,
any Claim against Seller unless Buyer  seeks indemnification for such Claim
by a written notice received by Seller  on  or before the date that is six
(6) months after the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "). Anything in
this Agreement to the contrary  notwithstanding, after the Expiration Date,
all of the Retained Liabilities  and  all of Seller's other liabilities and
obligations with respect to the Assets  (and all Claims with respect thereto)
shall be deemed and constitute Assumed  Obligations hereunder (a) except to
the extent of any Claims of which Buyer  notifies Seller on or before the
Expiration Date in accordance with this  Agreement and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement and (b)  except to the extent such
liabilities and obligations are accepted and paid  by  any applicable
insurers as covered claims under valid and collectible insurance  policies
issued in favor of Seller.

 

 

**Section  12.12** _Exclusive  Remedy_.

 

 

The  terms and provisions of this _Article 12_ and those provided in
_Article  4_ , _Article 7, Article 8, and Article 9_ shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy of each of the Parties indemnified hereunder with respect 
to  the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties
set  forth in this Agreement and the other documents executed and delivered 
hereunder.

 

 

**Section  12.13** _Defenses  and Counterclaims_.

 

 

Each  Party that is required to assume any obligation or liability of the
other Party  pursuant to this Agreement or that is required to release and
defend, indemnify  or hold the other Party harmless hereunder shall,
notwithstanding any other  provision hereof to the contrary, be entitled to
the use and benefit of all  defenses (legal and equitable) and counterclaims
of such other Party in defense  of third party Claims arising out of any such
assumption or  indemnification.

 

 

**Section  12.14** _Anti-Indemnity  Statute_.

 

 

Buyer  and Seller agree that with respect to any statutory limitations now or
hereafter  in effect affecting the validity or enforceability of the
indemnities provided  for in this Agreement, including, the provisions of
Section 127 of the Texas  Civil Practice and Remedies Code, such indemnities
shall be deemed amended  in  order to comply with such limitations. This
provision concerning statutory  limitations shall not apply to indemnities
for all liabilities of the  indemnifying Party which are covered by such
Party's insurance.

**Section  14.12** _Severability_.

 

 

If  any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable  of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions  and  provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect  and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as  to  effect their original intent as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner  to  the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent  possible.

 

 

**Section  14.13** _Interpretation_.

 

 

This  Agreement shall be deemed and considered for all purposes to have been
jointly  prepared by the Parties, and shall not be construed against any one
Party (nor  shall any inference or presumption be made) on the basis of who
drafted this  Agreement or any particular provision hereof, who supplied the
form of  Agreement, or any other event of the negotiation, drafting or
execution of  this  Agreement. Each Party agrees that this Agreement has
been purposefully drawn  and  correctly reflects its understanding of the
transaction that it contemplates.  In  construing this Agreement, the
following principles will apply:

 

 

(a) A  defined  term has its defined meaning throughout this Agreement and
each Exhibit and  Schedule to this Agreement, regardless of whether it
appears before or after  the  place where it is defined.

 

 

(b) If  there  is any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of
the main body of  this  Agreement and the provisions of any Exhibit or
Schedule hereto, the provisions  of this Agreement shall take precedence. If
there is any conflict between the  provisions of any pro forma Assignment
**** or other  transaction documents attached to this Agreement as an Exhibit
and the  provisions of any Assignment and other transaction documents
actually executed  by the parties, the provisions of the executed Assignment
and other executed  transaction documents shall take precedence.

 

 

(c) Schedules  and Exhibits referred to herein are hereby incorporated and
made a part of  this  Agreement for all purposes by such reference.

 

 

(d) The  omission of certain provisions of this Agreement from the 
Assignment **** does not constitute a conflict or inconsistency  between this
Agreement and the Assignment, and will not effect a merger of  the  omitted
provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by Laws, all provisions  of 
this Agreement are hereby deemed incorporated into the Assignment by 
reference.

 

 

(e) The  word " _includes_ " and its derivatives means "includes, but not
limited to" and  corresponding derivative meanings.

 

 

(f) The  Article, Section, Exhibit and Schedules references in this Agreement
refer  to  the Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement.
The headings  and titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall
have no  significance in interpreting or otherwise affect the meaning of
this  Agreement.

 

 

(g) The  term " _knowledge_ ," whether or not capitalized, shall mean the
actual knowledge  of a Party's employees who, as of Closing are in a
supervisory capacity  responsible for the ownership and operation of the
Assets and any material  facts  relating thereto, without duty of inquiry
under the terms of this  Agreement.

 

 

(h) The  adjective, " _material_ ", whether or not capitalized, shall mean
a  situation, circumstance, consequence or concept whose relevance to the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a whole is of significance, 
and  would not be considered a small or insignificant deviation from the
terms of  this Agreement.

 

 

(i) The  term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any defect,
condition, change or  effect (other than with respect to which an adjustment
to the Purchase Price  has  been made) that when taken together with all
other such defects, conditions,  changes and effects significantly diminishes
the value, use, operations or  development of the Assets, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the  following shall not be considered in
determining whether a Material Adverse  Effect has occurred:

 

 

(i) Fluctuations  in commodity prices;

 

 

(ii) Changes  in Laws or Environmental Laws; or

 

 

(iii) Changes  in the oil and gas industry that do not have a
disproportionate impact on the  ownership and operation of the Assets.

 

 

(j) The  plural shall be deemed to include the singular, and vice versa.

 

 

**Section  14.14** _Time  of the Essence_.

 

 

Time  shall be of the essence with respect to all time periods and notice
periods  set  forth in this Agreement.

 

 

**Section  14.15** _Counterpart  Execution_.

 

 

This  Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each
counterpart  hereof shall be effective as to each Party that executes the
same whether or  not  all of such parties execute the same counterpart. If
counterparts of this  Agreement are executed, the signature pages from
various counterparts may be  combined into one composite instrument for all
purposes. All counterparts  together shall constitute only one Agreement, but
each counterpart shall be  considered an original.

 

 

**Section  14.16** _Insurance_.

 

 

Prior  to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(which in  any  event will not require the payment of additional
consideration by Seller) to  have Buyer named by a specific endorsement as an
additional insured under those  certain policies of insurance described in
Schedule 5.13 and the corresponding  policies issued to Seller that
immediately preceded these three specific  policies for the prior policy
year, in each case to the extent that Buyer would  not otherwise be an
insured party under the current terms of the applicable  policy.
