3 ARTICLE II __

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or the Parent
Parties or the holders of any securities of the Company or any other Person:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share, other than Excluded Shares,
Company Restricted Shares and Dissenting Shares, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive $13.65 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), whereupon all such Shares shall be automatically canceled
upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and the holders of such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Taxes), upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Treasury Shares; Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by (i) the Company (whether held
in treasury or otherwise) or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company or (ii) any of the Parent Parties, including the Rollover Shares
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist, and (x) except as provided by clause (y), no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and (y)
any Excluded Shares that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into and become such number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation as necessary (in the
aggregate with other such shares owned by such Subsidiary) to maintain such
Subsidiarys same relative ownership percentages in the Company as it had
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such Shares who
have ( _i_ ) not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and ( _ii_ ) properly

 



4  exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and
otherwise complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
only to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, unless and until any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares, including for
purposes of _Section 2.1(a)_, and shall be deemed to have been converted
into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided for in _Section 2.1(a)_. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent ( _x_ ) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such
demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and ( _y_ ) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle
any such demands.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as a
paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to the product
of ( _i_ ) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_ ( _ii_ ) the number of
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than the Excluded Shares, the Company Restricted Shares and the Dissenting
Shares) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "),
payable upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. In the
event any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in the Exchange Fund,
an amount equal to the product of ( _x_ ) the Merger Consideration _multiplied
by_ ( _y_ ) the number of such formerly Dissenting Shares. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 2.1_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an
amount sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by 

 



5  Parent; _provided_ that ( _A_ ) any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and ( _B_ ) no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to the former holders of Shares pursuant to this
_Article II_.

(b)  _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ ( _A_ ) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be
in such customary form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree prior to the Closing, and ( _B_ ) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive from
the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product
of ( _x_ ) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares multiplied by ( _y_ ) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment upon due
surrender of the Certificate therefor may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer and other
applicable Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance
with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Share.

 



6 (iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the
Parent Parties, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts ( _i_ ) shall be remitted by the applicable
entity to the appropriate Governmental Entity and ( _ii_ ) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for
transfer or any other reason, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to
in  _Section 2.2(b)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that
letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including all interest and the other proceeds of any investments thereof)
that remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation upon the Surviving Corporations demand, and any former holders
of Shares who have not surrendered their Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.2_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares, in each case subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. 

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, the Parent Parties, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by former holders of Shares as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



7 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent
and the Surviving Corporation and, if required by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Shares formerly represented
by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate _multiplied by_ the
Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes), without any
interest thereon.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Options, Company RSU Awards and Company
Restricted Shares_. In each case, subject to _Annex A_ hereto:

(a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company Options with respect to any of such
holders Company Options, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested and
whether with an exercise price per Share that is greater or less than, or
equal to, the Merger Consideration, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash from the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries equal to ( _A_ ) the product
of ( _i_ ) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Share of such Company Option multiplied by ( _ii_ ) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option, without interest, less ( _B_
) such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the payment
of the amount described in clause (A) (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a
holder of any Company Options with respect to any of such holders Company
Options, the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall pay to each holder of Company Options the Option Consideration, if any,
described in the immediately preceding sentence (through the Companys
payroll system or through the Companys equity award administrator) as soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time. Except as otherwise
agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of
any Company Options with respect to any of such holders Company Options, from
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no outstanding Company Options,
and the former holders thereof shall be entitled only to the payment of the
Option Consideration, if any.

(b) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company RSU Awards with respect to any of such
holders

 



8  Company RSU Awards, each Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested
(treating for this purpose any performance-based vesting condition to which
such Company RSU Award is subject as having been attained at "target" level),
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be canceled and converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries an amount in cash equal to
the RSU Award Consideration, plus any additional amounts related to dividend
equivalents credited with respect to such Company RSU Award prior to the
Effective Time, ( _i_ ) as soon as administratively practicable following the
Effective Time, in the case of a Company RSU Award that is vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or ( _ii_ ) as soon as
administratively practicable following such date(s) as such Company RSU Award
would have otherwise vested, if and only if such holder remains continuously
employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from the Effective
Time to such date(s), in the case of a Company RSU Award that is unvested as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and, for this purpose, each
Company RSU Award that was subject to performance-based vesting conditions
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to vest ratably on the
last day of each fiscal year of the Company during the portion of the
performance period applicable to such Company RSU Award which follows the
Effective Time)). By way of example of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence,
a Company RSU granted on March 8, 2011 subject to performance-based vesting
conditions for the Companys fiscal years ending in February 2012, 2013 and
2014, which has a target number of Shares of 100 and a vesting date of March
8, 2014, shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the RSU Award Consideration based on 100 Shares; if the
Effective Time occurs in 2013, then 100% of the RSU Award Consideration shall
be payable on the last day of the Companys fiscal year ending in February
2014, subject to the continuous employment requirement. If the same award had
been granted on March 8, 2012 subject to performance-based vesting conditions
for the Companys fiscal years ending in February 2013, 2014 and 2015, then
50% of the RSU Award Consideration shall be payable on the last day of the
Companys fiscal year ending in February 2014 and 50% payable on the last day
of the Companys fiscal year ending in February 2015, subject to the
continuous employment requirement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _RSU
Award Consideration_ " shall mean, with respect to a Company RSU Award, ( _A_
) the product of ( _x_ ) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
RSU Award multiplied by ( _y_ ) the Merger Consideration minus ( _B_ ) such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the payment to a
holder of such Company RSU Award of the amount described in clause (A).
Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent
and a holder of any Company RSU Award with respect to any of such holders
Company RSU Awards, from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
outstanding Company RSU Awards, and the former holders thereof shall be
entitled only to the payment of the RSU Award Consideration.

 



9 (c) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of any Company Restricted Shares with respect to any of
such holders Company Restricted Shares, each Company Restricted Share,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries an amount in cash equal to the Restricted Shares Consideration,
plus any additional amounts related to dividends payable on such Company
Restricted Shares prior to the Effective Time but which remain subject to the
vesting of the underlying Company Restricted Shares, on such date(s) as such
Company Restricted Share would have otherwise vested, subject to such
holder being continuously employed by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries from the Effective Time to such date(s) (for the avoidance of
doubt, it being understood that the Restricted Share Consideration shall be
payable only if such continuous employment requirement is satisfied on the
applicable vesting date(s)). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Restricted
Shares Consideration_ " shall mean, with respect to a Company Restricted
Share, ( _A_ ) the Merger Consideration minus ( _B_ ) such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the payment to a holder of such
Company Restricted Share of the amount described in clause (A). Except as
otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a
holder of any Company Restricted Shares with respect to any of such holders
Company Restricted Shares, from and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no outstanding Company Restricted Shares, and the former holders thereof shall
be entitled only to the payment of the Restricted Shares Consideration.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide optionees with
notice of their opportunity to exercise their Company Options if such notice
is required by the applicable plan or award agreement, adopt such resolutions
and take all other such actions as may reasonably be necessary in its
discretion to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options, the Company RSU
Awards and the Company Restricted Shares contemplated by this  _Section
2.3_.

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it

by others in the Company or its Subsidiaries to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Except as would not

Effect, the Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board, ( _i_ ) any material weaknesses in its internal controls over
financial reporting and ( _ii_ ) any allegation of fraud that involves

Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls
over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Since January
28, 2011, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company or its
Subsidiaries has received any written complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,

liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
November 2, 2012 and ( _e_ ) for liabilities or obligations that have been
discharged or paid in full, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to
be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than as does not constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



17 Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) The Parent Parties have received and accepted an executed commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof (including the exhibits, annexes and
schedules thereto, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party
thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend amounts set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "). The Debt Financing
Commitments pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter are collectively referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_." Parent has entered into a
Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof (including the
exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto, the " _Securities Purchase Agreement_
") with the purchaser party thereto (the " _Subordinated Securities Purchaser_
") pursuant to which the Subordinated Securities Purchaser has agreed,

Commitment_ "). The Subordinated Securities Financing Commitment pursuant to
the Securities Purchase Agreement is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Subordinated Securities Financing_."

(b) Parent has received and accepted ( _i_ ) the Equity Investors Commitment
Letter from the Equity Investors pursuant to which the Equity Investors have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the
amounts set forth

 



31  therein (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ "), ( _ii_ ) the MD Investors
Commitment Letter from certain of the MD Investors pursuant to which, subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, ( _x_ ) certain of the MD Investors have
committed to transfer, contribute and deliver the Rollover Shares to Parent in
exchange for equity interests and Parent and ( _y_ ) one of the MD Investors
has committed to invest in Parent the amount set forth therein (collectively,
the " _Rollover Investment_ ") and ( _iii_ ) the MSDC Investor Commitment
Letter (together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Equity Investors Commitment Letter and the MD Investors
Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from the MSDC Investor
pursuant to which the MSDC Investor has agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amount set forth therein (the "
_MSDC Financing Commitment_ " and, together with the Debt Financing
Commitments, the Subordinated Securities Financing Commitment, the Equity
Financing Commitment and the Rollover Investment, the " _Financing
Commitments_ "). The equity committed pursuant to the Equity Investors
Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Equity Financing_." The equity committed pursuant to the MSDC Investor
Commitment Letter is referred to in this Agreement as the " _MSDC Financing_."
The Equity Financing, the Subordinated Securities Financing, the Debt
Financing, the Rollover Investment and the MSDC Financing are collectively
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Financing_." Parent has delivered to
the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment
Letters and the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "
_Fee Letter_ ") (except that the fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic
terms (none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability of the
Debt Financing) set forth therein have been redacted). As of the date
hereof, there are no agreements, side letters or arrangements, other than the
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter, to which any of the Parent Parties or
their Affiliates is a party relating to any of the Financing Commitments that
could adversely affect the availability of the Financing.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Fee
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders,
the Subordinated Securities Purchaser, the Equity Investors, the MD Investors
that are party to the MD Investors Commitment Letter and the MSDC Investor to
provide the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders, the
Subordinated Securities Purchaser, the Equity Investors, the MD Investors that
are party to the MD Investors Commitment Letter or the MSDC Investor to reduce
the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ and the completion of the
Marketing Period, as of the date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing Commitments will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to the Parent Parties on
the Closing Date.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_, the Financing, when funded in accordance with
the Commitment Letters,

 



32  together with the cash of the Company after and assuming completion of the
Cash Transfers and the other transactions contemplated by _Section 5.17_,
will provide Parent with cash proceeds (after netting out original issue
discount and similar premiums and charges after giving effect to the maximum
amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter) on the Closing Date sufficient for
the satisfaction of the Parent Parties obligations to ( _i_ ) pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, ( _ii_ ) satisfy and retire the Repayment Debt
(or deposit with any trustee therefor on the Closing Date sufficient funds to
redeem such Repayment Debt 30 days after the Closing Date) and repay the
Revolving Credit Facility Debt and terminate the Revolving Credit Facilities
and ( _iii_ ) pay any fees and expenses of or payable by the Parent Parties
or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Financing.

(e) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are ( _i_ ) valid and
binding obligations of the relevant Parent Parties and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, of each of the other parties thereto (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and ( _ii_ ) in
full force and effect. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the relevant Parent Parties
under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters. The Parent Parties
have paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of
this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the
Closing Date. None of the Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or
altered as of the date hereof, and, as of the date hereof, none of the
respective commitments under any of the Commitment Letters have been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

(f) Without limiting _Section 8.5(b)_, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any Parent Partys obligations hereunder.

Section 4.7 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, 10 shares of which are validly issued and

and at the Effective Time will be, directly or indirectly owned by Parent.
Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement
pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may directly or indirectly
acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been formed solely
for the purpose of the Merger Agreement and has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have,
no

obligations, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, between
the Parent Parties, the Equity Investors, the MD Investors, the MSDC Investor

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to the ownership or
operations of the Company after the Effective Time, or ( _ii_ ) prohibiting
the parties to the Voting Agreement from taking the actions described

the Company and none of Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has any rights
to acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock except
pursuant to this Agreement, the MD Investors Commitment Letter, agreements to
which the Company is a party and as set forth in _Section 4.9_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger and the Financing) and assuming ( _i_ ) the accuracy in
all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in _Article III_ and ( _ii_ ) the performance in all material

meanings:

(i) " _Fair Value_ " means the amount at which the assets (both tangible and
intangible), in their entirety, of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole would change hands between a willing buyer and a
willing seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each having
reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any
compulsion to act.

(ii) " _Present Fair Salable Value_ " means the amount that could be obtained
by an independent willing seller from an independent willing buyer if the
assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are
sold with reasonable promptness in an arms-length transaction under present
conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such
conditions can be reasonably evaluated.

 

(iii) " _Liabilities_ " means the recorded liabilities (including contingent
liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of the Surviving

period from the Closing Date to the date that is six and one half years after
the Closing Date the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis taken as a whole will have sufficient assets and cash flow
to pay their Liabilities as those liabilities mature or (in the case of
contingent Liabilities) otherwise become payable, in light of business
conducted or anticipated to be conducted by the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as reflected in any projected financial statements delivered to
the Lenders and in light of the anticipated credit capacity.

(v) " _Do not have Unreasonably Small Capital_ " means the Surviving

the period from 

 



35  the Closing Date to the date that is six and one half years after the
Closing Date (it being understood that "unreasonably small capital" depends
upon the nature of the particular business or businesses conducted or to be
conducted, and is based on the needs and anticipated needs for capital of the

and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as reflected in any projected
financial statements delivered to the Lenders and in light of the anticipated
credit capacity).

 

Section 4.11 _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Parent Parties have delivered to the Company true and correct

with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors
rights generally and general principles of equity, and have not been
amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on
the part of either of the Guarantors under their respective Limited
Guarantees.

provided access for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of
the Parent Parties has relied solely upon its independent investigation and

upon any representations, warranties or statements, whether express or
implied, made by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives,

representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally. Each
of the Parent Parties acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives,
shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever to the Parent Parties or
their respective Affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or

warranty except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) no
Person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or

Section 5.2 _Access; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to
the Parent Parties and the Lenders and to their respective directors,

employees, properties, Contracts, commitments, books and records, other than,
subject to the requirements of  _Section 5.3_, any such matters that relate
to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or to transactions
potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or proposals from other parties relating to any competing or
alternative transactions. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not
be required to afford such access if and to the extent it would ( _w_ )
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its

obligations with respect to confidentiality, so long as the Company shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such

and Silver Lake Partners III, L.P. (as amended, the " _SLP Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and the confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 31, 2012,
between the Company and Michael S. Dell (the " _MSD Confidentiality Agreement_
").

 

Section 5.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the 46th calendar day after the date of this
Agreement (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall have the right to ( _i_ )
initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, including by providing
information (including non-public information and data) regarding, and
affording access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and
personnel of, the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to ( _x_
) a confidentiality agreement entered into by such Person containing
confidentiality terms that are no more favorable in the aggregate to such
Person than those contained in the SLP Confidentiality Agreement (unless the
Company offers to amend the SLP Confidentiality Agreement to reflect such
more favorable terms), or ( _y_ ) to the extent applicable, the
confidentiality agreement entered into with such Person prior to the date of
this Agreement (any such confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable_

 



42   __ _Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) make available to the Parent
Parties any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
that is provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made
available to the Parent Parties, and ( _ii_ ) engage in, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons
or group of Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposals and cooperate
with or assist or participate in or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition
Proposals. No later than two (2) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each
Person or group of Persons from whom the Company received a written
Acquisition Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date and provide to Parent ( _x_ ) a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal made in writing and any other written terms or proposals
provided (including financing commitments) to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and ( _y_ ) a written summary of the material terms of any
Acquisition Proposal not made in writing (including any terms proposed orally
or supplementally). 

(b) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for as long as such
Person or group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this
_Section 5.3_, after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, immediately cease any activities permitted by _Section
5.3(a)_ and any discussions or negotiations with any Person or group that may
be ongoing with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. With respect to any
Person or group with whom such discussions or negotiations have been
terminated, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
require such Person or group to promptly return or destroy in accordance with
the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company.

(c) Except as may relate to any Excluded Party (for so long as such Person or
group is an Excluded Party) or as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_,
from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall instruct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, ( _i_ ) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any
inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) engage
in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to, or provide any non-public
information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person
relating to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, or ( _iii_ ) enter into
any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement,
or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in
principle, or any other agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 



43 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(b)_
or  _5.3(c)_ at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
the time the Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal from any Person, the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and ( _i_ ) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information (including non-public information and data) regarding, and afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of,
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company receives from
such Person (or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours) make available to the Parent Parties any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access that was not previously made available to the Parent
Parties, and ( _ii_ ) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with such Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Company Board, upon recommendation from the Special Committee,
determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the commencement of the
No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue to engage in the
activities described in  _Section 5.3(a)_ (subject to the limitations and
obligations set forth therein) with respect to, and the restrictions in
_Section 5.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(c)_ shall not apply to, any Excluded Party
(but only for so long as such Person or group is an Excluded Party),
including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition Proposal
submitted by any Excluded Party following the No-Shop Period Start Date.

 

(e) Except as may relate to an Excluded Party, following the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours
after receipt), notify Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiries that would reasonably be expected to
result in an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information from, or
any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed with, either the Company
or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
include ( _i_ ) a copy of any Acquisition Proposal (including any financing
commitments) made in writing and other written terms or proposals provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and ( _ii_ ) a written summary of the
material terms of any Acquisition Proposal not made in writing or any such
inquiry or request. Except as may relate to an Excluded Party, following the
No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of any material
developments, material discussions or material negotiations

 



44  regarding any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, or request for non-public
information and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, shall apprise Parent
of the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect to any of the
foregoing. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the
date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit them
from providing such information or the information contemplated by the last
sentence of _Section 5.3(a)_ to Parent.

(f) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(f)_, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall ( _i_ ) (
_A_ ) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent (or publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify
or modify), the Recommendation with respect to the Merger, ( _B_ ) fail to
include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, ( _C_ ) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of
the Company, an Acquisition Proposal or ( _D_ ) if a tender offer or exchange
offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company shareholders (including,
for these purposes, by disclosing that it is taking no position with respect
to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders,
which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such
tender offer or exchange offer, _provided_ that a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
of the Exchange Act shall not be prohibited), within ten (10) Business Days
after commencement (any of the foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_
") or ( _ii_ ) authorize, adopt or approve or propose to authorize, adopt or
approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time the Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained (but not after),
the Company Board may ( _I_ ) effect a Change of Recommendation if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and upon recommendation thereof by the Special Committee) that, as a
result of a development or change in circumstances that occurs or arises after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than a Superior Proposal)
that was not known to the Special Committee prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (an " _Intervening Event_ "), failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and ( _II_ ) if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that the Special Committee determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisors) constitutes a Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt, or approve such
Superior Proposal and cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board may only take the actions described in (
_1_ ) clause (II) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ concurrently with entering into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and pays the applicable Company Termination Fee in
compliance with _Section 7.3_ and ( _2_ ) clauses (I) or (II) if:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent
Parties, of its or the Company Boards intention to take such actions at least
four (4) Business Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall
specify, as applicable, the details of such Intervening Event or the material
terms of the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with, and the identity of, the party making the Acquisition
Proposal and other material documents (including any financing commitments
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and any arrangements with the MD
Investors or any of their Affiliates);

 



45 (ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions,
the Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to,
negotiate with the Parent Parties in good faith (to the extent the Parent
Parties desire to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Financing as would permit the Company, the Special Committee or the Company
Board not to take such actions; and

(iii) the Special Committee and the Company Board shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement and the Financing or other
arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM Central Time
on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and
shall have determined in good faith ( _A_ ) with respect to the actions
described in clause (II), after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and ( _B_ ) with respect to
the actions described in clauses (I), after consultation with
outside counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of
Recommendation, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were given effect.

 

After compliance with the foregoing clause (2) with respect to any Superior
Proposal, the Company shall have no further obligations under the foregoing
clause (2), and the Company Board shall not be required to comply with such
obligations with respect to any other Superior Proposal. After compliance with
the foregoing clause (2) with respect to an Intervening Event that is not an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall have no further obligations under the
foregoing clause (2), and the Company Board shall not be required to comply
with such obligations with respect to any other Intervening Event that is not
an Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to an
Intervening Event that is an Acquisition Proposal (and is not a Superior
Proposal), the Companys obligation to comply with the foregoing clause (2)
will not be limited. 

 



46 (g) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 5.3(g)_, nothing contained in
this  _Section 5.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company
Board, the Special Committee or any other committee of the Company Board from
( _i_ ) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state
Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer),
or ( _ii_ ) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communications to the stockholders of the Company);
_provided_ , that neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
effect a Change of Recommendation unless the applicable requirements of
_Section 5.3(f)_ shall have been satisfied.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer made by any Person for, in a single
transaction or a series of transactions, ( _i_ ) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, extra-
ordinary dividend or share repurchase, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company, ( _ii_ ) the direct or indirect acquisition
by any Person or group of twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries representing twenty percent (20%) or more of
the consolidated revenues or net income (including, in each case, securities
of the Companys Subsidiaries) or ( _iii_ ) the direct or indirect
acquisition by any Person or group of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning Shares with twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting
power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Excluded Party_ " means ( _i_ ) any Person,
group of Persons or group of Persons that includes any Person or group of
Persons, from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has received
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date a written Acquisition Proposal that
the Special Committee determines in good faith (such determination to be made
no later than five (5) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start Date),
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, is or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that
some or all of such Persons and the other members of such group (other than
any of the MD Investors or any of their respective Affiliates (the " _MD
Investor Group_ ")) who were members of such group immediately prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least 50% of the equity financing of
such group (ignoring any equity financing to be provided by members of the MD
Investor Group who are members of such group) at any

 



47  time thereafter when a determination as to whether such Person is an
Excluded Party is required hereunder and ( _ii_ ) any group of Persons that
includes any MD Investor if, at the time of determination, such group of
Persons has made an Acquisition Proposal that is intended to compete with an
Acquisition Proposal made by another Excluded Party or any of their Affiliates
that does not include an MD Investor or any of their Affiliates.

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in clauses (ii)
and (iii) of the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50% and it being
understood that any transaction that would constitute an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof cannot constitute
a Superior Proposal under clause (i) under the definition thereof unless it
also constitutes a Superior Proposal pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii), as
applicable, after giving effect to this parenthetical) that the Company Board
has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor) is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal (including the financing, likelihood and timing of
consummation thereof) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing in response
to such Acquisition Proposal under the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ or
otherwise), _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, an extra-ordinary
dividend or share repurchase (or any merger or consolidation that is the
economic equivalent of an extra-ordinary dividend or share repurchase) shall
not constitute a Superior Proposal unless it constitutes a Superior Proposal
by virtue of clause (iii) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal and the
first parenthetical above, and the Person acquiring such shares is not the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.4 _Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, ( _i_ )
the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to
_Section 5.3_, include the Recommendation, and the Company and Parent shall
jointly prepare a Rule 13E-3 transaction statement on Schedule 13E-3 (the "
_Schedule 13E-3_ ") and ( _ii_ ) the Parent Parties shall furnish all
information concerning themselves and their Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide such other
assistance in the preparation of the Proxy Statement as may be reasonably
requested by the Company from time to time. As promptly as practicable (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the No Shop Period Start

shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, and the Company and the Parent
Parties shall jointly file the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC.

 



48 (b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and each of the Company, on
the one hand, and the Parent Parties, on the other hand, shall provide the
other(s) with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond (with the assistance of, and after consultation with, the Parent
Parties as provided by this _Section 5.4(b)_) as promptly as practicable to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and each of
the Company and the Parent Parties shall thereafter use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of, and after
consultation with, each other as provided by this _Section 5.4(b)_) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 13E-3. If, at any time prior to the Company Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, the Parent Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or the Parent
Parties which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, so that the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3
or the other filings shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties thereof, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
stated above, (i) prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents or responses
and shall ( _x_ ) with respect to those Parent-Related Sections of the Proxy
Statement, include, and ( _y_ ) with respect to all other portions of the
Proxy Statement, consider in good faith including, comments reasonably
proposed by the Parent in such documents or responses, and ( _ii_ ) prior to
filing or mailing the Schedule 13E-3 (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each

shall provide other(s) with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such documents or responses and shall include in such documents or responses
comments reasonably proposed by such other party. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders of Common Stock as of the record date
established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date
on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement.

Section 5.5 _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to _Section 5.4_, the Company
shall take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its
certificate 

 



49  of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys shareholders,
subject to compliance with the DGCL and the Exchange Act, for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals (the " _Company Meeting_ ");
_provided_ that the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting ( _i_
) with the consent of the Parent Parties, ( _ii_ ) for the absence of a
quorum, ( _iii_ ) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Meeting or ( _iv_ ) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approvals. The Company shall, through the Company Board and the Special
Committee, but subject to the right of the Company Board or the
Special Committee to make a Change of Recommendation pursuant to _Section
5.3_, provide the Recommendation and shall include the Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, and, unless there has been a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to  _Section 5.3_, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder Approvals. The
Parent Parties and their Representatives shall have the right to solicit
proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder Approvals.

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Company Benefit Plans and
Company Foreign Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing herein shall be construed
as prohibiting the amendment or termination of any of the foregoing
in accordance with its terms. For a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries for so long as such person is an
employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ ") ( _i_
) at least the same level of base salary or wages (as applicable) and target
cash incentive bonus and commission opportunities and ( _ii_ ) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company
Employee pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans and the Company Foreign Plans,
as applicable (excluding, for purposes of currently provided benefits, any
equity or equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits, retiree
medical benefits or transaction or retention bonuses). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Company Employee whose
employment terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time
severance benefits at least equal to the severance benefits provided for under
the Companys severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



50 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan
in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (
_i_ ) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and ( _ii_ )
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or equivalent
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans or the Company
Foreign Plans, as applicable, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable.

(d) This  _Section 5.6_ is included for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective transferees and permitted assigns and does not and
shall not create any right in any Person, including any Company Employee, or
any other participant in any Company Benefit Plan, Company Foreign Plan or
other employee benefit plan or arrangement that may be established or
maintained by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates following the Effective Time, or any beneficiary or
trustee thereof. Furthermore, nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, any right to employment or
continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a particular
term or condition of employment, or shall be construed as an amendment to any
Company Benefit Plan, Company Foreign Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement.

 



51 Section 5.7 _Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts
with respect to ( _i_ ) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of
waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the Parent Approvals,
from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, including ( _x_ ) in connection with any Regulatory
Law and ( _y_ ) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5.7(f)_,
the Irish Bank Approval (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "
_Governmental Consents_ "), ( _ii_ ) the obtaining of all other necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, ( _iii_ ) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and ( _iv_ ) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that no party shall be
required to pay (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not pay or agree
to pay without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Contract.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in ( _x_
) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
Governmental Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental
Entities (including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries are operating any business) and ( _y_ ) to the extent not made
prior to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all
applications and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company,
as promptly as practicable or as required by the Law of the jurisdiction of
the Governmental Entity. Each party shall supply as promptly as practicable
such information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be
requested by any Governmental Entity, including by complying at the earliest
reasonably practicable date with any request under or with respect to ( _i_ )
the HSR Act, ( _ii_ ) the EUMR, if required or, if not required under or with
respect to the EUMR, the Regulatory Laws of any EU or EEA Member State, if
required, ( _iii_ ) any other Governmental Consent and ( _iv_ ) any such
other applicable Laws for additional information, documents or other materials
received by Parent or the Company

 



52  or any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or
the Department of Justice, the European Commission or any other Governmental
Entity in connection with such applications or filings or the transactions
contemplated herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parent Parties shall
cause each of the Equity Investors, the MD Investors, the MSDC Investor and
the Subordinated Securities Purchaser to supply, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, such reasonable information, documentation, other material or
testimony that may be requested by any such Governmental Entity with respect
to the Equity Investors, MD Investors, MSDC Investor or
Subordinated Securities Purchaser, as the case may be, in connection with
such Governmental Consents.

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, the Company and
the Parent Parties shall take all such further action as may be necessary to
resolve such objections, if any, as the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement
authorities, the European Commission or other competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational),
or any other Person, may assert under any Regulatory Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger, in each case so as to enable the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur as promptly as
reasonably practicable (taking into account the other conditions to Closing
set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _6.3_ and the Marketing Period, and in any
event no later than the Outside Date), by proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by agreement, consent decree, hold separate order, trust or
otherwise, ( _x_ ) the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets,
businesses, services, products or product lines of the Parent Parties or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or behavioral limitations, conduct
restrictions or commitments with respect to any such assets, businesses,
services, products or product lines of the Parent Parties or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, ( _y_ ) the creation or termination of relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Parent Parties or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and ( _z_ ) any other actions that would
limit the freedom of action of the Parent Parties or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or
the Companys or the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries assets,
businesses, services, products or product lines, in each case as may be
required in order to obtain all required Governmental Consents as promptly as
practicable (including expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether
imposed by Law or agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delaying any of the foregoing beyond the Outside Date (each of
(x), (y) and (z), a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the Companys prior

 



53  written consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any waiting period
under any Regulatory Law or any agreement not to consummate the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall
not be required to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ unless it
is expressly conditioned on the effectiveness of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Parent Parties shall
not be obligated to agree to take any action, or accept any conditions,
restrictions, obligations or requirements, including any Divestiture Action,
with respect to the Parent Parties (as constituted and without giving effect
to the Merger), pursuant to this _Section 5.7_, and ( _ii_ ) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall agree without Parents prior written
consent, to take any action, or accept any conditions, restrictions,
obligations or requirements, including any Divestiture Action, with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ if such
actions, conditions, restrictions, obligations or requirements (including any
Divestiture Action) would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity and _Section 5.7(f)_, each of
the Company and Parent agrees ( _i_ ) to cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions and any other material actions
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_, ( _ii_ ) to furnish to the other such
necessary information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any notifications or filings, ( _iii_ ) to
keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion
of the transactions contemplated therein, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such transactions (including the Irish Bank Approval),
except any confidential information or business secrets, which information
shall be provided to counsel on a counsel-to-counsel basis only, ( _iv_ ) to
permit the other party to review and to incorporate the other partys
reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any third party
or any Governmental Entity with respect to obtaining the necessary
approvals for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Irish Bank Approval), and ( _v_ ) before
participating in any meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected
to address matters related to the transactions contemplated herein with any
Governmental Entity in connection with any of such transactions (except with
respect to the Irish Bank Approval) unless, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, giving the other party reasonable notice thereof
and the opportunity to attend and observe and participate. The parties shall
take reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege
or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.7(d)_ in a manner so as to
preserve any applicable privilege. Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section 5.7(d)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information

 



54  contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.7_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or any other
Person is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory
Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limiting the foregoing,
taking the actions set forth in _Section 5.7(c)_ (subject to the limitations
set forth therein).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.7_, ( _i_ ) the
Company shall notify the CBI of the Merger or cause DFS Limited to do so, and
shall cause DFS Limited to amend its application for the Irish Bank Approval
such that the amended application contemplates and reflects the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly after the Merger
is announced; ( _ii_ ) subject to clause (v)(B) below, the Parent Parties
shall furnish, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
the Equity Investors, the MD Investors and the MSDC Investor and furnish, to
the Company all necessary information and assistance as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of such amendment and
all information, documentation or other material that may be requested by the
CBI in connection therewith; ( _iii_ ) without the prior written consent of
the Parent Parties, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries (including DFS Limited) to not, accept, obtain or receive the
Irish Bank Approval from the CBI or take any further action in connection
with doing so except to the extent that the resulting Irish Bank Approval (
_x_ ) contemplates and approves the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and ( _y_ ) results in no Irish Change of
Control Approval being required to be obtained as a result of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; ( _iv_ ) where any
Irish Bank Approval is obtained or received by DFS Limited on a basis that
would result in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement giving rise to a requirement for an Irish Change of Control Approval
the Company shall, or cause DFS Limited to, promptly request the CBI to
revoke such Irish Bank Approval; and ( _v_ ) none of the MD Investors, the
MSDC Investor, the Equity Investors or any of their Respective Affiliates
shall be required, in connection with the Companys efforts to seek the
Irish Bank Approval or the Irish Change of Control Approval, ( _A_ ) to take
any actions, be subject to any conditions or enter into any agreements or
commitments of any kind or ( _B_ ) to disclose or provide access to any of
the information identified in _Section 5.7_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the

other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or other the

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and the Parent Parties agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be,
of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or
in any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, subject
to compliance with applicable Law, shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and, subject to compliance with applicable Law, shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at
the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification and
advancement in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim.

 



57 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the Indemnified Parties) each current and former
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person
who served, at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as a
director, officer, member trustee, or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time in connection with
such Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Partys service as officer, director, member, trustee or other
fiduciary in any other entity if such services were at the request or for the
benefit of the Company);  _provided_ that any Person to whom any funds are
advanced pursuant to the foregoing must, if required by Law, provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such Action,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with each other in the defense of any such Action.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that, if the
aggregate annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current
annual premium for such insurance (which is identified on _Section 5.10(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter), then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided, a policy for the applicable individuals with as much coverage
as can reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost up to but
not exceeding 300% of such current annual premium. At the Companys option,
the Company may (or, if requested by Parent, the Company shall) purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising

 



58  on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ that the aggregate premium for
such insurance policy shall not exceed 600% of the current annual premium for
such insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause to be paid all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this _Section 5.10_ if and to the extent that such Indemnified Party is
determined to be entitled to receive such indemnification. 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.
The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors or officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their officers or directors, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 5.10_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
such policies.

(g) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with and subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its operations. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.11_ shall
not apply to limit Michael S. Dell in his capacity as a director of the
Company, Chairman of the Company Board or Chief Executive Officer of the
Company.

 



59 Section 5.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each Parent Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or
cause to be obtained, the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, the
"flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), including using its reasonable
best efforts with respect to ( _i_ ) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letters, ( _ii_ ) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) or, if available, on other terms that are
acceptable to Parent and would not adversely affect (including with respect to
timing, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the
ability of the Parent Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein, and ( _iii_ ) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent
and its Subsidiaries to obtaining the Financing that are within the Parent
Parties control. In the event that all conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Securities Purchase Agreement (other than, with
respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing, the
Subordinated Securities Financing, the MSDC Financing or the Rollover
Investment and, with respect to the Subordinated Securities Financing, the
Debt Financing, the Equity Financing, the MSDC Financing or the Rollover
Investment) have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), each
Parent Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to timely cause the Lenders
and the Subordinated Securities Purchaser to fund the Debt Financing and the
Subordinated Securities Financing, as applicable (including by seeking through
litigation to enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter
and Definitive Agreements and the Securities Purchase Agreement, as
applicable). 

(b) The Parent Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, ( _i_ ) terminate any Commitment Letter, unless such Commitment
Letter is replaced in a manner consistent with the following clause (ii), or (
_ii_ ) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement ( _w_ ) would ( _1_ ) add any
new condition to the Financing Commitments (or modify any existing condition
in a manner adverse to Parent) or otherwise that would be reasonably expected
to adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of the Parent Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the likelihood
of the Parent Parties doing so, or ( _2_ ) taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period, would be reasonably expected to make the
timely funding of any of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining any of the Financing less likely to occur,

 



60  ( _x_ ) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing
the amount of fees to be paid in respect of the Debt Financing or original
issue discount in respect of the Debt Financing), ( _y_ ) adversely affects
the ability of any Parent Party to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, or ( _z_ ) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , that the
Parent Parties may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and who are either
( _1_ ) set forth on _Section 5.12(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (
_2_ ) approved by the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of the Debt
Financing Commitments, the Subordinated Securities Financing Commitment, the
Equity Financing Commitment, the MSDC Financing Commitment or the Rollover
Investment in accordance with this _Section 5.12(b)_, the term "Debt
Financing Commitments", "Subordinated Securities Financing Commitment",
"Equity Financing Commitment", "MSDC Financing Commitment" or "Rollover
Investment" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitments, Subordinated
Securities Financing Commitment, Equity Financing Commitment, MSDC Financing
Commitment or Rollover Investment, as the case may be, as so amended,
supplemented, modified or replaced. To the extent written consent of
Parent is required for ( _x_ ) an assignment or delegation by any Equity
Investor pursuant to Section 3(a) of the Equity Commitment Letter, ( _y_ ) an
assignment or delegation by any MD Investor that is a party to the MD
Investors Commitment Letter pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Equity Comment
Letter and (z) an assignment or delegation by the MSDC Investor pursuant to
Section 3(a) of the MSDC Investor Commitment Letter, Parent shall not provide
such written consent without the prior written consent of the Company (which
written consent of the Company shall not unreasonably be withheld in the
circumstances described in Section 5.13).

 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall ( _i_ ) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and, to the Knowledge of the Parent Parties,
the reason therefor and ( _ii_ ) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and in any
event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative debt
financing (in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable Debt Financing)
from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions no less favorable
to the Parent Parties than such unavailable Debt Financing (including the
"flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter). For the purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing Commitments"
and "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) or commitment or any fee letter referred to in such commitment
letter with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance with
this _Section 5.12(c)_ (and any Debt Commitment Letter, Debt Financing
Commitment and Fee Letter remaining in effect at the time in question).

 



61 (d) In the event that any portion of the Subordinated Securities Financing
becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall ( _i_ )
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the reason therefor and ( _ii_ ) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and
in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative
debt financing (in an amount sufficient to replace such unavailable
Subordinated Securities Financing) from the same or other sources and on
terms and conditions no less favorable to the Parent Parties than such
unavailable Subordinated Securities Financing. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "Securities Purchase Agreement" and "Subordinated
Securities Financing Commitment" shall be deemed to include any purchase
agreement (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance with this _Section 5.12(d)_ (and any
Securities Purchase Agreement and Subordinated Securities Financing Commitment
remaining in effect at the time in question).

(e) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice ( _i_
) of ( _x_ ) any material breach or default by any party to any Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Agreements of which any Parent Party has Knowledge
or any termination of any of the Commitment Letters, ( _y_ ) the receipt of
any written notice or other written communication to any Parent Party from any
Lender, Equity Investor, Subordinated Securities Purchaser, MD Investor, MSDC
Investor or other financing source with respect to any actual or threatened
breach, default, (or any accusation of breach or default), termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements or any provision thereof or ( _z_ ) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among the Parent Parties, on the one hand, and the
Lenders on the other hand, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, among any Lenders
to any of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements with respect to
the obligation to fund any of the Financing or the amount of the Financing to
be funded at Closing, and ( _ii_ ) if at any time for any reason any
Parent Party believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or
any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will any
Parent Party be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to
clauses ( _x_ ) or ( _z_ ) that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if the Parent Parties shall have used their reasonable best efforts
to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. In
the event that the Parent Parties do not provide access or information in
reliance on the preceding sentence, the Parent Parties shall provide notice
to the Company that such access or information is being withheld and the
Parent Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to communicate,
to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not
violate the applicable obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of
its efforts to consummate the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to _Section 8.5(b)_, compliance by the Parent Parties with this
_Section 5.12_ shall not relieve any Parent Party of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not
the Financing is available.

 



62 (f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation

Financing, which reasonable best efforts shall include:

Material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
Nothing contained in this _Section 5.12(f)_ or otherwise shall require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or

or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective intellectual property rights.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.12_ shall require, and in no event shall

construed to require, any of the Parent Parties to ( _i_ ) pay any fees to
the Lenders in excess of those contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and
related fee letters (including the "flex" provisions thereof) as of the date
hereof, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein

of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Persons who
beneficially own no or a de minimis number of Shares, and ( _z_ ) with the
written consent of the Company, other Persons. 

Section 5.14 _Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation_. The
Company shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent
Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company, of ( _i_ ) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger, or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Parent Parties, and ( _ii_ ) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or

give Parent the opportunity to participate in such Shareholder Litigation,
consult with counsel to the Special Committee and the Company regarding the

settle any such Shareholder Litigation without Parents prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.15 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including

Structured Financing Debt Facility otherwise permitted under this Agreement);
provided that in no event shall this  _Section 5.16(d)_ require the Company

_x_ ) pay any fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not reimbursed
by Parent, promptly after when requested by the Company, or incur any other

71 Section 5.17 _Liquidation of Investments; Cash Transfers_.

 

(a) On the 15th Business Day prior to the last day of ( _i_ ) the Marketing
Period, or ( _ii_ ) such earlier date on which Parent proposes to consummate
the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2, Parent shall provide to the
Company a notice setting forth Parents good faith estimate of the date on
which the Closing will occur in accordance with  _Section 1.2_ (the "
_Estimated Closing Date_ "), which notice shall set forth Parents
determination as to whether Parent is aware of any Legal Impediment or Charge
and, if so, such notice will describe such Legal Impediment or Charge and
shall state whether Parent will terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iii)(B)_; it being understood and agreed that the failure to so state
shall constitute a waiver of its rights to terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iii)(B)_ as a result of such Legal Impediment or
Charge. Parent shall be deemed to have waived its rights to terminate the
Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iii)(B) as a result of any Legal
Impediment or Charge that is not specified on such notice and of which Parent
reasonably should have been aware. Upon receipt of such notice, to the extent
permitted by Law and subject to the reasonable operational requirements of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to ( _x_ ) sell for cash, with
effect as of a date reasonably proximate to the Closing Date, marketable
securities and cash equivalents held by, or on behalf of or for the benefit
of, the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Investments
Liquidation_ "), and ( _y_ ) transfer from Subsidiaries (whether through
loans, loan repayments, dividends, distributions or other transfers), prior
to the Effective Time, an amount of Available Cash to the Company (the " _Cash
Transfers_ "), in as Tax- and cost-efficient method as is reasonably
practicable taking into account the working capital requirements of the
Companys Subsidiaries, with a view towards making available at the Effective
Time no less than the Target Amount of Cash on Hand, it being understood that
nothing in this _Section 5.17_ shall impose any obligation on the Company to
effect any Cash Transfers in excess of $8.1 billion. The Company shall not be
required to effect any Cash Transfer that would violate, or subject the
Company or any Subsidiary to, any Legal Impediment or Charge. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep Parent and its
Representatives reasonably informed regarding the planning and status of the
Cash Transfers and to consult with Parent and its Representatives in good
faith in advance on the method of completing the Cash Transfers. The Company
may, at its discretion, take the actions described in clauses (x) and (y) of
the second sentence of this _Section 5.17(a)_ prior to receipt of the
notice described in the first sentence hereof.

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.17(a)_, without the prior written
approval of Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, knowingly take any action, or knowingly permit any action
to be taken, except in each case in the ordinary course of business, that (
_i_ ) would reasonably be expected to increase in any material respect the
amount of any Taxes, or other costs or expenses, incurred or to be incurred in
connection with the Cash Transfers or ( _ii_ ) restrains, delays or hinders,
or would reasonably be expected to restrain, delay or hinder, in any material
respect the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to effect the Cash
Transfers in compliance with Law.

 



72 (c) The Company shall certify and provide reasonable supporting evidence of
the amount of Cash on Hand as of the close of business on the Cash Delivery
Date and the opening of business on the Closing Date and/or any date that the
Closing would have been required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2 but for the
failure of the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(d)_.

(d) For the purposes of this _Section 5.17_, "Available Cash" means the cash
that (prior to the Cash Transfers, but after giving effect to the Investments
Liquidation) is held by one or more Subsidiaries of the Company and that is in
excess of the amount reasonably necessary, in the good faith determination
of the Company, to be maintained by such Subsidiary as working capital to
conduct its operations.

Section 5.18 _Works Councils_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate, assist and consult with the Parent Parties in
relation to ascertaining the extent to which (if any) the provision of
information to, and/or consultation with, the Companys or its Subsidiaries
employees and their representatives is required in connection with any of this
Agreement, the Merger, the Financing or the other transactions contemplated
herein, and the Company shall consult with the Parent Parties with respect to
information to be provided therewith. This obligation shall include the timely
confirmation to the Parent Parties of whether any local or national level
collective agreements with trade unions, works councils or other employee
representative bodies exist, and the provision to the Parent Parties of copies
of any such agreements to the extent that they may impact on any partys
obligations to inform and/or consult with employees or their representatives.
Each party shall arrange and facilitate or continue discussions with the
Companys or its Subsidiaries employees and/or their representatives in a
timely manner to enable the parties to fully comply with their obligations in
this regard. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall provide
any information to any employee or employee representative ( _i_ ) pursuant to
any obligation it has to provide information to them or consult with them
arising out of the Merger or this Agreement or ( _ii_ ) in connection with
the intentions of the Parent Parties regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case without first consulting with Parent.

 

Section 5.19 _De-Listing_. The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Parent to cause the shares of Common Stock to be
de-listed from the NASDAQ and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

anything to the contrary in the foregoing, unless the Parent Termination Fee
has been paid, the Parent Parties shall remain liable hereunder and each of
the Guarantors shall remain liable under their respective Limited Guarantees
for such Guarantors portion of any Other Guaranteed Amounts until such time
as such Guarantors Limited Guarantee terminates in accordance with its terms.

 

(e) Without limiting or otherwise affecting any way the remedies available to

Section 8.5 _Remedies; Specific Enforcement_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages may not
be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages) to ( _i_ ) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and/or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and ( _ii_ ) an injunction or injunctions restraining such
breach or threatened breach.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to the granting of a decree or order of specific performance or other
equitable relief of Parents obligation to cause the full funding of ( _x_ )
the Equity Financing under the Equity Investors Commitment Letter, ( _y_ )
the Rollover Investment under the MD Investors Commitment Letter and ( _z_ )
the MSDC Financing under the MSDC Investor Commitment Letter and to consummate
the Merger if and only in the event each of the

 



84  following conditions has been satisfied: ( _i_ ) all of the conditions in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which at such time is capable of
being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, ( _ii_ ) each of the Debt
Financing and the Subordinated Securities Financing, or in each case
alternative financing obtained in accordance with _Section 5.12_, has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing, Rollover
Investment and MSDC Financing are funded at the Closing, ( _iii_ ) the
Marketing Period has ended and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the
Closing when required pursuant to _Section 1.2_ and ( _iv_ ) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent, the Lenders and the
Subordinated Securities Purchaser that it is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing and that if decree or order of specific performance or
other equitable relief is granted and the Equity Financing, the Rollover
Investment, the MSDC Financing, the Debt Financing and the Subordinated
Securities Financing are funded, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of a decree or order of
specific performance or other equitable relief as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this  _Section 8.5(b)_ with respect to the matters
identified in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above and to consummate the Merger and
the payment of the Cash Shortfall Fee or the Parent Termination Fee (only to
the extent expressly permitted by _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_,
respectively), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both ( _A_ ) such grant of a decree or order of specific
performance or other equitable relief to cause the funding of the financing
described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above and to consummate the Merger and (
_B_ ) payment of either the Cash Shortfall Fee or Parent Termination Fee.

 

(c) Each party further agrees that ( _i_ ) it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein (including the limitations set forth in _Section 8.5(b)_) on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and
( _ii_ ) no other party or any other Person shall not be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section 8.5_, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

Section 8.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND
