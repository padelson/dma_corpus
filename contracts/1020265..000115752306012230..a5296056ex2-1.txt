effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,

                 Section 2.6   Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger

               Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates

                 Section 3.1   Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the
Company or its stockholders, the following shall occur.

                    Section 3.1.1   Conversion Generally. Each share of Company
               Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
               Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to
               be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2 and any shares of Company
               Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares") which are held by stockholders
               exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
               ("Dissenting Stockholders")), shall be converted, subject to
               Section 3.2.4, into the right to receive $32.75 in cash, payable
               to the holder thereof, without interest (the "Merger
               Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
               longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
               retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which
               immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares

                                       10
<PAGE>

               shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger
               Consideration therefor. Certificates previously representing
               shares of Company Common Stock (other than any shares of Company
               Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2) shall be
               exchanged for the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon
               the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with the
               provisions of Section 3.2.

                    Section 3.1.2   Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share
               of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any
               Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the
               Company or by any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
               Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
               conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect
               thereto. Following the Effective Time, each certificate
               evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock shall
               evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

                    Section 3.1.3   Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par
               value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
               immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
               and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and
               nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                    Section 3.1.4   Change in Shares. If between the date of
               this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
               Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
               number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
               dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
               reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other
               similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
               correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
               subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
               split, combination or exchange of shares and to provide to the
               holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
               contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, provided,
               that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company to
               take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
               or not expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

                 Section 3.2   Exchange of Certificates.

                    Section 3.2.1   Paying Agent. At the Closing, Parent shall
               deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
               company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
               Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
               shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
               this Article 3, through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in
               an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
               Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
               "Exchange Fund") payable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for
               outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent
               shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
               Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1 out
               of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
               Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that: (i)
               no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
               Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and
               following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional
               funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of the
               shares of the Company Common Stock in the amount of any such
               losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or

                                       11

               guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
               instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
               of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
               rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
               Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates
               of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
               commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the
               most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
               publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest
               or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the
               Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. The Exchange
               Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

                    Section 3.2.2   Exchange Procedures. Promptly following the
               Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business
               Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the
               Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
               certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
               represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
               "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
               (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
               loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
               delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be
               subject to the consent of the Company prior to the Effective
               Time, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and (ii)
               instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
               Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
               surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent
               together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and
               duly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably
               required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are
               held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
               through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such
               shares on a book-entry account statement (it being understood
               that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to
               include references to book-entry account statements relating to
               the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)), the holder of
               such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
               therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right
               to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
               formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
               surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid
               or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of
               Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
               of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
               records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to
               a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
               Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent,
               accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
               transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
               have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
               3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
               Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
               surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to demand to be
               paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby as
               contemplated by Section 3.3.

                    Section 3.2.3   Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All
               Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof
               shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
               rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

                    Section 3.2.4   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of
               the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
               Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time
               shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and
               any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
               complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to the
               Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration, without any
               interest thereon.

                    Section 3.2.5   No Liability. None of Parent, the Company or
               the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares
               of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund
               delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
               property, escheat or similar Law.

                    Section 3.2.6   Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall
               have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
               affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
               be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
               posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
               customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
               claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost,
               stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
               exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
               Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

                    Section 3.2.7   Withholding. Parent, the Surviving
               Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
               withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
               this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, holder of
               Company Options or holder of a Company Stock-Based Award such
               amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
               are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
               provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the
               making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
               withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
               Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
               this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
               Common Stock, holder of Company Options or holder of a Company
               Stock-Based Award in respect of whom such deduction and
               withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
               Paying Agent.

                 Section 3.3   Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be
paid the "fair value" of its Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this
Section 3.3) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares, in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in accordance with
Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses the right to dissent. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand
for payment of fair value of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. The
Company shall give Parent notice thereof prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall have the right to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL)
or lost the right to dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting
Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1.

                 Section 3.4   Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the
items contemplated by this Article 3) and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On
or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration.

                 Section 3.5   Company Options and Stock-Based Awards.

                    Section 3.5.1   Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
               Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
               thereof) (the "Company Board") shall, in accordance with the
               terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan and consistent with
               the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, take all actions
               necessary and appropriate to provide that, concurrent with the
               Effective Time: (i) each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised
               option to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Company Options")
               granted under the employee and director stock plans of the
               Company or under any individual consultant, employee or director
               agreement (the "Company Stock Plans"), whether or not then
               exercisable, conditioned or vested, shall fully vest and be
               deemed to be exercised and cancelled and each holder of a Company
               Option shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in
               consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such
               Company Option, a payment by the Surviving Corporation (or, at
               Parent's option, Parent) in cash (subject to any applicable
               withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
               withheld), in an amount equal to the product of (x) the total
               number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
               Option (determined on the basis that such Company Option is fully
               vested and currently exercisable) and (y) the excess, if any, of
               the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of
               Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (such amounts
               payable hereunder being referred to as the "Option Payments");
               and (ii) each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
               receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
               the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each
               award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock,
               granted under Company Stock Plans (including stock appreciation
               rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock
               units, performance shares and dividend equivalents), other than
               Company Options (each, a "Company Stock-Based Award"), whether or

               Company Stock-Based Award providing for such beneficiary to
               receive shares of Company Common Stock shall, in lieu thereof, be
               entitled to, and shall be paid pursuant to Section 3.2, the
               Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1.1 of this Agreement
               in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. At and after
               the Effective Time, each Company Option shall be cancelled and
               terminated and shall only entitle such holder to payment of the
               Option Payment as described in this Section 3.5.

                  Representations and Warranties of the Company

                 Subject to (i) any information contained, or incorporated by
reference, in any of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2005 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2006, each as filed prior to the date hereof, other than
information in the "Risk Factors" section of such Company SEC Filings and any
other disclosures included in such filings that are predictive or
forward-looking in nature (provided, that the exception under this clause (i)
shall not apply to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1,
4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6 and 4.18) and to (ii) such exceptions as are disclosed in the
disclosure schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") delivered by the Company
to Parent concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (it
being understood that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply to the indicated Section of this
Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other Section of
this Agreement, and (b) the disclosure of any matter or item in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that
such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein or is material to a
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement and shall not be used as
a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially," "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or any word or phrase of similar import and
does not mean that such matter or item would, alone or together with any other
matter or item, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

                 Section 4.1   Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a
"Company Subsidiary") has been duly organized, and is validly existing and,
where such concept is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, except to
the extent the failure of any such Company Subsidiary to be in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete list
of all of the Company Subsidiaries. The Company and each Company Subsidiary has
the requisite power and authority and all governmental approvals and Company
Permits necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except for such government approvals, the
absence of which, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification,
licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational
documents) of the Company and each material Company Subsidiary, and all
amendments thereto, as currently in effect.

               options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
               commitments of any character to which the Company or any Company
               Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company
               Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued Equity
               Interests of the Company, or securities convertible into or
               exchangeable for such Equity Interests, or obligating the Company
               to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other Equity
               Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
               such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company.
               Except as set forth in Section 4.2.1, there are no outstanding
               contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
               affecting the voting rights of or requiring the repurchase,
               redemption or disposition of, any Equity Interests in the
               Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.2.1, since November 30,
               2006 through the date hereof, the Company has not issued any
               shares of its capital stock, or securities convertible into or
               exchangeable for such capital stock or any other Equity Interests
               in the Company.

                    Section 4.2.3   Each outstanding share of capital stock or
               other Equity Interest of each Company Subsidiary is duly
               authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
               preemptive rights and is held, directly or indirectly, by the
               Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all
               claims, liens and encumbrances. Except as set forth in Section
               4.2.1, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights,
               calls, contracts or other commitments, understandings,
               restrictions or arrangements relating to the issuance or sale
               with respect to any shares of capital stock or other ownership
               interests of any Company Subsidiary, including any right of
               conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument
               or agreement. Section 4.2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
               sets forth all material Equity Interests owned, directly or
               indirectly, by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in any
               Person other than a Company Subsidiary.

                    Section 4.3.1   The Company has all necessary corporate
               power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
               perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the

               delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by
               the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
               duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
               no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no
               stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
               consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than, with
               respect to the Merger, the affirmative vote of holders of a
               majority of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to adopt
               this Agreement and approve the transactions provided for herein
               (the "Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement has been duly
               authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
               assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of
               Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
               and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
               Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
               insolvency (including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers),
               reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
               applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
               general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity
               Exception").

                    Section 4.3.2   The Company has taken all appropriate
               actions so that the restrictions on business combinations
               contained in Section 203 of the DGCL will not apply with respect
               to or as a result of this Agreement and the transactions
               contemplated hereby, including the Merger, without any further
               action on the part of the stockholders or the Company Board.

                 Section 4.4   No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

                    Section 4.4.1   The execution, delivery and performance by
               the Company of this Agreement does not (i) assuming the
               Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any
               provision of the Company Certificate or the Company By-laws or
               any equivalent organizational documents of any Company
               Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
               authorizations described in Section 4.4.2 will have been obtained
               prior to the Effective Time and all filings and notifications
               described in Section 4.4.2 will have been made and any waiting

               Effective Time, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
               the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or
               asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
               affected or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result
               in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute
               a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
               would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
               termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
               or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of
               the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract
               to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
               which any of their respective properties or assets are bound,
               except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for matters that,
               individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably expected to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               materially delay the consummation of the Merger, (b) otherwise
               prevent or materially delay performance by the Company of any of
               its material obligations under the Agreement or (c) individually

                 Section 4.6   SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                    Section 4.6.1   Company SEC Filings. The Company has timely
               filed or furnished to or with the SEC all forms, reports,
               statements, certification and other documents required to be
               filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange
               Act, as the case may be, since December 31, 2005 (collectively,
               the "Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing, including
               any information incorporated by reference therein, (i) as of its
               date, complied in all material respects with the applicable
               requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and/or the
               Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not, at the
               time it was filed (or, if amended, at the time of such
               amendment), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
               omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
               necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
               light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

                                       18

               misleading. No Company Subsidiary is subject to the periodic
               reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. No executive officer
               of the Company has failed in any respect to make the
               certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of
               the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Filing.
               The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and
               complete copies of all written correspondence between the SEC, on
               the one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
               other hand, occurring since December 31, 2005. As of the date of
               this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
               in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to
               the Company SEC Filing. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of
               the Company SEC Filing is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
               outstanding SEC comments.

                    Section 4.6.2   Financial Statements. Each of the
               consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
               notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings
               (collectively, the "Company Financial Statements") was prepared
               in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be indicated in
               the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
               financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the
               Exchange Act) on a consistent basis during the periods indicated
               (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each
               presented fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
               financial position of the Company as of the respective dates
               thereof and the consolidated income, shareholders equity, results
               of operations and changes to consolidated financial position or
               cash flows of the Company for the respective periods indicated
               therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
               adjustments which, individually or in the aggregate, are not
               reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect).
               All of the Company Subsidiaries are consolidated with the Company
               for accounting purposes.

                    Section 4.6.3   Availability of Cash. Other than temporary
               restrictions on repatriation imposed by applicable Law or
               obligations in connection with Indebtedness, to the Knowledge of
               the Company, there is no restriction that would materially impair
               the Company's ability to use its cash for payment of the Merger
               Consideration at the time of Closing.

                    Section 4.6.4   No Undisclosed Liabilities. None of the
               Company or any consolidated Company Subsidiary has any
               liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether accrued,
               absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become due
               and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected on a
               balance sheet or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with
               GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations (i) which,
               individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably expected to
               have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) that were incurred
               under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
               contemplated hereby and consistent with Section 6.1 or (iii) that
               were disclosed or reserved against in the Company Financial
               Statements.

                    Section 4.6.5   Internal Controls. Since January 1, 2004,
               the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
               financial officer have disclosed to the Company's auditors and
               the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
               deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
               of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
               likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,

                                       19

               process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
               fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
               employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal
               controls and the Company has provided to Parent copies of any
               material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company
               has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
               (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act);
               such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
               that material information relating to the Company required to be
               included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
               consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's
               principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
               by others within those entities, particularly during the periods
               in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
               being prepared, and, to the knowledge of the Company, such
               disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
               alerting the Company's principal executive officer and its
               principal financial officer to material information required to
               be included in the Company's periodic reports required under the
               Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
               neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any
               prohibited loans to any executive officer of the Company (as
               defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the
               Company or any Company Subsidiary.

                    Section 4.6.6   Since December 31, 2003, (i) neither the
               Company nor the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the
               Company, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
               representative of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
               has received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
               claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
               methodologies or methods of the Company or any of the Company
               Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls and
               (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of the Company
               Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of
               the Company Subsidiaries, has reported to the Company Board or
               any committee thereof evidence of a material violation of
               securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
               the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
               agents.

                 Section 4.7   Affiliate Transactions. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no transactions, or series of related transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are there any currently proposed
transactions, or series of related transactions, that are required to be
disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act
that have not been otherwise disclosed in the Company SEC Filings.

                 Section 4.8   Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, since December 31, 2005
and prior to the date hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice. Since December 31, 2005, there has not been any (i) Company

               of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, is any such audit or
               investigation pending or threatened.

                    Section 4.9.3   Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended
               to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
               determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified, and,
               to the Company's Knowledge, no fact or event has occurred since
               the date of such determination letter that has or could
               materially adversely affect the qualified status of any such
               Company Benefit Plan.

                    Section 4.9.4   Neither the Company nor any trade or
               business that, together with the Company, would be deemed a
               single employer within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (an
               "ERISA Affiliate") maintains or contributes to, is obligated to
               maintain or contribute to, or has maintained or contributed to,
               any Multiemployer Plan, Multiple Employer Plan or any "defined
               benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) subject to
               Section 302 of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of

               purposes has been or is expected by the Company or any Company
               Subsidiary to be disallowed for remuneration paid by the Company
               or any Company Subsidiary by reason of Section 162(m) of the
               Code, including by reason of the transactions contemplated

               this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
               contemplated by this Agreement will, either alone or in
               conjunction with any other event (whether contingent or
               otherwise), (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or
               payable, or required to be provided, to any director, officer,
               employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Company
               Subsidiary, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or

               result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or
               funding of any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any
               amount to fail to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the
               Code.

               "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
               Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a "Nonqualified Deferred
               Compensation Plan") subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
               operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since
               January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable
               interpretation of (A) Section 409A of the Code and (B)(1) the
               proposed regulations issued thereunder or (2) Internal Revenue

               Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan subject to Section 409A

               applicable to Section 409A of the Code, as set forth in Section
               885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as amended (the

               Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based

               409A Authorities.

               is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor contracts
               and no collective bargaining agreement or other labor contract is
               being negotiated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There
               is no pending, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company or any
               Company Subsidiary, threatened, labor dispute, strike, lockout or
               work stoppage against the Company or any Company Subsidiary which
               may interfere with the respective business activities of the
               Company or the Company Subsidiaries, except where such dispute,
               strike or work stoppage, individually or in the aggregate, is not
               reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
               There is no pending charge or complaint against the Company or
               any Company Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or
               any comparable Governmental Entity, except where such unfair
               labor practice, charge or complaint, individually or in the
               aggregate, is not reasonably expected to have a Company Material
               Adverse Effect.

               Subsidiary has, within the last three years, effectuated (i) a

               Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as
               defined in the WARN Act, or any similar Law) affecting any site

                 Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the disclosure
schedule (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") delivered by Parent to the Company
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (it being
understood that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall apply to the indicated Section of this
Agreement and any other Section of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other Section of
this Agreement, and (b) disclosure of any matter or item in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement that
such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein or is material to a
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement and shall not be used as
a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "materially" or "materiality" or
any word or phrase of similar import), Parent and Merger Sub jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

                 Section 5.1   Organization and Qualification. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary. Parent
has heretofore made available to the Company complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Parent and Merger Sub, together with
all amendments thereto, as currently in effect.

                 Section 5.2   Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all

Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
provided for herein have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and no vote of Parent's
stockholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions provided for herein. This Agreement has been duly authorized and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the other
Parties, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

                    Section 5.3.1   The execution, delivery and performance by
               Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do not (i) conflict with
               or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
               by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents,
               approvals and authorizations described in Section 4.4.2 will have
               been obtained prior to the Effective Time and all filings and
               notifications described in Section 4.4.2 will have been made and
               any waiting periods thereunder will have terminated or expired

               affected or (iii) result in any breach of, any loss of any
               benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which with
               notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or
               give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration
               or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
               property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to any
               Contract.

                    Section 5.3.2   The execution, delivery and performance by
               Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do not require any
               consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
               notification to, any Governmental Entity or other Person, except
               (i) under the Exchange Act, any applicable Blue Sky Laws, the
               rules and regulations of the NYSE, the HSR Act, ECMR or any other
               antitrust, competition, trade or other regulatory Laws, (ii) the
               filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required
               by the DGCL, and (iii) as would not prevent or materially delay
               the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

action, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is

arbitration or investigation pending or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or Merger Sub which seeks to, or would reasonably be expected to,
restrain, enjoin or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions provided for herein or which seeks damages in connection therewith
and no injunction has been entered or issued with respect to the transactions
provided for herein.

                 Section 5.5   Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities.
Parent owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for obligations or
liabilities incurred in connection with its formation and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred,
directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliate, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever
or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

                 Section 5.6   Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company
true, complete and correct signed counterpart(s) of (i) the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) the Limited Guarantee and (iii) the debt commitment letter(s), and
any related fee letter(s) or any provisions relating to "market flex" in such
fee letter(s), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Sovereign Holdings,
Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch;
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.; Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation and Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, pursuant to which the lenders party
thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to
provide or cause to be provided, the debt financing set forth therein in
connection with the transactions provided for herein to Parent (as the same may
be amended pursuant to Section 6.14 the "Debt Commitment Letters" and, together
with the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited Guarantee, the "Commitments").
As of the date hereof, except as permitted by Section 6.14, none of the
Commitments has been amended and such Commitments are (solely to the Knowledge
of Parent and Merger Sub, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letters) in full
force and effect. The Commitments are subject to no contingencies or conditions
other than those set forth in the copies thereof delivered to the Company. No
event has occurred (solely to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub in the case
of the Debt Commitment Letters) which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
under any term or condition of the Commitments. As of the date hereof, Parent

                                       30
<PAGE>

has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
term or condition of Closing that is required to be satisfied by it as a
condition of the Commitments or that the financing contemplated by the
Commitments will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment fees and other fees required by the
Commitments to be paid as of the date hereof. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Commitments and this Agreement, the Commitments together with
cash on hand of the Company on the Closing Date would provide Parent with
financing at the Effective Time sufficient to (i) consummate the Merger upon the
terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) effect any other repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in connection with the Merger or the
Commitments and (iii) pay all related fees and expenses.

                 Section 5.7   Vote Required. No vote of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock or other Equity Interests of Parent or Merger
Sub is necessary to approve the Merger.

                 Section 5.8   Brokers. No broker, finder, financial advisor,
investment banker or other Person (other than Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated), the fees and expenses of
which will be paid by Parent) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

                 Section 5.9   Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

                 Section 5.10   Solvency of the Surviving Corporation. As of the
Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of the conditions to Parent's obligation
to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and after giving effect
to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and actions taken in
connection with the financing of these transactions, the Surviving Corporation
shall be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation
shall be deemed "Solvent" so long as, as of the Effective Time: (i) each of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have incurred debts beyond
its ability to pay such debts as they mature or become due, (ii) the then
present fair salable value of the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will exceed the amount that will be required to pay their
liabilities (including the amount necessary to provide for contingent
liabilities) and their respective debts as they become absolute and mature,
(iii) the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in
each case at a fair valuation, will exceed their respective debts (including the
amount necessary to provide for contingent liabilities) and (iv) each of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have unreasonably small
capital to carry on their respective business, either (a) as presently conducted
or (b) as intended by Parent to be conducted. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
present or future creditors of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

               Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and shall not have

               orally and in writing of the Company's receipt of any request for
               information or any Takeover Proposal and the material terms and
               conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal. Promptly upon
               determination by the Company Board that a Takeover Proposal
               constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver to
               Parent a written notice advising it that the Company Board has
               made such determination, specifying the material terms and
               conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the
               Person making such Superior Proposal.

                    Section 6.4.4   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
               contained herein, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prohibit or
               restrict the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and/or
               disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
               contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
               (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if,
               in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, such disclosure
               would be necessary under applicable Law (including Rule 14d-9 and
               Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act); provided,
               however, that in no event shall this Section 6.4.4 affect the
               obligations of the Company specified in Section 6.4.2.

               waiting period thereunder)), (iii) defending all lawsuits or
               other legal, regulatory or other proceedings to which it is a
               party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation
               of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
               until the issuance of a final, non-appealable Order, (iv) seeking
               to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order
               or other Order which may adversely affect the ability of the

               Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final,
               non-appealable Order.

                    Section 6.5.2   At the request of Parent (which request,
               subject to Section 6.5.1, may be based on Parent's sole
               discretion), the Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or
               otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
               freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or its
               ability to retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets,
               properties or services of the Company or any of the Company
               Subsidiaries; provided, that any such action may be conditioned
               upon the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
               contemplated by this Agreement.

                    Section 6.5.3   Each Party shall furnish all information
               required to be included in any application or other filing to be
               made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental

               Entity in connection with the transactions provided for in this
               Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review
               in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will
               consult the other on, all the information relating to the other
               and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that
               appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
               to, any Third Party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
               the Merger.

                    Section 6.5.4   Each Party shall (i) subject to Section
               6.5.5 below, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable under
               the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC or the
               Antitrust Division and to all inquiries and requests received
               from any State Attorney General, the EC or other Governmental
               Entity in connection with Regulatory Approvals and antitrust
               matters, (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
               ECMR (except with the prior written consent of the other Parties
               hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
               delayed) and (iii) not enter into any agreement with the FTC, the
               Antitrust Division or the EC not to consummate the Merger and the
               transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                    Section 6.5.5   In connection with and without limiting the
               foregoing, each Party shall, subject to applicable Law and except
               as prohibited by any applicable representative of any applicable
               Governmental Entity: (a) promptly notify the other Parties of any
               written communication to that Party from the FTC, the Antitrust
               Division, any State Attorney General, the EC or any other
               Governmental Entity, including regulatory authorities, and permit
               the other Parties to review in advance (and to consider any
               comments made by the other Parties in relation to) any proposed
               written communication to any of the foregoing; (b) not agree to
               participate or participate in any substantive meeting or
               discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
               filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
               the Merger unless it consults with the other Parties in advance
               and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
               the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
               thereat; and (c) furnish the other Parties with copies of all
               correspondence, filings, and written communications (and
               memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and
               its Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
               hand, and any Governmental Entity, including any regulatory
               authority, or members or their respective staffs on the other
               hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger.

                    Section 6.5.6   Subject to the terms and conditions herein
               provided, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and each of Parent
               and Merger Sub shall cause each member of the Parent Group not
               to, take or cause or permit to be taken any action (including the
               acquisition of businesses or assets) which would reasonably be
               expected to materially delay, restrict or prevent consummation of
               the Merger.

                 Section 6.6   Certain Notices. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each Party hereto shall promptly notify the
other Party of (i) the existence of any event or circumstance that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the
Merger and the other transactions provided for in this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (ii) the failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any

                                       40
<PAGE>

Party to effect the Merger and the other transactions provided for in this
Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter at or prior to
the execution of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

                 Section 6.7   Public Announcements. None of the Parties shall
(and each of the Parties shall cause its Representatives and, in the case of
Parent, the other members of the Parent Group, if applicable, not to) issue any
press release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of
(i) the Company, in the event the disclosing party is Parent, Merger Sub, any
other member of the Parent Group, if applicable, or any of their respective
Representatives, or (ii) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company or any of its Representatives, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that if a Party determines, based upon
advice of counsel, that disclosure is required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party is
listed, such Party may make such disclosure to the extent so required; provided,
further, that such disclosure is made in consultation with the other Parties to
this Agreement.

                 Section 6.8   Employee Matters.

                    Section 6.8.1   In addition to the matters set forth in this
               Section 6.8, the Parties hereby agree to the matters set forth on
               Section 6.8.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to
               employee matters.

                    Section 6.8.2   Obligations with Respect to Continuing
               Employees. Parent hereby agrees that, for the period immediately
               following the Effective Time through and including the one (1)
               year anniversary of the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall
               cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i)
               provide each Continuing Employee with at least the same level of
               base salary or wages and targeted annual incentive opportunity
               and on substantially the same terms and conditions as was
               provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
               Effective Time, and (ii) maintain Surviving Corporation Benefit
               Plans providing benefits (except to the extent any such plan
               provides equity-based compensation) that are substantially no
               less favorable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the
               Continuing Employees pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans in
               effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Consistent with
               the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
               or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
               honor in accordance with their terms as in effect on the date
               hereof all Contracts, agreements, arrangements, programs,
               policies, plans and commitments of the Company and the Company
               Subsidiaries, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
               Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
               directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including
               without limitation the severance plans and policies adopted by
               the Company Board. In addition, Parent hereby agrees that for the
               period immediately following the Effective Time through and
               including the two (2) year anniversary of the Effective Time, it
               shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
               Subsidiaries to, continue to maintain the Company's severance
               policies as in effect at the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall
               be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Continuing
               Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation
               or its Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee. Nothing
               herein shall be deemed to constitute an amendment of any Company
               Benefit Plan or to prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of
               its Subsidiaries from making any change in any Company Benefit
               Plan, including any change required by Law or deemed necessary or
               appropriate to comply with applicable law or regulation.

                    Section 6.8.3   Credit for Service. Continuing Employees
               shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate
               and vesting (but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation
               and severance, if applicable) under any Surviving Corporation
               Benefit Plan under which each Continuing Employee may be eligible
               to participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent
               recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
               under comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the
               Effective Time; provided, however, that such crediting of service
               shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any
               such benefit.

                    Section 6.8.4   Welfare Plans. With respect to any Surviving
               Corporation Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, program
               or arrangement (a "Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan") and in which
               a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after
               the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
               Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, or use
               commercially reasonable efforts to cause its insurance carrier to
               waive, all limitations as to pre-existing, waiting period or
               actively-at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
               participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
               Continuing Employee under such Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to
               the same extent waived under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in
               which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to
               the Effective Time, and (ii) provide credit to each Continuing
               Employee (and his/her beneficiaries) for any co-payments,
               deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing
               Employee (and his/her beneficiaries) under the comparable Company
               Benefit Plan during the relevant plan year, up to and including
               the Effective Time.

                 Section 6.9   Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

                    Section 6.9.1   From and after the Effective Time until six
               (6) years from the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by
               Law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
               Surviving Corporation and the comparable organizational documents
               of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable
               with respect to the elimination of liability of directors and
               indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents in
               office on or prior to the date hereof than are set forth in the
               Company Certificate and the Company By-laws (or the equivalent
               documents of the relevant Company Subsidiary) as in effect on the
               date hereof; provided, however, that in the event any claim or
               claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the
               protections of such provisions within such six (6) year period,
               such provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition
               of any such claims.

                    Section 6.9.2   From and after the Effective Time, Parent
               and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, shall
               indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
               under applicable Law and, without limiting the foregoing, as
               required pursuant to any indemnity agreements of the Company or
               any Company Subsidiary, each present and former director and
               officer of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (collectively,

                                       42
<PAGE>

               the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses
               (including attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
               losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities incurred in
               connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
               investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
               investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) any and all
               matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the
               Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
               the Effective Time, and (ii) any and all representations and
               warranties made by Parent and/or Merger Sub under Article 5
               hereof, including any matter arising under any claim that the
               transactions contemplated herein, and any actions taken by Parent
               and/or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition
               of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
               which is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation
               and/or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Without limiting the
               foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
               severally, shall also advance costs and expenses (including
               attorneys' fees) as incurred by any Indemnified Party within
               fifteen (15) days after receipt by Parent of a written request
               for such advance, provided, that the Person to whom expenses are
               advanced provides an undertaking in customary form, consistent
               with the practices of the Company prior to the Effective Time, to
               repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
               Person is not entitled to indemnification (it being understood
               and agreed that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
               require the posting of any bond or any other security for such
               undertaking).

                    Section 6.9.3   For a period of six (6) years after the
               Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
               Corporation to maintain in effect the Company's current
               directors' and officers' liability insurance (the "D&O
               Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
               to the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by
               the D&O Insurance (a complete and accurate copy of which has been
               heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with respect to
               the coverage, deductible and amounts no less favorable than those
               of the D&O Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement;
               provided, however, that (i) in satisfying its obligations under
               this Section 6.9.3, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
               shall be obligated to pay an aggregate amount in excess of 300%
               of the annual premium currently paid by the Company (which
               premiums are set forth in Section 6.9.3 of the Company Disclosure
               Schedule), it being understood and agreed that Parent or the
               Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
               the maximum amount of such coverage as may be obtained for such
               300% amount and (ii) in the event of the application of clause
               (i), any present or former officer or director, upon reasonable
               written notice thereof (which notice shall be provided reasonably
               promptly following such Person's knowledge of the application of
               clause (i), and shall set forth in reasonable detail for each
               such Person to be covered the policy coverage, premiums,
               deductibles, limitations and other pertinent information), who
               desires to obtain additional coverage such that, when combined
               with the coverage obtained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
               in accordance with clause (i), it provides insurance coverage
               equivalent to the D&O Insurance in effect on the date hereof, may
               so elect and Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
               Corporation to acquire such additional coverage on behalf of such
               Person; provided, further, that in the event any present or
               former officer or director makes such an election, such former
               officer or director shall pay the portion of the premium of such
               D&O Insurance attributable to his or her election in excess of
               the amount which Parent or the Surviving Corporation is obligated

                                       43
<PAGE>

               to pay pursuant to this Section 6.9. The Company may, and at
               Parent's request shall use its reasonable best efforts to,
               acquire a six year tail policy for Persons currently covered by
               D&O Insurance that is consistent with the first sentence of this
               Section 6.9.3 so long as the one time premium payment for such
               tail policy is not more than 300% of the annual premium currently
               paid by the Company and as set forth in Section 6.9.3 of the
               Company Disclosure Schedule. Such policy shall be prepaid at the
               Effective Time and shall be non-cancelable. If the Company
               acquires such a tail policy, Parent's obligations pursuant to the
               first sentence of this Section 6.9.3 shall be deemed completely
               satisfied. The obligation to maintain insurance provided in this
               Section 6.9.3 shall continue in full force and effect for a
               period of not less than six (6) years from and after the
               Effective Time; provided, that in the event any claim or claims
               are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, Parent or
               the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that such insurance
               remains in full force and effect with respect to such claims
               until final disposition thereof.

                    Section 6.9.4   If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
               any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or
               merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
               surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
               or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
               assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
               provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
               Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or acquiror of such assets),
               as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent
               or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.9.

                    Section 6.9.5   The rights of each Indemnified Party under
               this Section 6.9 shall be in addition to any right such Person
               might have under the Company Certificate and the Company By-laws,
               the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving
               Corporation or any comparable organizational documents of their
               Subsidiaries, or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party
               with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
               respective Subsidiaries.

                    Section 6.9.6   The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall
               survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for
               the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
               Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and representatives.

                 Section 6.10   State Takeover Statutes. Parent, the Company and
their respective Boards of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions
provided for in this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions provided for in this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement.

                 Section 6.11   Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and
permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock) by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                                       44

                 Section 6.12   NDA. The NDA shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time
or (ii) the expiration of the NDA according to its terms.

                 Section 6.13   Solvency of the Surviving Corporation. At or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company an opinion from an
independent expert of nationally recognized reputation, addressed to the Company
Board and dated as of the Closing Date, supporting the conclusion that, after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent (or the equivalent thereof,
as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Company) (such opinion, the
"Solvency Opinion"). Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection
therewith, use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make available their
respective officers, agents and other Representatives on a customary basis and
upon reasonable notice and (ii) provide or make available such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the
Company as may reasonably be requested in connection with delivering the
Solvency Opinion.

                 Section 6.14   Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange, and close concurrently with the Closing, debt financing on terms and
conditions described in or comparable to the Debt Commitment Letters (including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain rating agency approvals, maintain in
effect the Commitments, satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the financing contemplated by the Commitments
(including by consummating the financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter), negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter on terms and conditions contained therein or with respect to any
replacement commitments, satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Sub in such definitive agreements that are within its control and, if necessary,
borrow pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters in the event any "flex"
provisions are exercised). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
comply with the terms of, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the
financing contemplated by the Commitments in accordance with this Section 6.13
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver
of any provision or remedy under, the Commitments without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Company; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may amend
the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitments as
of the date of this Agreement, or otherwise so long as the terms are not less
beneficial in any material respect to Parent or Merger Sub (as reasonably
determined by the Company), including with respect to conditions precedent, than
those in the Commitments as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event that on the final day of the Marketing Period
(x) all or a portion of the debt financing structured as high yield debt or
contemplated to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act has not been
consummated, (y) all conditions to Closing contained in Sections 7.1 and 7.2
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their
nature will not be satisfied until the Closing) and (z) the bridge financing

                                       45
<PAGE>

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or alternative bridge financing) is
available on terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (or
amendments thereof), then on such date Parent shall borrow under and use the
proceeds of the bridge financing (or such alternative bridge financing). Parent
shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the
Commitments, any termination of any of the Commitments or any other
circumstance, event or condition that would reasonably be likely to impede,
prevent or delay the consummation of the financing contemplated by the
Commitments, to the extent it becomes aware of such breach, termination,
circumstance, event or condition. If any portion of the financing contemplated
by the Commitments becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms not materially less
beneficial to Parent and Merger Sub (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event. For the avoidance of doubt, if the financing provided for by the
Commitments has not been or cannot be obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2, the limitations set forth in Section 8.5, and
to Parent's rights under Section 8.1, regardless of whether Parent and Merger
Sub have complied with all of their other obligations under this Agreement
(including their obligations under this Section 6.14).

                 Section 6.15   Cooperation in Securing Financing. From the date
of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary and its and their respective Representatives to, provide
to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation requested by Parent that is reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with obtaining the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters including (i) participation in
meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, offering documents, business projections and similar
marketing documents required in connection with the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) as promptly as practical, furnishing
Parent and its debt financing sources all financial statements, pro forma
financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information of
the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act
and the other accounting rules and regulations of the SEC as may reasonably be
requested by Parent of the type and form customarily included in private
placement memoranda pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act (all such
information in this clause (iii), the "Required Information"), (iv) cooperating
in satisfying the conditions set forth in paragraphs C, D and E of Exhibit E of
the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent the satisfaction of such condition
requires the cooperation of the Company), (v) issuing customary representation
letters to auditors and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (A)
accountants' comfort letters and consents to the use of accountants' audit
reports relating to the Company, (B) legal opinions and (C) other documentation
and items contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as reasonably requested by
Parent; provided that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (vi) promptly providing monthly financial
statements (excluding footnotes) to the extent available and prepared by the
Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (vii)
executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, any pledge and security

                                       46
<PAGE>

documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or
documents contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters (it being
understood and agreed that such Chief Financial Officer may rely on the
representations of Parent in Section 5.10 and on the Solvency Opinion) and
consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters) and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including obtaining
releases, terminations, waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals as may be
required in connection therewith) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
and (viii) as of the Effective Time, taking all corporate actions necessary to
authorize the consummation of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters. The Company will periodically update any such Required
Information to be included in an offering document to be used in connection with
such debt financing so that Parent may ensure that any such offering document
does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters; provided, that notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.15 to the contrary, no officer or director of the Company shall be required to
execute any documents, including, without limitation, any registration statement
to be filed with the SEC, any pledge or security documents or other definitive
financing documents and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability
in connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitments prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in connection with any actions taken pursuant to this
Section 6.15. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Commitments and any information (including all Required
Information) utilized in connection therewith. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
obtained by Parent or the Parent Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.15
shall be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the NDA.

                 For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean
the first period of 30 consecutive calendar days after the Initiation Date (A)
throughout and at the end of which (1) Parent and its financing sources shall
have the Required Information and (2) nothing has occurred and no condition
exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2.1 and
7.2.2 (other than the receipt of the certificates referred to in Section 7.2.3)
to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time
during such 30-consecutive-calendar-day period, and (B) at the end of which the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 shall be satisfied; provided, that (v) the
Marketing Period shall end no earlier than 5 Business Days after the date the
Stockholder Approval is obtained; (w) the Marketing Period shall end on any
earlier date that is the date on which the debt financing is consummated; (x)
for purposes of calculating such 30-consecutive-calendar-day period, August 17
through September 3, 2007 shall not be counted or taken into account; (y) the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the

                                       47
<PAGE>

completion of the Marketing Period, (A) the Company's independent registered
accounting firm shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any
financial statements contained in the Required Information, in which case the
Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence at the earliest unless and until
a new unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to the consolidated
financial statements for the applicable periods by the Company's independent
registered accounting firm or another independent registered accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent, (B) the Company shall have publicly announced
any intention to restate any of its financial information, in which case the
Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence at the earliest unless and until
such restatement has been completed and the Company SEC Filings have been
amended or the Company has announced that it has concluded that no restatement
shall be required in accordance with GAAP or (C) the Company shall have failed
to file any report with the SEC by the date required under the Securities Act,
in which case the Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence at the
earliest unless and until all such reports have been filed; (z) if the financial
statements included in the Required Information that is available to Parent on
the first day of any such 30-consecutive-calendar-day period would not be
sufficiently current on any day during such 30-consecutive-calendar-day period
to permit (i) a registration statement using such financial statements to be
declared effective by the SEC on the last day of the 30-consecutive-calendar-day
period or (ii) the Company's independent registered accounting firm to issue a
customary comfort letter to purchasers (in accordance with its normal practices
and procedures) on the last day of the 30-consecutive-calendar-day period, then
a new 30-consecutive-calendar-day period shall commence upon Parent receiving
updated Required Information that would be sufficiently current to permit the
actions described in (i) and (ii) on the last day of such
30-consecutive-calendar-day period.

                 For purposes of this Agreement, "Initiation Date" shall mean
the later to occur of (A) the date the definitive Proxy Statement is first
mailed to the Company's shareholders and (B) the first Business Day after the
date the Company files with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. Subject to compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement, nothing shall prohibit Parent or Merger Sub from entering
into agreements relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby or the operation of Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
including adding other equity providers or operating partners, it being
understood and agreed for the avoidance of doubt that Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be prohibited from taking any such action that would
be reasonably likely to adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

                 Section 6.16   Subsequent Filings. Until the Effective Time,
the Company will timely file with the SEC each form, report and document
required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act. As of their
respective dates, none of such reports shall contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, unless any such untrue statements or
omissions is cured in a timely manner. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in
such reports shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and shall fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of their
operations, cash flows and changes in financial position for the periods then
ended.

                 Section 6.17   Cooperation in Obtaining Consents. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any third party
consent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to the
extent reasonably determined by the Parties to be required pursuant to the terms
of any Contract listed or required to be listed in Section 4.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or any other Company Material Contract; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company be required to amend any such Contract or
make any payment to any counterparty thereto in connection with obtaining such
consent, unless such amendment or payment is conditioned upon consummation of
the Merger.

                               Closing Conditions

               in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Closing
               Date as if made at and as of the Closing Date (except for those
               representations and warranties which address matters only as of
               an earlier date which shall have been true and correct as of such
               earlier date), disregarding for these purposes any exception in
               such representations and warranties relating to materiality,
               except for such failures to be true and correct which,
               individually or in the aggregate, do not have a material adverse
               effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its
               obligations hereunder or which would prevent or materially
               impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
               Merger.

                    Section 7.3.2   Agreements and Covenants. Parent and Merger
               Sub shall have performed or complied in all material respects
               with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to
               be performed or complied with by Parent and/or Merger Sub on or
               prior to the Closing Date.

                    Section 7.3.3   Officer's Certificate. The Company shall
               have received a certificate of an executive officer of Parent
               confirming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
               Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.

                 Section 7.4   Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth
in Article 7 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Party's failure
to act in good faith to comply with this Agreement and consummate the
transactions provided for herein.

                                   Article 8.
                        Termination, Amendment and Waiver

                 Section 8.1   Termination. This Agreement may be terminated,
and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating Party or Parties, whether before or after the Stockholder Approval:

                    (a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

                    (b) by either Parent or the Company (if, in the case of the
               Company, it has not materially violated Section 6.4):

                         (i) if the Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the
                    Company Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment thereof at
                    which this Agreement has been voted upon;

                         (ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
                    the date that is nine (9) months from the date hereof (the
                    "Termination Date"); provided, however, that if the
                    Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to the date that
                    is nine (9) months from the date hereof, then the
                    Termination Date shall be extended to the earlier of (x) ten
                    (10) months from the date hereof and (y) the end of the
                    Marketing Period (and in such event, the term "Termination
                    Date" shall mean the earlier of such extended date); or

                         (iii) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation
                    of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited (unless the
                    consummation of the Merger in violation of such Law would
                    not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
                    Adverse Effect) or any Order of any Governmental Entity
                    having competent jurisdiction is entered enjoining the
                    Company, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Merger
                    and such Order has become final and nonappealable (unless
                    the consummation of the Merger in violation of such Order
                    would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
                    Adverse Effect) and, prior to termination pursuant to this
                    Section 8.1(b)(iii) each of the Parties shall have used its
                    best efforts to resist, appeal, obtain consent under,
                    resolve or lift, as applicable, the Law or Order and shall
                    have complied in all material respects with its obligations
                    under Section 6.5; provided, however, that the right to
                    terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
                    8.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to any Party whose breach
                    of any provision of this Agreement results in the imposition
                    of any such Order or the failure of such Order to be
                    resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable.

                    (c) by the Company:

                         (i) if (x) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any
                    of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement
                    to be complied with by Parent or Merger Sub such that the
                    closing condition set forth in Section 7.3.2 would not be
                    satisfied, (y) there exists a breach of any representation
                    or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this

                                       51
<PAGE>

                    Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in
                    Section 7.3.1 would not be satisfied or (z) Parent or Merger
                    Sub fails to obtain proceeds pursuant to the Commitments (or
                    any alternative financing) sufficient to consummate the
                    transactions contemplated by this Agreement within three (3)
                    Business Days after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
                    set forth in Article 7 (excluding conditions that, by their
                    terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but which
                    would be reasonably capable of being satisfied at Closing)
                    or such later date as is specified in Section 2.2, and, in
                    the case the breach under (x) or (y) is unintentional, such
                    breach is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date
                    or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days after
                    Parent or Merger Sub receives written notice of such breach
                    from the Company; or

                         (ii) if prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder
                    Approval (w) the Company Board has received a Superior
                    Proposal, (x) the Company Board determines in good faith
                    that such termination is necessary for the members of the
                    Company Board to comply with their fiduciary duties to the
                    holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law, (y)
                    the Company has complied in all material respects with
                    Section 6.4 and (z) not later than the day of such
                    termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent
                    in accordance with Section 8.4.

                    (d) by Parent:

                         (i) (x) if the Company shall have breached any of the
                    covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be
                    complied with by the Company such that the closing condition
                    set forth in Section 7.2.2 would not be satisfied or (y)
                    there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of
                    the Company contained in this Agreement such that the
                    closing condition set forth in Section 7.2.1 would not be
                    satisfied, and, in the case the breach under (x) or (y) is
                    unintentional, such breach is incapable of being cured by
                    the Termination Date or is not cured by the Company within
                    thirty (30) Business Days after the Company receives written
                    notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; or

                         (ii) if, prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder
                    Approval (x) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
                    have occurred, (y) the Company has failed to include the
                    Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (z) the
                    Company Board approves or recommends a Takeover Proposal to
                    the holders of Company Common Stock or approves or
                    recommends that holders of Company Common Stock tender their
                    shares of Company Common Stock in any tender offer or
                    exchange offer that is a Takeover Proposal.

                 Section 8.2   Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Section 8.2, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by
either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers or directors;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.2, Sections 8.3, 8.4,
8.5 and Article 9 and the NDA shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement; provided, further, that, subject to Section
8.5, no Party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of its willful and material breach of any provision of this
Agreement. In no event shall any Party be liable for punitive damages.

                 Section 8.3   Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly
set forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

                 Section 8.4   Termination Fee.

                    Section 8.4.1   If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
               Section 8.1(c)(ii) and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
               material default of this Agreement at the time of such
               termination, then the Company shall pay Parent $135,000,000 (the
               "Termination Fee") not later than the day of such termination. If
               this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or
               Section 8.1(d)(ii) and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
               material default of this Agreement at the time of such
               termination, then, in the event that, (i) after the date hereof
               and prior to such termination, any Third Party shall have
               publicly made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention
               to make a bona fide Takeover Proposal, which bona fide Takeover
               Proposal has not been retracted or rescinded by the time of the
               Company Stockholders' Meeting and (ii) within nine (9) months of
               the termination of this Agreement the Company enters into a
               definitive agreement with such Third Party with respect to a
               Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
               Takeover Proposal increased to fifty (50) percent) or any
               Takeover Proposal is consummated by such Third Party (with all
               percentages in the definition of Takeover Proposal increased to
               fifty (50) percent), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be
               paid to, Parent the Termination Fee immediately upon consummation
               of such Takeover Proposal. The Termination Fee shall be paid by
               wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
               designated in writing to the Company by Parent and shall be the
               sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and/or Merger Sub against the
               Company in circumstance in which the Termination Fee is payable.
               For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
               obligated to pay, or cause to paid, the Termination Fee on more
               than one occasion.

                    Section 8.4.2   The Company acknowledges that the agreements
               contained in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the
               transactions contemplated in this Agreement, that the damages
               resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances
               where a Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable
               of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to
               Section 8.4.1 are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages
               which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a
               penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not
               enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
               promptly pay the Termination Fee and, in order to obtain such
               payments Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
               against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall
               pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable
               attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit.

                 Section 8.5   Business Interruption Fee. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii) and all conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 (other than Section 7.2.3) are then satisfied or
capable of being satisfied, 8.1(c)(i)(x), 8.1(c)(i)(y) as a result of an

                                       53
<PAGE>

intentional breach, or 8.1(c)(i)(z), Parent shall pay the Company a business
interruption fee in an aggregate amount of $175,000,000 (the "Business
Interruption Fee"), which amount shall not be subject to offset or deduction of
any kind and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against
Parent and/or Merger Sub in circumstances in which the Business Interruption Fee
is payable. The Business Interruption Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company in writing to
Parent on the second Business Day following termination of this Agreement by the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to
pay, or cause to paid, the Business Interruption Fee on more than one occasion.
Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
subject to any liability in excess of the amount of the Business Interruption
Fee in respect of (i) any claims for monetary damages that the Company may bring
against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement,
(ii) all other such amounts paid by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company with
respect to all claims that had previously been brought by the Company against
Parent and/or Merger Sub and (iii) any amounts paid by Parent to the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.5. Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay the Business
Interruption Fee and, in order to obtain such payment the company commences a
suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the Business Interruption
Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees) in connection with such suit.

                 Section 8.6   Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
subject to Section 8.7, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after any approval of this
Agreement by the Company's stockholders, there may not be any extension or
waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger Consideration or which
adversely affects the rights of the Company's stockholders hereunder without the
approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

                 Section 8.7   Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after approval
of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment that, by Law
or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by such stockholders may be made without further stockholder approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
Parent and the Company.

                                   Article 9.
                               General Provisions

                 Section 9.1   Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties.
None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective

                                       54
<PAGE>

Time. None of the covenants or agreements of the Parties in this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time, other than (i) the covenants and agreements
contained in this Article 9, the agreements of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company in Article 3 (Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates),
Section 6.8 (Employee Matters), Section 6.9 (Indemnification of Directors and
Officers) and Section 8.3 (Fees and Expenses) and (ii) those other covenants and
agreements contained herein that by their terms apply, or that are to be
performed in whole or in part, after the Effective Time, which shall survive the
consummation of the Merger until fully performed.

                 Section 9.2   Notices. Any notices or other communications
required or permitted under, or otherwise in connection with this Agreement,
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered
in person or upon confirmation of receipt when transmitted by facsimile
transmission or by electronic mail (but only if followed by transmittal by
national overnight courier or hand for delivery on the next Business Day) or on

                 Section 9.3   Headings. The headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

                 Section 9.4   Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest
extent possible.

                 Section 9.5   Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with
the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Schedule, Company Disclosure Schedule and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Commitments and the NDA
constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, are not (other than in the case of Article
3 and Section 6.9) intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF PARENT,

                                       56
<PAGE>

MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND
EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR
ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND
LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR
DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR
OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

                 Section 9.6   Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any
of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such
Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

                 Section 9.7   Mutual Drafting. Each Party has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the Parties.

                 Section 9.8   Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Trial by Jury.

                    Section 9.8.1   This Agreement shall be governed by, and
               construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws
               of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law
               principles that would result in the application of any Laws other
               than the Laws of the State of Delaware.

                    Section 9.8.2   The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
               damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
               Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with
               the terms hereof and that, prior to the termination of this
               Agreement pursuant to Article 8, Parent and Merger Sub shall be
               entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition
               to any other remedy at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
               that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
               injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
               Merger Sub or any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and
               provisions of this Agreement and that the Company's sole and
               exclusive remedies with respect to any such breach shall be the
               remedies set forth in Section 8.5. Any legal action, suit or
               proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
               transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely in the
               Chancery Court of the State of Delaware; provided, that if (and
               only after) such courts determine that they lack subject matter
               jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding, such
               legal action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the Federal
               courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware;
               provided, further, that if (and only after) both the Chancery
               Court of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the
               United States located in the State of Delaware determine that
               they lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal action,
               suit or proceeding, such legal action, suit or proceeding shall
               be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern
               District of New York. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to

                                       57
<PAGE>

               the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal
               action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
               Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
               waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such
               action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
               personally to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the action,
               suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
               venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this
               Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be
               enforced in or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or
               the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising
               out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
               contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
               delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.2.

                 Section 9.9   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile and in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.
