7    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION    THIS AGREEMENT
AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("AGREEMENT") is made and entered into
as of June 7, 2000, by and among: MOLECULAR DEVICES CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation ("PARENT"); MERCURY ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"); and LJL BIOSYSTEMS,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"). Certain capitalized terms used
in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.   RECITALS   A. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company
in accordance with this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "MERGER"). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  
B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "CODE"). For financial reporting purposes, it is intended
that the Merger be accounted for as a "pooling of interests."   C. The
respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved this Agreement and approved the Merger.   D. In order to induce
Parent to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, certain
stockholders of the Company are entering into Voting Agreements pursuant to
which they are agreeing to vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger. In order to induce the Company to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, certain stockholders
of Parent are entering into Voting Agreements pursuant to which they are
agreeing to vote in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger.   AGREEMENT   The parties to this Agreement,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:   SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION
OF TRANSACTION   1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The
Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION").   1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").   1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE
TIME. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP,
located at Five Palo Alto Square, 3000 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, California,
at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be designated by Parent (the "CLOSING DATE"),
which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7. Contemporaneously
with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, the parties hereto
shall cause a properly executed certificate of merger   8   conforming to
the requirements of the DGCL (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall take effect
at the time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be specified in
the Certificate of Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   1.4 CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Unless otherwise determined
by Parent prior to the Effective Time:   (a) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation  shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to substantially  conform to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective
Time;   (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and 
restated as of the Effective Time to substantially conform to the Bylaws  of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and   (c)
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation  immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals  who are directors and
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the  Effective Time.   1.5
CONVERSION OF SHARES.   (a) Subject to the other subsections of this Section
1.5, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:   (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the 
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company\'s 
treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist at the 
Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange 
therefor;   (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, 
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and  retired
and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time, and no  consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor;   (iii) each share of the common stock,
$0.001 par value per  share, of Merger Sub then outstanding shall be
converted into one share  of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;
and   (iv) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this 
sentence, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be 
converted into the right to receive 0.30 of a share of Parent Common  Stock
(the "EXCHANGE RATIO").   (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall
be appropriately adjusted.   (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition   
2.  9  under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any rights, then
the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends. The Surviving Corporation shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.  
(d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to
such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender
of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6) be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing sales price
of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
on the second day preceding the Closing Date.   1.6 CLOSING OF THE
COMPANY\'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all
holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on
such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company
Common Stock (a "COMPANY STOCK CERTIFICATE") is presented to the Exchange
Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.7.   1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) EquiServe,
L.P. or such other reputable bank or trust company selected by Parent prior
to the Closing Date shall act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii) cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.5(e). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are
referred to collectively as the "EXCHANGE FUND."   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail
to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender
of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together
with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1)    3.  10  the
holder of such Company Stock Certificate that does not perfect
its dissenters\' rights, if any, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock), and (2) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued
to a transferee if the Company Stock Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by
Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.   (c) No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive upon surrender thereof until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7
(at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and
distributions, without interest).   (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the
date 360 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (e) Each of the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.   (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts,
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.   1.8
RESERVED.    4.  11   1.9 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the
Company that, as of the Effective Time, are or may become "dissenting shares"
within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the California General Corporation
Law, if applicable, shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 (or cash in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d)), and the holder or
holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such holder or holders in the California General Corporation Law;
provided, however, that if the status of any such shares as "dissenting
shares" shall not be perfected, or if any such shares shall lose their status
as "dissenting shares," then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such
shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the
right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares) Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 1.5(d)).   1.10 RESERVED.   1.11 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal
income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement
hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.   1.12 ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES. For financial reporting
purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as a "pooling of
interests."   1.13 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.   SECTION 2.

warrants to and for the benefit of Parent and Merger as follows:   2.1 DUE

which it may become obligated, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any

Disclosure Schedule.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 2.3(b), as of June
6, 2000, there was no: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call, warrant or

all Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable the Acquired Corporations
to conduct their respective businesses in the manner in which such businesses
are currently being conducted, except where the failure to hold such
Governmental Authorizations has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. Each Acquired
Corporation is, and at all times since June 30, 1999 has been, in substantial
compliance with the terms and requirements of such Governmental
Authorizations, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms
and requirements of such Governmental Authorizations has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations. Since June 30, 1999, none of the Acquired Corporations has
received any notice or other communication from any Governmental Body
regarding (a) any actual or possible violation of or failure to comply with
any term or requirement of any material Governmental Authorization, or (b)
any actual or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination or modification of any material Governmental Authorization.  
2.16 TAX MATTERS.   (a) Each material Tax Return required to be filed by or

(b) The Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet fully accrues all actual and
contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through
March 31, 2000 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
other than amounts which in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse
Effect if determined to be due. Each Acquired Corporation will establish, in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with its past practices,
reserves adequate for the payment of all Taxes for the period from Unaudited
Interim Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, and will disclose the
amount of such reserves to Parent no later than 10 business days prior to the
Closing Date. Since December 31, 1998, none of the Acquired Corporations has
incurred any liability for any Tax other than in the ordinary course of its
business.   (c) No Acquired Corporation Return has been examined or
audited by any Governmental Body. No extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any of the Acquired Corporation Returns has been granted
(by any Acquired Corporation or any other Person) that has not expired, and
no such extension or waiver has been requested from any Acquired Corporation,
other than extensions or waivers that are no longer in effect.    16. 
23   (d) No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, has been threatened against or with respect to any
Acquired Corporation in respect of any material Tax. There are no unsatisfied
liabilities for material Taxes (including liabilities for interest, additions
to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with respect to any notice
of deficiency or similar document received by any Acquired Corporation with
respect to any material Tax (other than liabilities for Taxes asserted under
any such notice of deficiency or similar document which are being contested
in good faith by the Acquired Corporations and with respect to which adequate
reserves for payment have been established on the Unaudited Interim Balance
Sheet). There are no liens for material Taxes upon any of the assets of any
of the Acquired Corporations except liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable. None of the Acquired Corporations has entered into or become bound
by any agreement or consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code (or any
comparable provision of state or foreign Tax laws). None of the Acquired
Corporations has been, and none of the Acquired Corporations will be,
required to include any adjustment in taxable income for any tax period (or
portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481 or 263A of the Code (or any
comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws) as a result of
transactions or events occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to
the Closing.   (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.16(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or
other Contract covering any employee or independent contractor or former
employee or independent contractor of any of the Acquired Corporations that,
considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
Contracts, will, or could reasonably be expected to, give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision
under state or foreign Tax laws). None of the Acquired Corporations is, or
has ever been, a party to or bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax
sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract. The Company

for the benefit of any current or former employee or director of any of the
Acquired Corporations (a "PENSION PLAN").    17.  24   (c) Except as
set forth in Part 2.17(a) or Part 2.17(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

None of the Acquired Corporations is or has ever been required to be treated
as a single employer with any other Person under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA
or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. None of the Acquired
Corporations has ever been a member of an "affiliated service group" within
the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code. None of the Acquired Corporations
has ever made a complete or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal
liability," as such term is defined in Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard
to any subsequent reduction or waiver of such liability under either Section
4207 or 4208 of ERISA).   (f) None of the Acquired Corporations has any plan
or commitment to create any Plan or to modify or change any existing Plan
(other than to comply with applicable law) in a manner that would affect any
current or former employee or director of any of the Acquired
Corporations.   (g) No Plan provides death, medical or health benefits
(whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former employee or
director of any of the Acquired Corporations after termination of service of
such employee or director (other than (i) benefit coverage mandated by
applicable law, including coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code, (ii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet, and (iii) benefits the full cost of which
are borne by current or former employees or directors of any of the Acquired

the Code, to the Knowledge of the Company, the provisions of Section 4980B of
the Code ("COBRA") have been complied with in all material respects.   (i)
To the Knowledge of the Company, each of the Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable Legal

Legal Requirement pursuant to which any of the Acquired    18. 
25  Corporations is required to establish any reserve or make any
contribution for the benefit of any current or former employee located in the
United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany or any other foreign
jurisdiction.   (j) Each of the Plans intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service or the deadline for applying to the Internal
Revenue Service for such a determination letter has yet to expire, and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter could be
revoked or should not be issued.   (k) Except pursuant to the Change of
Control Agreements or as set forth in Part 2.17(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement,
nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute,
severance or other payment or obligation to any current or former employee or
director of any of the Acquired Corporations (whether or not under any Plan),
materially increase the benefits payable or provided under any Plan, or
result in any acceleration of the time of payment, provision or vesting of
any such benefits. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and
except pursuant to the Change of Control Agreements or as set forth in Part
2.17(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the consummation of the Merger
will not result in the acceleration of vesting of any unvested Company
Options.   (l) Part 2.17(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each employee of each of the Acquired Corporations as of the date
of this Agreement, and correctly reflects, in all material respects, the
current salary and any other compensation payable to such employee (including
compensation payable pursuant to bonus, deferred compensation or commission
arrangements), such employee\'s employer, years employed and position. None

and Contracts relating to employment, employment practices, wages, bonuses
and terms and conditions of employment, including employee

that (i) the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will have a material adverse effect on the
labor relations of any of the Acquired Corporations, or (ii) any of the
employees of any of the Acquired Corporations intends to terminate his or her

thereof. To the Knowledge of the Company, since June 30, 1999, none of the
Acquired Corporations has received any notice or other communication (in

Materials of Environmental Concern or protection of the environment
(including ambient air, surface water, ground water, land surface or

order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree that prohibits such officer or
other key employee from engaging in or continuing any conduct, activity or
practice relating to the business of any of the Acquired Corporations.  
2.22 AUTHORITY; INAPPLICABILITY OF ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES; BINDING NATURE OF

authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement. The board of directors of the Company (at a meeting duly called

Corporations has taken or agreed to take, or plans to take, any action that
could prevent Parent from accounting for the Merger as a "pooling of
interests" in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and all published rules,
regulations and policies of the SEC. The Company has received oral advice

qualifications contained in such oral advice) that the Company is a "poolable
entity" in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,

Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations was, is or
will be required to make any filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain
any Consent from, any Person in connection with (x) the execution, delivery

of this Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of
the Company; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would
make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6
or Section 7 impossible or unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent in writing of any Legal Proceeding or material claim
threatened, commenced or asserted against or with respect to any of
the Acquired Corporations. No notification given to Parent pursuant to this
Section 4.2(c) shall limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations of the Company contained in this
Agreement.   (d) If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that
is required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 4.2(c) requires any change in
the Disclosure Schedule, or if any such event, condition, fact or
circumstance would require such a change assuming the Disclosure Schedule
were dated as of the date of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such
event, condition, fact or circumstance, then the Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent an update to the Disclosure Schedule specifying such
change. No such update shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedule for the purpose of (i) determining the accuracy of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company or any of the Designated
Shareholders in this Agreement, or (ii) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6 has been satisfied.   4.3 NO
SOLICITATION.   (a) The Company shall not directly or indirectly, and shall
not authorize or permit any of the other Acquired Corporations or any
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations directly or indirectly to,
(i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any action that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any
information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in
connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction; provided,
however, that prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company shall not be prohibited by
this Section 4.3(a) from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the
Acquired Corporations to, or entering into discussions with, any Person in
response to a Superior Offer that is submitted by such Person (and not
withdrawn) if (1) neither the Company nor any Representative of any of the
Acquired Corporations shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 4.3, (2) the board of directors of the Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of such board of directors to the Company\'s stockholders under
applicable law, (3) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and of the Company\'s intention to
furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such
Person, and the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all
nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company, and (4) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information
to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously
furnished by the    34.  41  Company to Parent); and provided, further,
that nothing herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from
taking, and disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders, a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
parties agree that for purposes of the preceding sentence (but for no other
purpose), an offer which is conditioned on completion of due diligence and
other customary conditions (and regarding which the board of directors of the
Company determines, in good faith, based on the advice of its financial
advisor, that financing is likely to be obtained) shall be deemed
to constitute a "Superior Offer" if such offer otherwise meets the definition
of "Superior Offer" set forth in Exhibit A (other than the financing portion
of such definition). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of any of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of any of the
Acquired Corporations, whether or not such Representative is purporting to
act on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations, shall be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent in writing of any material inquiry, proposal or offer
relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction that is received by the
Company during the Pre-Closing Period.   (b) The Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal (including
the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal and
the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-
Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed with respect to
the status of any such Acquisition Proposal and any modification or proposed
modification thereto.   4.4 OPERATION OF PARENT\'S BUSINESS.   (a) During
the Pre-Closing Period: (i) Parent shall ensure that it conducts its business
and operations (A) in the ordinary course and in accordance with past
practices and (B) in substantial compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements and the material requirements of all material contracts; and
(ii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that it
preserves intact its current business organization, keeps available
the services of its current officers and other employees and maintains its
relations and goodwill with all suppliers, customers, landlords, creditors,
licensors, licensees, employees and other Persons having business
relationships with Parent. By way of amplification and without limitation,
neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries shall, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, directly or indirectly do, or propose to do, any of the
following without the prior written consent of Company:   (i) amend or
otherwise change the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational document of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or alter through
merger, liquidation, reorganization, restructuring or in any other fashion
the corporate structure of Parent;   (ii) amend the terms of, repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire, or permit any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire, any of its securities or any securities of its
Subsidiaries; or propose to do any of the foregoing;   (iii) (x) acquire or
agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing any
equity interest in or a portion of the assets of, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or (y) otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire any assets which are material, individually or in the aggregate, to
the business of Parent or enter into any joint ventures, strategic
partnerships or alliances, in the case of both (x) and (y), where
such acquisition or agreement is reasonably likely to materially delay
consummation of the Merger or materially adversely affect Parent\'s ability
to consummate the Merger;    35.  42   (iv) adopt a plan of complete or
partial liquidation or dissolution of Parent;   (v) fail to make in a
timely manner any material filings with the SEC required under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder;
or   (vi) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions
described in Section 4.4(a)(i) through (v) above.   (b) During the Pre-
Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of: (i)
the discovery by Parent of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that
occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused
or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made
by Parent in this Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance
that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would
cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by Parent in this Agreement if (A) such representation or warranty had
been made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such
event, condition, fact or circumstance, or (B) such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent;
and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would make the
timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 or
Section 7 impossible or unlikely or that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall promptly advise the Company in
writing of any Legal Proceeding or material claim overtly threatened,
commenced or asserted against or with respect to Parent. No notification
given to the Company pursuant to this Section 4.4(b) shall limit or otherwise
affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of
Parent contained in this Agreement.   SECTION 5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE
PARTIES   5.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; JOINT PROSPECTUS/PROXY STATEMENT.  
(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Form S-4 Registration Statement, in which the
Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement to
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to have the Form S-4
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC. The Company and
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent and the Company shall promptly
furnish to the other information concerning Parent or the Company or their
respective stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 5.1. If any event
relating to any of the Acquired Corporations or Parent occurs, or if either
party becomes aware of any information that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the
Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement, then such party shall promptly inform the
other party thereof and shall cooperate in filing such amendment or
supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company or Parent.    36.  43  
(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified under
the securities law of every jurisdiction of the United States in which
any registered holder of Company Common Stock has an address of record on the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to
vote at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; provided, however, that Parent
shall not be required (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation
in any jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or (ii) to file a
general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.   5.2 COMPANY
STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING.   (a) The Company shall take all action necessary
under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the holders of their Common Stock to consider, act upon and
vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING"). The Company Stockholders\'
Meeting will be held as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholder\'s Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided
to the Company\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger Agreement
and the Merger or, if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. The Company
and Parent shall cooperate in attempting to cause the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting to be scheduled and convened on the same date as the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in Section 5.3 below) shall be scheduled
and convened. The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with such Company Stockholders\'
Meeting are solicited, in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.
The Company\'s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold its
respective Stockholders\' Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a)
shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition
Proposal, or by any withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
recommendation of the board of directors of either Company with respect to
the Merger.   (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the board of directors of
the Company shall unanimously recommend that the Company\'s stockholders vote
in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; (ii) the Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement
shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the
Company has unanimously recommended that the Company\'s stockholders vote in
favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting; and (iii) neither the board of directors of
the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this
Agreement and approve the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, said
recommendation of the board of directors of the Company shall be deemed to
have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent if said recommendation shall
no longer be unanimous.   (c) Nothing in Section 5.2(b) shall prevent the
board of directors of the Company from withdrawing, amending or modifying its
unanimous recommendation in favor of the Merger at any time prior to the
adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder
Vote if (i) a Superior Offer is made to the Company and is not withdrawn,
(ii) neither the    37.  44  Company nor any of its Representatives
shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 4.3, (iii)
the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer,
it would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the board of
directors of the Company to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law
not to withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation, (iv) the Company
provides Parent with at least 24 hours prior notice of any meeting of the
Company\'s board of directors at which such board of directors is expected to
consider such Superior Offer, and (v) the Company\'s board of directors does
not withdraw, amend or modify its unanimous recommendation in favor of the
Merger for at least 48 hours after the Company provides Parent with the name
of the Person making such Superior Offer and a copy of such Superior Offer.
Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall limit the Company\'s obligation
to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting
(regardless of whether the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors
of the Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).   5.3
PARENT STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING.   (a) Parent shall take all action necessary
to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the holders of Parent
Common Stock to consider and vote upon the issuance of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger and, to the extent required under Parent\'s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and applicable law, the election of Lev J. Leytes to
Parent\'s Board of Directors (the "PARENT STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING"). The
Parent Stockholders\' Meeting will be held as promptly as practicable after
the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided
to Parent\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger or, if as of the time for which the
Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of Parent
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent\'s Stockholders\'
Meeting. Parent shall ensure that the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is
called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited
in connection with such Parent Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited, in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.   (b) (i) The board of
directors of Parent shall unanimously recommend that Parent\'s stockholders
vote in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the
election of Lev J. Leytes to Parent\'s Board of Directors at the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting; (ii) the Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement shall
include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of Parent has
unanimously recommended that Parent\'s stockholders vote in favor of the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the election of
Lev. J. Leytes to Parent\'s Board of Directors at Parent\'s Stockholders\'
Meeting; and (iii) neither the board of directors of Parent nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse the Company, the unanimous
recommendation of the board of directors of Parent that
Parent\'s stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger and the election of Lev J. Leytes to Parent\'s Board of
Directors. For purposes of this Agreement, said recommendation of the board
of directors of Parent shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner
adverse to the Company if said recommendation shall no longer be
unanimous.   5.4 REGULATORY APPROVALS. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to
be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit
promptly any additional information    38.  45  requested by any such
Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare
and file the notifications required under the HSR Act, if any, in connection
with the Merger. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as
practicable to (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any
state attorney general or other Governmental Body in connection with
antitrust or related matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (1) give
the other party prompt notice of the commencement of any Legal Proceeding by
or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding, and (3) promptly
inform the other party of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Body
regarding the Merger. The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with
one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal
Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal or state
antitrust or fair trade law. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any Legal
Proceeding under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal or state
antitrust or fair trade law or any other similar Legal Proceeding, each of
the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the other
party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any
document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in
connection with any such Legal Proceeding.   5.5 STOCK OPTIONS AND
WARRANTS.   (a) Subject to Section 5.5(b), at the Effective Time, all
rights with respect to Company Common Stock under each Company Option then
outstanding shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent
Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Option in accordance
with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the stock
option plan under which it was issued, the stock option agreement by which it
is evidenced and any applicable Change of Control Agreement. At the Effective
Time, all rights with respect to Company Common Stock under each Company
Warrant then outstanding shall be converted into and become rights to Parent
Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each such Company Warrant in accordance
with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company
Warrant and any warrant agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after
the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option and Company Warrant assumed by
Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Company Option
and Company Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option and Company Warrant immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the
nearest whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such
Company Option and Company Warrant shall be adjusted by dividing the per
share exercise price under such Company Option and Company Warrant by the
Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent and (iv) any restriction
on the exercise of any such Company Option and Company Warrant shall continue
in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and
other provisions of such Company Option and Company Warrant shall otherwise
remain unchanged; provided, however, that each Company Option and Company
Warrant assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.5(a) shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to
the Effective Time. It is the intention of the parties that the Company
Options assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as incentive
stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such
Company Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the    39. 
46  Effective Time. Parent shall file with the SEC, within 7 days after the
date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form
S-8 relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
the Company Options assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus contained in such registration statement) for so long as
the Company Options remain outstanding. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than 30 days thereafter), Parent shall
deliver to each holder of a Company Option or Company Warrant an appropriate
notice setting forth such holder\'s rights with respect to such Company
Option or Company Warrant and indicating that such Company Option or Company
Warrant shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as were in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments
required pursuant to Section 5.5(a)).   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 5.5, in lieu of assuming outstanding
Company Options in accordance with Section 5.5(a), Parent may, at its
election, cause such outstanding Company Options to be replaced by issuing
reasonably equivalent replacement stock options in substitution therefor
("REPLACEMENT OPTIONS"). The vesting schedule of any Replacement Option shall
be the same as that of the option being replaced. The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to a Replacement Option, as well as the per share
exercise price of such Replacement Option, shall be determined in the manner
specified in Section 5.5(a). If Parent elects to substitute Replacement
Options in lieu of assuming outstanding Company Options, Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to approve the Replacement Options described
in this Section 5.5(b) in a manner qualifying under Section 424(a) of the
Code and to grant options that qualify as incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Code (to the extent such Company Options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time) and shall deliver an
agreement evidencing such Replacement Options to each applicable holder of a
Company Option within 30 days after the Effective Time. Shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Replacement Options granted pursuant to
this Section 5.5(b) shall be registered on the Form S-8
Registration Statement referred to in Section 5.5(a). Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
contained in such registration statement) for so long as the Replacement
Options remain outstanding.   (c) The Company shall take all action that
may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.5
and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company
Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically
provided in this Section 5.5. The parties intend that the assumption or
replacement of Company options provided for under this Section 5.5 shall
comply with the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code, and this Section
5.5 shall be interpreted consistent with such intent.   (d) As of the
Effective Time, the ESPP shall be terminated. The rights of participants in
the ESPP with respect to any offering period then underway under the ESPP
shall be determined by treating the last business day prior to the Effective
Time as the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-
rata adjustments as may be required pursuant to the ESPP to reflect the
reduced offering period but otherwise treating such offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes of such Plan.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 5.5(d); provided, however, that the change in the offering period
referred to in this Section 5.5(d) shall be conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger.   5.6 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Parent agrees that all employees of
the Company who continue employment with Parent or the Company after the
Effective Time shall be eligible to participate in    40. 
47  Parent\'s health, vacation and other employee benefit plans, to the same
extent as employees of Parent in similar positions and at similar grade
levels (it being understood that such employees shall be eligible to begin to
participate (i) in Parent\'s employee stock purchase plan upon the
commencement of the first new offering period that commences following the
Effective Time, and (ii) in Parent\'s other employee benefit plans in
accordance with the terms of such plans; provided, however, that in the case
of plans for which the Company maintains a plan offering the same type of
benefit, such eligibility need not be offered by Parent until the
corresponding plan of the Company ceases to be available after the Effective
Time). As soon as administratively feasible following the Effective Time,
Parent agrees to take whatever action is necessary to transition Company
employees into Parent\'s employee benefits plans as contemplated by the first
sentence of this Section 5.6. Further, until such time that the continuing
Company employees are covered under an employee benefit plan of Parent, they
shall continue to be covered under the corresponding Company Plan that offers
the same type of benefit. Parent also agrees to provide each such continuing
employee with full credit for service as an employee of the Company or any
affiliate thereof prior to the Effective Time for the following purposes
only: for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of
benefits (without duplication) under any employee benefit plan or arrangement
maintained by Parent, including Parent\'s 401(k) plan, and for Parent\'s
vacation program. To the extent practicable and only if permitted by the
relevant insurance carrier, Parent shall administer its medical plan ("PARENT
MEDICAL PLAN") so as to coordinate deductibles, "out-of-pocket" maximums and
maximum benefit restrictions so that: (A) Company employees receive credit
under the Parent Medical Plan toward any deductibles under the Parent Medical
Plan for deductibles paid under any of the medical, dental and prescription
drug plans included within the Company Plans ("Company Medical Plan") on or
prior to the Effective Time which, had the Company employees been covered by
the Parent Medical Plan, would have been taken into account by the Parent
Medical Plan, (B) Company employees receive credit for their eligible out-of-
pocket costs with respect to eligible claims incurred under the
Company Medical Plan which, had the Company employees been covered by the
Parent Medical Plan, would have been taken into account under the Parent
Medical Plan toward any "out-of-pocket" maximums under the Parent Medical
Plan, and (C) Company employees are credited with benefits received under the
Company Medical Plan on or prior to the Effective Time which, had the Company
employees been covered by the Parent Medical Plan, would have been taken into
account by the Parent Medical Plan for purposes of applying the maximum
benefit restrictions under the Parent Medical Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by law, Parent reserves the right to
enforce, on a nondiscriminatory basis, any otherwise applicable pre-existing
condition limitation under its medical plan with respect to any Company
employee who does not enroll in Parent\'s medical plan at the time Parent\'s
medical plan is first made available to such Company employee.   5.7
INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (a) All rights to
indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who are directors and
officers of the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the "INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS") for acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as
provided in the Company\'s Bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between the
Company and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement), shall survive the Merger and shall be observed by the
Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent available under Delaware law for
a period of five years from the Effective Time.   (b) From the Effective
Time until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified
Persons with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, the existing policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement (the "EXISTING
POLICY"); provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies of
comparable coverage, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual    41.  48  premium for the Existing Policy (or for
any substitute policies) in excess of $75,000. In the event any future annual
premium for the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) exceeds $75,000,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage
of the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage
that can be obtained for a premium equal to $75,000.   (c) If the Surviving
Corporation does not have sufficient capital to comply with its obligations
under Section 5.6, Parent shall provide the Surviving Corporation with such
capital.   (d) This Section shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, is intended to benefit the indemnified parties, shall be binding upon
all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent and shall
be enforceable by the indemnified parties.   5.8 POOLING OF INTERESTS. Each
of the Company and Parent agrees (and the Company agrees to cause the
Acquired Corporations) (a) not knowingly to take any action during the Pre-
Closing Period that would adversely affect the ability of Parent to account
for the Merger as a "pooling of interests," and (b) to use commercially
reasonable efforts to attempt to ensure that none of its "affiliates" (as
that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act) takes any action that
could adversely affect the ability of Parent to account for the Merger as a
"pooling of interests." The Company and Parent each agrees to provide to
