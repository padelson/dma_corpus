the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto, and in any event on
the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent

Certificate of Merger) is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

2.4 General Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger will be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and

to the Effective Time, at the Effective Time the certificate of incorporation
of the Company, as amended and in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation as
stated in such certificate of incorporation as so amended and restated will be
"Misfit, Inc.," whereupon such certificate of incorporation as so amended and

until subsequently amended in accordance with the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation. (b) Bylaws. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
at the Effective Time the bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately

2.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) Directors. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective

their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

(b) Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, at the Effective Time the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

2.7 Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock:

(a) Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock
of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be converted into and become, and will thereupon represent, one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the
same rights, powers and privileges as each share so converted, and will
thereupon constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares will continue to evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Company Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 2.7, each share of Company Capital Stock that is
outstanding and owned by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time ("Company Treasury Stock") will cease to be outstanding, will be
cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and will
thereupon cease to exist.

(c) Dissenting Shares of Company Capital Stock. Following the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.7, Dissenting
Shares will be treated in accordance with the terms of Section 2.8. (d) Company Capital Stock.

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Treasury Stock and Dissenting Shares), will be cancelled and extinguished and
will be converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such share of Company Capital Stock, that portion
of the Total Consideration, without interest, as set forth below:

(A) each outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock that has not been
converted to Company Common Stock (or deemed to have been converted) pursuant
to the terms of the Charter Documents at or prior to the Effective Time will
be converted automatically into the right to receive the Applicable Series
Preferred Preference Per Share; provided, however, that if the Total
Consideration available for distribution to the holders of the then
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock is insufficient to permit the
full payment to such holders of the Applicable Series Preferred Preference Per
Share, then the Total Consideration will be distributed with equal priority
and pro rata among the holders of the shares of Company Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full amounts they would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.7(d)(i)(A);

(B) each outstanding share of Company Common Stock other than Unvested Company
Shares will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Per Share
Amount; and

(C) each Unvested Company Share will be converted automatically into the right
to receive an amount equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Unvested Share
Consideration"), provided, however, that the Unvested Share Consideration will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the Plan and the agreements evidencing the corresponding Unvested Company
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with
respect to vesting and acceleration. Payments of Unvested Share Consideration
will be made in connection with the next regularly scheduled payroll after the
last business day of Parent's fiscal quarter in which the Unvested Company
Shares to which the Unvested Share Consideration is attributable would have
vested. If a holder of an Unvested Company Share fails to vest in any portion
of his or her Unvested Share Consideration (including due to a failure to meet
the applicable vesting requirements set forth in his or her agreement
evidencing the grant of such Unvested Company Shares), then such amounts shall
revert to the Management Incentive Plan in accordance with the Management
Incentive Plan. Each payment of Unvested Share Consideration hereunder is
intended to be a "separate payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code
and comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any
ambiguities hereunder will be resolved in a manner to maintain such exemption
from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code. From time to time, Parent
will institute appropriate procedures for the payment of Unvested Share
Consideration including with respect to appropriate Tax withholding.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pro Rata Portion of the consideration
payable to each Company Stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.7(d) with
respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock owned by such Company
Stockholder as of the Effective Time will be withheld and placed in escrow
pursuant to the escrow provisions of Article VIII. (e) Treatment of Company Options.

(i) At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount, less applicable withholdings, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock covered by such Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the excess of the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise
price under such Vested Company Option ("Vested Option Consideration").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pro Rata Portion of the Vested Option
Consideration payable to each holder of a Vested Option pursuant to this
Section 2.7(e) will be withheld and placed in escrow pursuant to the escrow
provisions of Article VIII.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option shall be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the excess of the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise
price under such Unvested Company Option ("Unvested Option Consideration").
The Unvested Option Consideration will be subject to applicable withholdings
and continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in the Plan and the agreements evidencing the corresponding Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions
with respect to vesting and acceleration, provided that payments of Unvested
Option Consideration will be made in connection with the next regularly
scheduled payroll after the last business day of Parent's fiscal quarter in
which the Unvested Company Options to which the Unvested Option Consideration
is attributable would have vested. If a holder of an Unvested Company Option
fails to vest in any portion of his or her Unvested Option Consideration
(including, due to a failure to meet the applicable vesting requirements set
forth in his or her agreement evidencing the grant of such Unvested Company
Option), then such amounts shall revert to the Management Incentive Plan in
accordance with the Management Incentive Plan and be forfeited by such holder
for no consideration. Each payment of Unvested Option Consideration hereunder
is intended to be a "separate payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the
Code and comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any
ambiguities hereunder will be resolved in a manner to maintain such exemption
from or compliance with Section 409A of the Code. From time to time, Parent
will institute appropriate procedures for the payment of Unvested Option
Consideration including with respect to appropriate Tax withholding.

(f) Treatment of Company Warrants. Each Company Warrant shall be cancelled,
terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the
cancellation thereof be converted into the right to receive, in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock deemed to be represented by such Company
Warrant, an amount in cash equal to (i) the Per Share Amount less (ii) the
applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock deemed to be
represented by such Company Warrant. Each holder of an outstanding Company
Warrant cancelled as provided in this Section 2.7(f) shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash
consideration specified in this Section 2.7(f) without interest. (g) Withholding of Taxes. The Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Escrow Agent, at the written request of the Company, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any Total
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law and be provided with any necessary
Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar information. The Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate
any such withholding, provided, that such obligation shall be deemed to have
been met if Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent or the Paying
Agent requested the applicable payee to deliver the applicable tax form (such
as Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8). To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts will be treated for all purposes as having
been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
To the extent that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by
such deductions or withholdings, such recipient will indemnify Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent and its
Affiliates for any amounts imposed by any taxing authority together with any
costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs of investigation).

2.8 Dissenting Shares.

(a) No Conversion. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Company
Stockholder who has duly perfected dissenters' rights under applicable Law
(any such shares, the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable Total Consideration for such
Company Stockholder's shares of Company Capital Stock set forth in Section
2.7, but in lieu thereof, such Company Stockholder will be entitled to such
rights as are provided by applicable Law.

(b) Loss of Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
2.8(a), if any holder of Dissenting Shares will effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's dissenters' rights
under applicable Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holder's shares will automatically be converted
into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in accordance with the terms of Section
2.10, the applicable portion of the Total Consideration.

(c) Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, the Company will give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any demand for dissenters' rights or other payment received by the
Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of applicable Law; and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
make any payment with respect to any such demands, or make a binding offer to
settle or settle any such demands. Following the Closing, Parent will consult
with the Securityholder Representative regarding any payments in respect of
any Dissenting Shares in excess of the value of the Total Consideration that
otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to
the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company (i) makes any
payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the value of the Total Consideration that
otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with
this Agreement; or (ii) incurs any Losses (including attorneys' and
consultants' fees and out-of-pocket costs and expenses and including any such
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any action or proceeding) in respect of any Dissenting
Shares (excluding payments for such shares) ((i) and (ii) together,
"Dissenting Share Payments"), then Parent will be entitled to recover, under
the terms of Article VIII, the amount of such Dissenting Share Payments.

2.9 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Calculation of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital. At least five
Business Days prior to 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the Closing Date, the
Company must prepare and deliver to Parent a draft of a statement setting
forth the Company's estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital that is
consistent with the example and methodology set forth on Schedule 1.1(k)
(provided that Schedule 1.1(k) will exclude allowance for returns or defective
product). At least one Business Day prior to 5:00 p.m., Pacific time, on the
Closing Date, the Company must prepare and deliver to Parent a final statement
setting forth the Company's estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Statement"). The Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital Statement must fairly and accurately present the Company's
good faith best estimate (based on reasonable assumptions) of the Closing Net
Working Capital without giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The estimated Closing
Net Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
Statement is referred to herein as the "Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital."

(b) Calculation of Actual Closing Net Working Capital.

(iii) Within 90 days following the Closing Date, except with the written
consent of the Securityholder Representative, Parent must prepare (or cause to
be prepared) and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a statement
setting forth Parent's good faith calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital that is consistent with the example and methodology set forth on
Schedule 1.1(k) (the "Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement").

(iv) The Securityholder Representative may dispute any item or amount set
forth in the Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement within 30 days
following receipt of the Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Parent a written notice of such dispute (a "Notice of Dispute")
setting forth, in reasonable detail and to the extent practicable, (A) each
item or amount so disputed by the Securityholder Representative; (B) the
Securityholder Representative's calculation of each such disputed item or
amount (if possible); and (C) the Securityholder Representative's calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital of the Company after giving effect to the
Securityholder Representative's calculation of each such disputed item or
amount.

(v) If Parent does not receive a Notice of Dispute from the Securityholder
Representative delivered pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.9(b)(ii)
within the time period set forth therein, then (A) the Securityholder
Representative will be deemed to have irrevocably consented and agreed to each item and amount set forth in the Parent's Closing
Net Working Capital Statement delivered by Parent pursuant to Section
2.9(b)(i); and (B) for all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term
"Actual Closing Net Working Capital" will mean the Closing Net Working Capital
as set forth in the Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement delivered
by Parent pursuant to Section 2.9(b)(i). If Parent receives a Notice of
Dispute from the Securityholder Representative delivered pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 2.9(b)(ii) within the time period set forth therein,
then Parent and the Securityholder Representative will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve all disputed items and amounts set forth in
the Notice of Dispute pursuant to good faith negotiations. In the event that
Parent and the Securityholder Representative reach agreement within 30 days
following Parent's receipt of a Notice of Dispute on all disputed items and
amounts set forth in such Notice of Dispute, then for all purposes of and
under this Agreement, the term "Actual Closing Net Working Capital" will mean
the Closing Net Working Capital as agreed upon by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative in writing, and any such resolution will be
final and binding on the parties hereto for the purposes of this Section
2.9(b) and Article VIII. In the event that Parent and the Securityholder
Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days following Parent's
receipt of a Notice of Dispute on all of the disputed items or amounts set
forth in a Notice of Dispute, then the following will occur:

(A) Parent and the Securityholder Representative will execute a memorandum
(the "Working Capital Memorandum") setting forth (1) the resolved items or
amounts, if any; and (2) the items or amounts that remain in dispute following
such good faith negotiations.

(B) At the request of either Parent or the Securityholder Representative,
Parent and the Securityholder Representative must submit all remaining
disputed items and amounts set forth in the Working Capital Memorandum to KPMG
LLP or, if such firm refuses such assignment, to a nationally recognized
accounting firm that has not performed work for, and is otherwise independent
of, each of Parent, the Company and the Securityholder Representative and that
is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Representative (the
"Independent Accounting Firm") for resolution in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof. Each of the parties hereto will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, provide full cooperation to the
Independent Accounting Firm, including providing the Independent Accounting
Firm with all relevant information, books and records and any work papers
relating to the disputed items and amounts and all other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
must (1) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an arbitrator; (2)
consider only those items and amounts identified in the Working Capital
Memorandum as being in dispute between Parent and the Securityholder
Representative; (3) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such
dispute within 30 days after its appointment and provide a written explanation
of its decision; and (4) not (a) determine any liability claimed by the
Securityholder Representative or asset claimed by Parent in an amount less
than that claimed by such party; or (b) determine any asset claimed by the
Securityholder Representative or liability claimed by Parent in an amount in
excess of the amount claimed by such party except, in the case of each of (a)
and (b), as may be necessary to make a corresponding adjustment to a disputed
item in accordance with GAAP. All expenses relating to the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm will be borne by (x) Parent in the proportion that the aggregate dollar value of the
disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are
unsuccessfully disputed by Parent bears to the aggregate value of all such
items so disputed and (y) by the Indemnifying Parties (by using the Escrow
Fund) in the proportion that the aggregate dollar value of the disputed items
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed
by the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties)
bears to the aggregate value of all such items so submitted.. The Independent
Accounting Firm will determine all disputed items and amounts and its decision
in respect thereof will be final and binding upon Parent and the
Securityholder Representative.

(vi) During the period of time from and after the date of the delivery of the
Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement to the Securityholder
Representative until the Actual Closing Net Working Capital has been finally
determined, Parent will provide the Securityholder Representative and its
representatives (including accountants and counsel) (subject to the execution
and delivery of a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent) with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and the working papers used
by Parent (or accountants and counsel retained by it), and access to such
personnel or representatives of Parent and the Surviving Corporation as the
Securityholder Representative may reasonably require for the purposes of
review of, resolving any dispute related to or responding to any matters or
inquiries concerning Parent's calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital,
the Parent's Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the preparation of any
Notice of Dispute. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to respond to
inquiries from the Securityholder Representative regarding the Actual Closing
Net Working Capital Statement.

(vii) After the amount of the Actual Closing Net Working Capital has been
determined, an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital and the Actual Closing Net Working Capital will be
paid as follows: (i) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is greater
than the Actual Closing Net Working Capital, then the Indemnifying Parties on
a several basis based on their Pro Rata Portion will cause to be paid to
Parent an amount equal to such excess by directing the Escrow Agent to
disperse such excess from the Escrow Fund of such amount (such payment, the
"Excess Payment"); and (ii) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is
less than the Actual Closing Net Working Capital, then Parent will pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent, for distribution to the Indemnifying
Parties in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, an amount equal to the
absolute value of such deficiency (such payment, the "Deficiency Payment").
Any Excess Payment or Deficiency Payment will be paid, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled to
such payment, by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or Parent, as
applicable, no later than five Business Days following the final determination
of the Actual Closing Net Working Capital.

2.10 Closing Payment Procedures.

(a) Paying Agent. U.S. Bank National Association or any other credible bank
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the
Closing may serve as the paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the Merger. (b) Closing Payments. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will make, or cause

such holder's name on the Spreadsheet, an appropriate optionholder letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached as Exhibit E-1, with respect to
holders of Vested Company Options who are subject to income or employment Tax
withholding by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and who are to
receive their portion of the Closing Payment Amount from Parent (or the
Company's third party payroll agent), or Exhibit E-2, with respect to holders
of Vested Company Options who are not subject to income or employment Tax
withholding by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation and who are to receive
their portion of the Closing Payment Amount from the Paying Agent
(collectively, the "Optionholder Letters of Transmittal"). As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, and upon receipt by the Paying Agent or
Parent, as applicable, of such Optionholder Letters of Transmittal and any
other documents required pursuant to such Optionholder Letter of Transmittal,
the holder of such Vested Company Option will be entitled to receive from the
Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, that portion of the Closing Payment
Amount to which such holder is entitled, less any applicable Tax withholding
and without interest. No portion of the Closing Payment Amount may be paid to
the holder of any Vested Company Option unless and until the holder of record
of such Vested Company Option has delivered to the Paying Agent or Parent, as
applicable, the appropriate Optionholder Letter of Transmittal and any other
documents required pursuant to such Optionholder Letter of Transmittal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent, in its
sole discretion, may elect to make all payments to the holders of Vested
Company Options through the payroll system (including through a third party
payroll agent) used by Parent or its Affiliates and, in such event, Parent
will not be obligated to make the payment to the Paying Agent contemplated by
Section 2.10(b)(ii).

(ii) As soon as practicable (and in any event within five Business Days) after
the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise
deliver to each Company Stockholder a stockholder letter of transmittal in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit E-3 (the "Stockholder Letter of
Transmittal" and together with the Optionholder Letters of Transmittal, the
"Letters of Transmittal") to the address set forth opposite such Company
Stockholder's name on the Spreadsheet. After receipt of a Stockholder Letter
of Transmittal and any other documents required pursuant to the Stockholder
Letter of Transmittal (the "Exchange Documents"), such Company Stockholder
will surrender all certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock
to the Paying Agent for cancellation together with duly completed and validly
executed Exchange Documents. Upon (and in any event within three Business Days
following) surrender of such certificates and Exchange Documents, such Company
Stockholder will be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent, by check or
wire transfer of immediately available funds (as identified by the Company
Stockholder in the Stockholder Letter of Transmittal), the cash constituting
the portion of the Closing Payment Amount to which such Company Stockholder is
entitled (it being understood that such amount will not include the Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Amount, which amount has been deposited with the Escrow
Agent), less any applicable Tax withholding and without interest. The stock
certificates so surrendered will be cancelled. Until so surrendered, after the
Effective Time, each stock certificate will be deemed, for all corporate
purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the consideration
provided for in this Article II.

(iii) The Closing Payment Amount will be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the written mutual consent of Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, but no gain or loss thereon or income or loss generated
thereby will affect the amounts payable by Parent pursuant to this Article II.
Earnings on the Closing Payment Amount will be the sole and exclusive property
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings will
accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Capital Stock or Company Options
and such holders will not be responsible for Taxes owed for income thereon. (d) Expense Fund. At the Closing, the Paying Agent shall distribute the
Expense Fund Amount to the Securityholder Representative, which shall be
maintained by the Securityholder Representative in a segregated account. By
virtue of this Agreement, each Indemnifying Party hereby agrees that a Pro
Rata Portion of the Expense Fund Amount shall be withheld from the
consideration payable to such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement
and be delivered to the Securityholder Representative to serve as the Expense
Fund.

2.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All consideration
paid in respect of the surrender of shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
and there will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

2.12 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates will be liable to a holder of any
shares of Company Capital Stock for any shares transferred or amounts paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. At any time following the last day of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent will be entitled to require its agent to deliver to
Parent or its designated successor or assign all of the Total Consideration
that has been deposited with such agent pursuant to this Agreement and not
disbursed pursuant to Section 2.7, and thereafter the Company Securityholders
will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the
terms of Section 2.7) as general creditors thereof with respect to any amounts
that may be payable to such Persons pursuant to Section 2.7 or Section 2.10.
No interest will be payable for the amounts delivered to Parent pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.12 and that are subsequently delivered to the
Company Securityholders.

2.13 Transfers of Ownership. If any payments are to be made to a Person other
than the Person whose name is reflected on the certificate representing the
shares of Company Capital Stock surrendered in exchange for such payment, it
will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment of any portion of the Total Consideration in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

2.14 Surrender of Stock Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock
Certificates. No portion of the Total Consideration will be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock
with respect to the shares formerly represented thereby until the holder of
record of such certificate has surrendered such certificate and the Exchange
Documents. In the event that any certificate representing shares of Company
Capital Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or its agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section
2.7, except that Parent or its agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Person who is the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to either (a) deliver a
bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct (not to exceed 2% of the value
portion of the Total Consideration payable in respect of the shares
represented by such certificate) or (b) provide an indemnification agreement
in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent or its agent against
any Claim that may be made against Parent or its agent with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.15 Additional Adjustments to Total Consideration. The applicable portion of
the Total Consideration payable to holders of Company Capital Stock hereunder,
and any other applicable numbers or amounts, will be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time.

assets or properties of such party, its Affiliates or of the Company; (ii) the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of such party, its Affiliates or
the Company to conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or

Company; or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on such party, its
Affiliates or the Company under any statute, rule, regulation, executive

(ii) or (iii), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing herein will require Parent
to litigate with any third party, including any Governmental Entity. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and to cause each of its
Affiliates to file in conjunction with such party, all applications, requests,
notices and other filings with any applicable Governmental Entity whose
approval is required in connection with the consummation of the Merger,
including (as applicable) Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act and
any other required filings, if any, as set forth in Exhibit K as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event no later
than seven Business Days following the date of this Agreement. Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate in their efforts to obtain any governmental consent required for the
Closing.

6.7 Contract Consents, Amendments and Terminations. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Contract
(including those listed on Schedule 7.2(d)(i)) as are required thereunder in
connection with the Merger or for any such Contracts to remain in full force and effect, including those consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to
any Contract listed on Schedule 7.2(d)(i); and (b) send each of the notices
set forth in Schedule 7.2(d)(ii) and any other notices required under any
Contract in connection with the Merger promptly following the date of this
Agreement. Parent must be provided a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the forms of such consents, waivers, approvals and notices.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to make any
payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration in
order to obtain the consent or waiver of any third party with respect to the
Merger (the "No Payment Exclusion"). Prior to or in connection with the
Closing, the Company may pay (using the Company's cash) all change of control,
bonus, severance or other similar payments that are incurred by the Company,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to Employees as of the
Effective Time solely as a result of the consummation of the Merger (but
excluding any "double trigger" arrangements that are triggered as a result of
the Merger and another event) and excluding any Transaction Payroll Taxes
related to the foregoing amounts (the "Change of Control Fees").

6.8 Expenses and Fees.

(f) Payment. If the Merger is consummated, all fees and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company prior to the Closing in connection with the Merger,
including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other
fees and expenses of third parties incurred by the Company in connection with
the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby ("Third Party Expenses"), will be the obligation of the Company. The
Company will provide Parent with a statement of Estimated Third Party Expenses
and an estimate of all Change of Control Fees showing in reasonable detail
both the unpaid Third Party Expenses and Change of Control Fees incurred by
the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Statement of Expenses") at least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and on the Closing Date the Statement
of Expenses will be certified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer as
true, correct and complete as of the Closing Date. The Company may pay (using
the Company's cash) all Third Party Expenses and any Change of Control Fees on
or prior to the Closing Date. If not so paid, such Third Party Expenses and
Change of Control Fees will be paid by Parent at the Closing (in which case
such Third Party Expenses or Change of Control Fees that are unpaid as of the
Closing and then paid by Parent will, without duplication, be deducted from
the definition of Total Consideration). Any Third Party Expenses or Change of
Control Fees that are not reflected on the Statement of Expenses and not
otherwise accounted for in the calculation of the Total Consideration ("Excess
Expenses and Fees") will be indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(vii). Parent shall pay the filing fees associated with the HSR Act and
any other antitrust filings or notifications that may be required in
jurisdictions outside of the United States.

(g) Non-consummation. If the Merger is not consummated, each party hereto will
pay its own fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith, and no party
will be liable to any other party for any costs or expenses incurred in
connection herewith.

6.9 280G Approval. The Company will promptly after the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date)
submit to the Company Stockholders for approval by the requisite vote (in a manner satisfactory to
Parent), by such number of the Company Stockholders as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code (the "280G Vote"), any payments or
benefits to any Employee that is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Section 280G(c) of the Code) that (1) may, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (2) exceed three times minus one dollar such Employee's "base amount"
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1-280G-1 QandA 34) (such
payments described in (1) and (2), the "280G Payments"), such that all such
payments and benefits will not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company will deliver to Parent evidence
satisfactory to Parent that, as to any such Section 280G Payments, a vote of
the Company Stockholders was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and either (a) that such requisite
stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any Section 280G Payment
(the "280G Approval"); or (b) that the 280G Approval was not obtained with
respect to any Section 280G Payment and, as a consequence, that such payments
or benefits will not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any
amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to a 280G waiver
agreement (substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F) (a "280G
Waiver"), which was executed prior to the 280G Vote by each Employee who might
who might receive any 280G Payments. The determination of the 280G Payments
will be made by the Company and will be subject to prior review and approval
by Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Parent shall provide the Company with all relevant terms of any employment
contracts or other arrangements that will be entered into with the
"disqualified individuals" that could result in payments and other terms that
need to be approved (or disclosed) to ensure that the 280G Approval is valid.

6.10 Pre-Closing Employee Matters.

(d) New Employees and Contractors. Each person who becomes an employee of the
Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing will be
required by the Company to enter into and execute a proprietary information

employment or service. Each Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of

or appropriate to effect the release of all Liens set forth in Schedule 6.12.

6.13 FIRPTA Compliance. On the Closing Date, the Company must deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement (a "FIRPTA Compliance Certificate"), in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent, certifying the interests in the Company
are not U.S. real property interests for purposes of satisfying Parent's obligations under Treasury Regulations Section

notice to the IRS on behalf of the Company after the Closing.

6.14 Repayment of Company Indebtedness. Parent is entitled to recover the
amount of any and all Closing Indebtedness to the extent that such Closing
Indebtedness is not paid in full and finally discharged by the Company (or is

Effective Time by reducing the Total Consideration by the amount of any such
unpaid Closing Indebtedness (or the amount of any such Closing Indebtedness
paid by Parent on the Company's behalf). The Company must deliver to Parent,
at least one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, executed payoff letters
or final invoices, as applicable, from each lender, creditor, noteholder or

(except obligations for indemnification and reimbursement that expressly
survive repayment in full) and of all current and future Liens relating to
such item; and (c) contemplating the delivery of UCC-3 termination statements
and mortgage releases that when filed or recorded, as the case may be, will be
sufficient to release any and all Liens relating to such item.

6.15 Joinder and Waiver Agreement. The Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joinder and Waiver Agreement to be executed on
or prior to the Closing Date by the holders of at least 80% of the shares of
Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming the exercise of all Vested Company Options and
Company Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time).

6.16 Post-Closing Employee Matters.

(c) Compensation and Benefits. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Continuing
Employees base salaries that are no less than those that are provided by the
Company to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.16(a) shall require Parent
to provide substantially comparable equity and long-term incentive
compensation. Without limiting the foregoing:

(iii) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time
to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
(without duplication of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued
personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such
accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and
policies of the Company. (iv) Parent shall be solely responsible for all termination and severance
benefits (which benefits, for the avoidance of doubt, shall either be provided
under the plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or the Company Employee Plans),
costs, charges and liabilities of any nature incurred with respect to the
termination of any Continuing Employees after the Effective Time, including
any claims arising out of or relating to any mass layoff or similar event
under applicable Law occurring on or after the Effective Time.

(v) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporation's health and welfare benefit
plans; provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Section 6.16 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at any time, and
(ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or
welfare benefit plan, then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition
period), Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the
Surviving Corporation's health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that
coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under a Company
Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health
or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such
health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
allowances and benefit accrual (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the same
extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company. In addition,
Parent shall in no event apply an eligibility limitation, waiting period or
other condition under any group health or welfare plan with respect to
Continuing Employees and the eligible dependents of Continuing Employees,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such individuals to the extent not satisfied as of the Effective
Time under the corresponding Company Employee Plan. To the extent that any
Continuing Employee or any eligible dependent of a Continuing Employee is
transferred during a plan year from coverage under one or more of the Company
Employee Plans to coverage under a successor group health and welfare plan,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the affected Continuing Employee, or eligible dependent
with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments)
made during the plan year in which the transfer occurs for the purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such successor benefit plan, program or arrangement.

6.17 Management Incentive Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall adopt
the Management Incentive Plan substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit H (the "Management Incentive Plan"), which will become effective as of
the Effective Time.

6.18 Indemnification of Company Officers and Directors.

(a) Indemnification. For six years following the Closing, Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor all rights to
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former officers and directors
(including, if applicable, their directors, officers, partners, employees,
agents, spouses and controlling persons) of the Company currently indemnified by the
Company under the agreements between the Company and such Persons existing as
of the date of this Agreement and set forth on Schedule 6.18(a) (such Persons,
the "Company Indemnitees"), including any provisions existing in the Charter
Documents as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
successors will (i) be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law and
(ii) not be deemed to release any Company Indemnitee who is also an officer or
director of the Company from his or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement
or any Related Agreement. No Company Indemnitee has any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their successors with respect to any Loss claimed by any of the
Indemnified Parties against such Company Indemnitee in his or her capacity as
a Company Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement. The
foregoing will not in any way limit any Company Indemnitee's rights to
coverage under the Tail Policy.

(b) Tail Policy. The Company must purchase prior to or concurrent with the
Closing a prepaid directors' and officers' liability policy or policies (the
"Tail Policy") that will remain in effect until the six year anniversary of
the Effective Time the material terms of which, including coverage and amount,
are comparable to those of the Company's current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy, except that, to the extent that any payments with
respect to such Tail Policy have not been made by the Company prior to or
concurrent with the Closing, then such payments will be deemed to be Third
Party Expenses or Excess Expenses and Fees, as the case may be.

6.19 Transfer Taxes.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise or other Taxes
assessed upon or incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne equally by Parent on the one hand, and the
Company Securityholders on the other hand. The party required to file any Tax
Return related to such Taxes shall file such Tax Return and pay such Taxes and
the other party or parties shall reimburse the paying party for its share of
such Taxes within 10 days of written request. Parent shall have the right to
claim from the Escrow Fund any such Taxes to be borne by the Company
Securityholders.

6.20 Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at the request of another party
hereto, will execute and deliver each document expressly required by this
Agreement and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or
desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, then Parent, Merger Sub and the officers and directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub are fully authorized, in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise, to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger on a timely basis and with no delay (without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or similar concept set forth in such
representations and warranties).

(iv) Each of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in
Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 must have been true and correct in all material
respects on the date they were made and must be true and correct, individually
or in the aggregate, in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date as
though such representations and warranties were made on and as of such date
(other than the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub as of a
specified date, which must be true and correct as of such date) (and without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or similar concept set
forth in such representations and warranties).

(v) Each of Parent and Merger Sub must have performed and complied in all
material respects with each of the covenants and obligations under this
Agreement required to be performed and complied with by such parties as of the
Closing Date.

(h) Certificate of Parent. The Company has received a certificate executed on
behalf of Parent by an officer for and on its behalf to the effect that, as of
the Closing, the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) have been satisfied.

ARTICLE VIII 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; ESCROW ARRANGEMENTS

8.1 Survival.

(v) Survival Periods. The representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or in any certificate, agreement, document or other
instrument required to be executed and delivered by the Company pursuant to
this Agreement (the "Certificates"), will survive the Closing and the
Effective Time and remain in full force and effect until 11:59 p.m., Pacific
time, on the date that is one year after the Closing Date (the "Survival
Date"); provided, however, that: (i) the Fundamental Representations will
survive the Closing and the Effective Time and remain in full force and effect
until the expiration of the statutes of limitations (including extensions thereof) applicable to the subject matters referenced therein (and
with respect to the Fundamental Representations, the Survival Date means such
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including extensions
thereof)); and (ii) in the event of fraud of or by the Company with respect to
any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any Certificate,
such representation or warranty will survive until the statute of limitation
applicable to fraud under applicable Law. If a Claim Certificate asserting a
breach of a representation or warranty is delivered before the date on which
such representation or warranty ceases to survive pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, then the claims specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate will survive for the benefit of all Indemnified Parties beyond the
expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty until such claims are resolved in accordance with this Article VIII.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing survival periods supersede
any applicable statute of limitations applicable to such representations or
warranties. It is the express intent of the parties that, if the applicable
survival period for an item as contemplated by this Section 8.1 is shorter
than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to
such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened survival period
contemplated hereby. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Section 8.1 for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are
the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend
for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

(w) Parent's Representations. The representations and warranties of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other
instrument required to be delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, will survive the Closing and the Effective Time and remain in full
force and effect until the Survival Date; provided, however, that if a written
claim asserting a breach of a representation or warranty is delivered before
the date on which such representation or warranty ceases to survive pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, then the claims specifically set forth in such
claim will survive for the benefit of all Company Securityholders beyond the
expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty until such claims are resolved.

(x) Covenants. The agreements, covenants and other obligations of the parties
hereto will survive the Closing and the Effective Time in accordance with
their respective terms and, in any event, for a period of at least one year
after the Closing Date.

8.2 Indemnification.

(i) Indemnifiable Matters. By virtue of the Merger, subject to the provisions
of this Article VIII, from and after the Effective Time, the Indemnifying
Parties agree to severally and not jointly, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and
its directors, officers and other employees, Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation), agents and other representatives (each, an
"Indemnified Party") from and against all Claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, deficiencies, costs, interest, awards, judgments, Taxes, penalties
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and
expenses and including any such expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing (each, a
"Loss") paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or
any of them, directly or indirectly, as a result of, arising out of or in connection
with the following (the "Indemnifiable Matters"):

(i) (A) any failure of any representation or warranty (other than any
Fundamental Representations) made by the Company in this Agreement to be true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date with
the same force and effect as if such representation or warranty had been made
at and as of the Closing Date; and (B) any failure of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in any Certificate executed and delivered by the
Company to be true and correct at and as of the date of such Certificate;

(ii) (A) any failure of any Fundamental Representations to be true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date with the same force
and effect as if such representation or warranty had been made at and as of
the Closing Date; and (B) any failure of any Fundamental Representation made
by the Company in any Certificate to be true and correct at and as of the date
of such Certificate;

(iii) any breach of or failure by the Company to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement applicable to it set forth in this Agreement prior to
the Closing;

(iv) any (A) Claims by or purportedly on behalf of any current or former
holder or alleged holder of any security of the Company (including any
predecessors) in their capacity as such (1) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any Certificates, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
the allocation of the Total Consideration, except for claims to enforce this
Agreement or with respect to breaches of this Agreement or any Certificate by
Parent; or (2) of or for breach of fiduciary duty by the directors of the
Company with respect to acts or omission occurring before the Closing; and (B)
without duplication, any Dissenting Share Payments in excess of the value that
such Person would have received in the Merger for such Dissenting Shares had
such shares been converted pursuant to Section 2.7(d), and all interest,
costs, expenses and fees incurred by Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the exercise or attempted exercise of any
dissenters' rights;

(v) any Claim by any actual or purported holder of Company Options for
consideration in respect of such Company Options different than as provided in
this Agreement, including pursuant to the Plan;

(vi) any inaccuracy or omission in the Spreadsheet, including any amounts set
forth therein that are paid to a Person in excess of the amounts such Person
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement or any amounts that a Person
was entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement that was omitted from the
Spreadsheet;

(vii) any (A) Excess Expenses and Fees; (B) Closing Indebtedness to the extent
that such Closing Indebtedness did not reduce the Total Consideration; and (C)
any Deficiency Payment; (viii) any Pre-Closing Taxes, except to the extent that such amount was
reflected as a liability in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital;

(ix) any Claim by any actual or purported Company Securityholder relating to
any alleged action or failure to act on its behalf by the Securityholder
Representative or asserting any right to receive such Company Securityholder's
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount (if any) on an accelerated basis rather
than in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII;

(x) any fraud in this Agreement or any Certificate on the part of the Company
prior to the Closing; or

(xi) any product returns that are made before 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to Company Products sold
on or before the Closing Date.

(j) No Reimbursement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the
Charter Documents or any agreement between the Company and any Company
Securityholder to the contrary, in no event will the Surviving Corporation, as
the successor in interest to the Company by virtue of the Merger, or Parent or
any of Parent's other Affiliates be obligated to reimburse, contribute,
advance expenses, indemnify or hold harmless any Company Securityholder or any
of the Company's directors or officers for or in connection with any Losses
claimed by any Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, other than as
permitted pursuant to director and officer indemnification insurance policies.

(k) Materiality Scrape. For the purpose of this Article VIII, only when
determining the amount of Losses paid, suffered, incurred or sustained by an
Indemnified Party as a result of, arising out of or in connection with any
breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company or any
failure by the Company or any Indemnifying Party to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement applicable to it that is qualified or limited in scope
as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect, such representation or
warranty will be deemed to be made without such qualification or limitation
(but such qualification or limitation will be taken into account in
determining the existence of any breach, inaccuracy or failure of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement).

(l) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any indemnity payments made under this
Agreement will be treated as purchase price adjustments for federal and state
income Tax purposes unless otherwise required by Law.

8.3 Indemnification Limitations.

(c) Aggregate Limitations; Order of Recovery. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 8.3, (i) the Escrow Fund will constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties for Indemnifiable Matters pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(i) and Section 8.2(a)(xi) (subject to clause (ii)(B) below);
and (ii) the maximum amount that the Indemnified Parties may recover from any
Indemnifying Party for Losses in respect of any Indemnifiable Matters (A)
under Section 8.2(a)(i) will be limited to an amount equal to such Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Portion in the Escrow Fund (and for the avoidance of doubt
capped at the Escrow Fund with respect to all Indemnifying Parties); (B) under
Section 8.2(a)(xi) will be limited to an amount equal to such Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate amount of product returns in excess
of $1,000,000 but in no event more than the lesser of (x) $6,000,000 and (y)
the funds remaining in the Escrow Fund; and (C) subject to the limitations in
the foregoing clauses "(A)" and "(B)," with respect to all matters under
Section 8.2(a) will be limited to such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion
of the Total Consideration and in any event no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to the Indemnified Parties in excess of the actual cash received by
such Indemnifying Party, except in the event of fraud in connection with this
Agreement committed by such Indemnifying Party or by an Indemnifying Party
with actual advance (on or before the Closing) knowledge of the commission of
such fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all claims by the
Indemnified Parties for Losses pursuant to this Article VIII shall be
recovered (x) first, from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Sections 8.4 through 8.6 and (y) second, subject to the
applicable limitations set forth in this Article VIII, including this Section
8.3, when either the Escrow Fund has been exhausted or the aggregate amount of
the claims made by the Indemnified Parties for indemnifiable matters exceeds
the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund, directly from the Indemnifying
Parties.

(d) Threshold. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.3, no
Indemnified Party will be entitled to recover any Losses in respect of any
Indemnifiable Matters under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of
Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Threshold"). After the
Threshold is reached, the Indemnified Parties will be entitled to recover the
full amount and not only the Losses in excess of the Threshold.

(e) Other Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement:

(i) nothing in this Agreement will limit the liability of the Company or
Parent for any willful or intentional breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth in this Agreement, any Related Agreements or in any
certificates or other instruments executed and delivered pursuant to this
Agreement if the Merger is not consummated;

(ii) nothing herein shall prevent the Indemnified Parties from pursuing any
remedies against any Indemnifying Party for committing any fraud with respect
to this Agreement or any certificates or other instruments executed and
delivered by such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement or against any
Indemnifying Party with actual advance (on or before the Closing) knowledge of
the commission of such fraud;

(iii) any Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss
under this Article VIII notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party
had knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss
prior to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto; (iv) if an Indemnified Party's claim under this Article VIII may be brought
under different sections of Section 8.2(a), then such Indemnified Party will
have the right to bring such claim under any applicable section it chooses in
accordance with this Article VIII;

(v) nothing in this Agreement will limit the rights of any party hereto to
apply for equitable remedies to enforce the other party or parties'
obligations hereunder; and

(vi) nothing in this Agreement will limit the right of any Indemnified Party
to pursue remedies under: (A) the Confidentiality Agreement, (B) the 280G
Waivers, (C) the Key Employee Offer Letters, or (D) (1) the Joinder and Waiver
Agreements, and (2) the Letters of Transmittal (the agreements covered in
clauses "(A)" through "(D)" are referred to herein as the "Excluded
Agreements") against the parties thereto, provided, however, that with respect
to the Excluded Agreements covered by clauses (D) the caps and limitations set
forth in Section 8.3(a) shall apply.

(f) Effect of Insurance Recovery and Other Limitations. For purposes of
calculating the amount of Losses, there will be deducted therefrom an amount
equal to: (i) the amount of any proceeds actually received by any Indemnified
Party from any third party insurer in connection with such Losses (net of
applicable costs of recovery or collection thereof as well as any reserves,
deductibles, premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums), it being
understood that there is no obligation on Parent or any of its Affiliates to
pursue any recovery through insurance; and (ii) any indemnification,
contribution or other payment actually received from any third Person with
respect to such Loss (net of all costs of collection). The Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to recover more than once for the same Loss and shall
not be entitled to recover any Loss if and to the extent that such Loss is
reflected in the calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Excess Expenses and Fees
or Closing Net Working Capital (to the extent of such inclusion).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the definition of Losses
shall exclude any unforeseeable consequential damages, diminution in value,
special, punitive or exemplary damages, except and only to the extent granted
to third parties pursuant to a final non-appealable judgement of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

(h) Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification provided in this Article VIII,
subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-
Closing remedy available to the Indemnified Parties with respect to any matter
resulting from, arising from or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

8.4 Indemnification Claims Procedures.

(h) Making a Claim for Indemnification; Claim Certificate. If an Indemnified
Party believes in good faith that it has or may acquire a right to
indemnification under this Article VIII, such Indemnified Party may make an
indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a) by delivering a certificate
(a "Claim Certificate") to the Securityholder Representative, with a copy to
the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Losses described in the Claim
Certificate are recoverable by seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund), or
to one or more Indemnifying Parties (if and to the extent that the Losses described in the Claim Certificate are
recoverable by seeking recourse directly against any such Indemnifying Party),
(i) stating that such Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, suffered or
incurred (or in good faith anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain,
suffer or incur) Losses; and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail, to the
extent known, the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated,
the date that each such item was paid, sustained, suffered or incurred, or the
basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the Indemnifiable
Matter to which such item is related. The Claim Certificate (A) need only
specify such information to the knowledge of such Indemnified Party as of the
Claim Date, and (B) may be updated and amended from time to time by the
Indemnified Party with respect to the amount or new facts or circumstance
known to the Indemnified Party (but not by making new claims) by delivering an
updated or amended Claim Certificate to the Securityholder Representative or
applicable Indemnifying Parties, as the case may be, with a copy to the Escrow
Agent (if and to the extent that the Losses described in the Claim Certificate
are recoverable by seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund). The date of
delivery of a Claim Certificate is referred to herein as the "Claim Date" of
such Claim Certificate (and the claims for indemnification set forth therein).

(i) Objecting to a Claim for Indemnification; Objection Notice.

(iv) Following its receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Securityholder
Representative (or in the case of a claim directly against one or more
Indemnifying Parties, such Indemnifying Parties) may object to any item(s) or
amount(s) set forth therein by delivering written notice thereof (an
"Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Party submitting such Claim Certificate
at the addresses of such Indemnified Party set forth in such Claim
Certificate, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the
Losses described in the Claim Certificate are recoverable only by seeking
recourse against the Escrow Fund). To be effective such Objection Notice must
(i) be delivered to the Indemnified Party (and, in the case of a claim for
recourse against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent) prior to 5:00 p.m.,
Pacific time, on the 30th day following the date the Claim Certificate was
received by the Securityholder Representative or the Indemnifying Party, as
applicable (such deadline, the "Objection Deadline"); and (ii) set forth in
reasonable detail the nature of the objections to the claims in the Claim
Certificate in respect of which the objection is made.

(v) If the Securityholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, if
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such Indemnifying
Party) does not object as provided in Section 8.4(b)(i) to any item or amount
set forth in an Claim Certificate prior to the Objection Deadline for such
Claim Certificate, then such failure to object will be an irrevocable
acknowledgement by the Securityholder Representative (or the Indemnifying
Party, if indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from such
Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount
of the claims for Losses set forth in such Claim Certificate, subject to the
limitations contained in this Article VIII (and such entitlement will be
conclusively and irrefutably established) with respect to the Indemnifying
Party against whom indemnification has been sought (any such claim, an
"Unobjected Claim").

(vi) With respect to an Unobjected Claim against the Escrow Fund, promptly
following the Objection Deadline for the Claim Certificate, the Escrow Agent
must release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to any Indemnified Party that has previously
delivered such Claim Certificate an amount equal to the amount of Losses set
forth in such Unobjected Claim (not to exceed the amount then remaining in the
Escrow Fund). With respect to an Unobjected Claim for which the Indemnifying
Party is directly liable beyond the amount of the Escrow Fund, within 30 days
of a claim becoming an Unobjected Claim, the applicable Indemnifying Party
will make the applicable payment to such Indemnified Party, subject to the
limitations contained in Section 8.3 and Section 8.6.

(j) Procedure Following an Objection. If the Securityholder Representative (or
the Indemnifying Party, if indemnification is being sought hereunder directly
from such Indemnifying Party) does object as provided in Section 8.4(b) to any
item or amount set forth in any Claim Certificate, then the Securityholder
Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party
will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If the Securityholder Representative (or
the objecting Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by the
Securityholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) and the
Indemnified Party and, in the case of a claim against the Escrow Fund, will be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms hereof.

(k) Resolution of Conflicts.

(iv) If the Securityholder Representative (or the Indemnifying Party, in the
case of a claim for indemnification sought directly from an Indemnifying
Party) timely delivers an Objection Notice in accordance with Section
8.4(b)(i), then the Securityholder Representative (or such objecting
Indemnifying Party) and Parent (for itself and on behalf of any other
Indemnified Party) will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties to resolve the objections in the Objection Notice with
respect to each such claim. Either the Securityholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Parent may, but will not be obligated to,
initiate non-binding mediation of the dispute with the assistance of a neutral
arbitrator belonging to and under the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution. The party requesting the mediation will arrange for mediation
services, subject to the approval of the other party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Mediation will take place in
Santa Clara County, California during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice. Mediation may be scheduled to begin at any time,
but with at least 10 Business Days' written notice to all parties. If one
party initiates mediation, then the parties will (A) participate in the
mediation in good faith and devote reasonable time and energy to the mediation
so as to promptly resolve the dispute or conclude that they cannot resolve the
dispute; and (B) not pursue other remedies while such mediation is proceeding.
If the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting Indemnifying Party) and
Parent reach an agreement, then a memorandum setting forth such agreement will
be prepared and signed by the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party and, in the case of a claim
against the Escrow Fund, will be furnished to the Escrow Agent and, in the
case of a claim directly against the Indemnifying Parties, to the Indemnifying
Parties. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

(v) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation (and, if
applicable, mediation) prior to 90 days following the date an Objection Notice
is deemed properly delivered, given and received pursuant to Section 10.1,
then either Parent or the Securityholder Representative (or the objecting
Indemnifying Party) may bring suit in the courts identified in Section 10.7 to
resolve the matter. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate will be nonappealable, binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent will
be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the Escrow Agent must
distribute the amounts from the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

8.5 Third Party Claims. In the event that any Indemnified Party becomes aware
of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") that such Indemnified Party in
good faith believes may result in a claim for indemnification, such
Indemnified Party will, as promptly as practicable, notify the Securityholder
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such claim.
The failure to so notify the Securityholder Representative (or such
Indemnifying Party, if applicable) of the commencement of any such Third Party
Claim will relieve the Indemnifying Parties from liability in connection
therewith only if and to the extent that such failure materially and adversely
affects the ability of the Indemnifying Parties to defend their interests in
such Third Party Claim. The Securityholder Representative will be entitled, on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party
will be entitled) at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties, to participate
in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of, or settlement
negotiations with respect to, such Third Party Claim. The Securityholder
Representative or the Indemnifying Party, as applicable, will have the right
to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
the Third Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
affect any privilege relating to the other party (provided that the parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such effect, including by
executing joint defense agreement) and the Indemnified Party will keep the
other party reasonably informed and updated as to the status of the Third
Party Claim at all times pending resolution thereof. The Indemnified Party
will have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to
settle, any such Third Party Claim, but, except with the written consent
(which may be given in the sole discretion) of the Securityholder
Representative (or, in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party), no
settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants will be
determinative of (i) the existence or amount of Losses relating to such matter
or (ii) unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by the Securityholder
Representative or the Indemnifying Party, the existence of an Indemnifiable
Matter. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if adversely determined would
give rise to a right of recovery for Losses, then 25% of any amounts paid,
sustained, suffered or reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in defense
of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such Third Party
Claim, will be deemed to be Losses. In the event that the Securityholder Representative has consented to any such settlement with respect to an
Indemnifiable Matter under Section 8.2(a), then the Indemnifying Parties will
have no power or authority to object under any provision of this Article VIII
to the amount of any Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Parties against the
Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement.

8.6 Escrow Arrangements.

(h) Escrow Fund. By virtue of this Agreement and as partial security for the
Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2(a), at the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount without any act of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with Section 2.10(b)(iii). Such deposit of
the Escrow Amount will constitute an escrow fund (together with any interest
accrued thereon, the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth
herein. The Escrow Fund will be available to compensate the Indemnified
Parties for any claims for any Losses paid, sustained, suffered or incurred by
them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this Article VIII
(subject to the limitations set forth in Article VIII). The Escrow Agent may
execute this Agreement following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, and such later execution will not affect the binding nature of this
Agreement as of the date of this Agreement between the other parties hereto.

(i) Distribution of the Escrow Fund.

(vi) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund will be in
existence immediately following the Effective Time and will terminate at 11:59
p.m., Pacific time, on the Survival Date (such period, the "Escrow Period").

(vii) Within three Business Days following the end of the Escrow Period, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Indemnifying Parties all (x) amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund minus (y)
the amounts claimed pursuant to any unresolved claims specified in any Claim
Certificate delivered prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period
("Unresolved Claims" and the sum of such amounts specified in clause "(y)" is
referred to as "Unresolved Claims Amount"). At such time, the Escrow Fund will
not terminate, the Escrow Agent may not disburse the Unresolved Claims Amount,
and any such amount will not be distributed to the Indemnifying Parties.

(viii) As soon as an Unresolved Claim has been resolved, Parent and the
Securityholder Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to deliver the portion of the Unresolved Claims Amount with respect to
such Unresolved Claim, if any, not required to satisfy such Unresolved Claim
(A) first, to the Securityholder Representative for any Securityholder
Representative Expenses; and (B) second, to the Indemnifying Parties, as
instructed by the Securityholder Representative.

(ix) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Escrow
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any property in the Escrow
Fund deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Indemnifying Party such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, then such amounts will be treated for all purposes as having been paid
to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(x) Deliveries of the Escrow Amount out of the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to this Section 8.6 will be made in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund, with
the amount delivered to each Indemnifying Party rounded to the nearest 0.01
(with amounts 0.005 and above rounded up), except that any such amounts
payable to holders of Company Options will be rounded down to the nearest
cent. If the sum of the Pro Rata Portions, each rounded to the nearest 0.01
(with amounts 0.005 and above rounded up), does not equal the remaining
amounts in the Escrow Fund, then the appropriate amount will be added to or
subtracted from the Indemnifying Party with the greatest Pro Rata Portion such
that the sum of the rounded Pro Rata Portions does equal the remaining amount
in the Escrow Fund.

(j) Protection of the Escrow Fund; Tax Reporting.

(iii) The Escrow Agent will (A) hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, (B) treat the Escrow Fund as trust funds in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and (C) hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and Section 2.10. The parties
hereto agree that Parent is the owner of the cash in the Escrow Fund and that
all interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of
such cash in the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement will be treated for
tax purposes as earned by Parent. The Escrow Agent will pay to Parent out of
the Escrow Fund, on or before the 10th day following the end of each calendar
quarter during the Escrow Period, a distribution equal to 20% of the amount of
such taxable income treated for tax purposes as earned by Parent.

(iv) Each of Parent and, prior to the Closing, the Company and, after the
Closing, the Securityholder Representative will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each Indemnifying Party to provide to the Escrow Agent any
necessary Tax forms, including a duly executed Form W-9 or the appropriate
series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar form reasonably requested by
the Escrow Agent, but the Escrow Agent will rely upon (and obtain copies from
Parent as necessary, to the extent that Parent has received such forms prior
to the Closing) all tax forms used and collected by Parent in connection with
payments made in connection with the Closing pursuant to Section 2.10(b).

(v) Any cash in the Escrow Fund must be invested in Permitted Investments as
determined from time to time by Parent and the Securityholder Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the absence of written instructions to the
contrary, funds will be invested in the Escrow Agent's Money Market Deposit
Account as more fully described in Exhibit I. Any interest paid on the Escrow
Amount will be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof and
available for satisfaction of claims. The Escrow Agent will have no liability
for any investment losses, including any market loss for any investment
liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a payment required hereunder.
For all U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax reporting and withholding
purposes, the Indemnifying Parties will not be treated as having received or contributed any cash portion of the Escrow Amount, or as owners of any portion
of the Escrow Amount, including any interest or other income or gains from
investment of the Escrow Amount, until it is released and distributed to them.
Parent will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund for tax purposes and
will report any income earned by the Escrow Fund, until the Escrow Fund, if
any, is distributed to the Indemnifying Parties. Any cash and any income
earned thereon released to the Indemnifying Parties from the Escrow Fund will
be (A) treated as additional consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement and
(B) composed of an interest element and a principal element, the interest
element to be computed and reported in accordance with the imputed interest
rules of the Code, which Parent will provide to the Escrow Agent prior to each
distribution from the Escrow Fund.

(vi) In the absence of proper Tax documentation or as required by Law, the
Escrow Agent will withhold such Taxes as are required by applicable Law and
will remit such Taxes to the appropriate authorities. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that (A) there is no sale or
transfer of a United States Real Property Interest as defined under Section
897(c) of the Code in the underlying transaction giving rise to this
Agreement; and (B) except as provided in the Spreadsheet, no Indemnifying
Party is subject to withholding on payments made in connection with the
Merger, other than backup withholding on failure to provide any required tax
documentation. The Indemnifying Parties agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow
Agent harmless from any liability or obligation on account of Taxes,
assessments, additions for late payment, interest, penalties, expenses and
other governmental charges that may be assessed or asserted against the Escrow
Agent in connection with or relating to any payment made or other activities
performed under the terms of this Agreement, including any liability for the
withholding or deduction of (or the failure to withhold or deduct) the same,
and any liability for failure to obtain proper certifications or to report
properly to governmental authorities in connection with this Agreement,
including costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses),
interest and penalties, except to the extent that such amounts relate to the
Escrow Agent's fraud, intentional misrepresentation or gross negligence,
failure to withhold or failure to perform any backup withholding. The
foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold harmless will survive the
termination of this Agreement.

(k) Escrow Agent's Duties.

(vi) The Escrow Agent will be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional joint written escrow instructions that are delivered to the Escrow
Agent after the date of this Agreement that are signed by the Securityholder
Representative and an officer of Parent, and may rely and will be protected in
relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Escrow Agent will not have any implied duties or fiduciary or
discretionary duties of any kind. The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and
any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel will be
conclusive evidence of such good faith.

(vii) Except as set forth herein, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to disregard any and all notices, orders or warnings given by any
of the parties hereto or by any other Person, other than orders or process of
courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court, awards of
arbitrators and joint written instructions executed by Parent and the
Securityholder Representative. If the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such order, judgment or decree of any court, award of arbitrator or joint
written instructions, then the Escrow Agent will not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other Person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or award being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction.

(viii) The Escrow Agent will not be liable in any respect on account of the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder.

(ix) The Escrow Agent will not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

(x) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent will not
be liable to any party for damages, losses or expenses, except as a result of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent will not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith; or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit
provided for in this Agreement, that the Escrow Agent in good faith believes
to be genuine; or (C) forgeries, fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
impersonations by any Person other than the Escrow Agent, or determining the
scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may
consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agent's
duties under this Agreement and will be fully protected in any act taken,
suffered or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining or verifying the
authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party
hereto.

(xi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other Person, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement or its terms
or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agent's discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be
liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, file an
action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims
and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Amounts held in escrow,
except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader
Expenses"), and that the parties agree to pay the Agent Interpleader Expenses
as follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying
Parties on the basis of the Indemnifying Parties' respective Pro Rata
Portions. In the event any Indemnifying Party fails to timely pay such
Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, then
Parent may at its option pay such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the
Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an equal amount from such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata
Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent will
be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability
imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

(xii) Parent and the Indemnifying Parties and their respective successors and
assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent and
each director, officer, employee, agent and affiliate of Escrow Agent
(collectively, the "Agent Indemnified Parties") harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, attorney's fees, including allocated costs of in house
counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on or incurred by any of the
Agent Indemnified Parties arising from or in connection with the performance
or failure of performance of Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement,
including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject
matter (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: 50% to be paid by
Parent and 50% to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties on the basis of each
Indemnifying Party's respective Pro Rata Portions; provided, however, that no
Agent Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified hereunder for
any liability finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, subject
to no further appeal, to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Escrow Agent. In the event that any Indemnifying Party
fails to timely pay Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Agent
Indemnification Expenses, then Parent may at its option pay such Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses and recover an
equal amount from such Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Fund.

(xiii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 days
written notice to Parent and the Securityholder Representative, but no such
resignation will become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow
agent by the joint agreement of Parent and the Securityholder Representative.
The successor escrow agent will execute and deliver an instrument accepting
such appointment, and it will, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent will be discharged from any further duties and
liability under this Agreement, but the provisions hereunder shall inure to
the Escrow Agent's benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was the escrow agent hereunder.

(l) Fees and Expenses. Parent will pay all initial setup and ongoing
maintenance fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Escrow Agent for
performance of its duties hereunder in accordance with the standard fee
schedule of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges
agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent will be considered compensation
for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that (i)
the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, (ii) the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been
requested by an officer of Parent, (iii) the parties request a substantial
modification of the terms of this Agreement or (iv) any controversy arises, or
if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation
pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, then the Escrow Agent
will be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney's fees, including allocated
costs of in house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or litigation.

(m) Successor Escrow Agents. Any Person into which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity is a party,
or any Person to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the
Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, will be the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement without further act.

8.7 Securityholder Representative.

(r) Terms of Appointment. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Indemnifying Parties, each of
the Indemnifying Parties will be deemed to have agreed to appoint the
Securityholder Representative as his, her or its exclusive agent and attorney-
in-fact, as the Securityholder Representative with full power and authority to
act for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties to (i) give and receive
notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from
the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by such Indemnified Party pursuant
to Section 8.2(a); (ii) object to such payments; (iii) agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and request mediation as provided
in this Agreement and comply with orders of courts and awards of mediators
with respect to such claims; (iv) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and request mediation and comply with orders of courts and
awards of mediators with respect to, any other claim or dispute by any
Indemnified Party against any Indemnifying Party or by any Indemnifying Party
against any Indemnified Party; and (v) execute and deliver all documents
necessary or appropriate in the sole opinion of the Securityholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, each
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have agreed to authorize the
Securityholder Representative to take all other actions that are either (A)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative
for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (B) specifically mandated by the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Indemnified
Parties, except as expressly provided herein, and for purposes of clarity,
there are no obligations of the Securityholder Representative in any ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Letter. The Securityholder
Representative may resign at any time. Such agency may be changed by the
Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior
written notice to Parent, but the Securityholder Representative may not be
removed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, voting together
as a single class, agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Securityholder Representative may be filled by the vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, voting together as a single class. The immunities
and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholder Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the
Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement. No bond will be required of the Securityholder Representative. After the Closing,
notices or communications to or from the Securityholder Representative will
constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties.

(s) Advisory Group; Securityholder Representative Expenses. Certain
Indemnified Parties have entered into an engagement agreement with the
Securityholder Representative to provide direction to the Securityholder
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement (such
Indemnified Parties, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the Securityholder
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors,
agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the
"Securityholder Representative Group"), will be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder or under any Securityholder Representative engagement
agreement as Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith and
without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties will
severally and not jointly (based on their Pro Rata Portion) indemnify and
defend the Securityholder Representative and hold the Securityholder
Representative harmless against any losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, judgments, amounts paid in settlement,
fees, costs or expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and
experts and all expenses with respect to document location, duplication and
shipment and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers) arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder
Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder Representative
(collectively, "Securityholder Representative Expenses"), in each case as such
Securityholder Representative Expense is suffered or incurred. If any
Securityholder Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Securityholder Representative, then the Securityholder Representative will
reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified
Securityholder Representative Expenses to the extent attributable to such bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Securityholder Representative by the Indemnifying Parties, any such
Securityholder Representative Expenses will be recovered by the Securityholder
Representative first, from the Expense Fund and second, from, if then
available after satisfaction of all claims of an Indemnified Party, the
amounts in the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution thereof to the
Indemnifying Parties. Although the Securityholder Representative Expenses may
be paid from the Escrow Fund, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties
from their obligation to promptly pay such Securityholder Representative
Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise
incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its
powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Securityholder
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Securityholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Securityholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Securityholder Representative in performing such
actions. (t) Upon the Closing, Parent shall wire to the Securityholder Representative
$150,000 (the "Expense Fund Amount"). The Expense Fund Amount shall be held by
the Securityholder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties in a segregated client account and shall be used (i) for
the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Securityholder
Representative for any Securityholder Representative Expenses incurred
pursuant to this Agreement or any Securityholder Representative letter
agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the "Expense
Fund"). The Securityholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity
in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations hereunder. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Securityholder Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to
be withheld, the Securityholder Representative shall distribute the remaining
Expense Fund (if any) to the Escrow Agent (or directly to the Paying Agent or
Parent if so instructed) for further distribution to the Indemnified Parties.
The Expense Fund Amount shall be considered a Third Party Expense.

(u) The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that the powers, immunities
and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholder Representative
Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and
survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Indemnified
Party and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive
the delivery of an assignment by any Indemnified Party of the whole or any
fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund. Any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 and
Section 9.4, will constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and will
be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties and such
Indemnified Party's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in
writing by such Indemnified Party, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely
upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Representative.
The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and
(iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party or other party. All defenses which
may be available to any Indemnified Party to contest, negate or disaffirm the
action of the Securityholder Representative taken in good faith under this
Agreement are waived.

ARTICLE IX

9.1 Termination. Except as provided in Section 9.2, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

(m) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; (n) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger has not been consummated by
April 15, 2016 (such date, the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b) will not be available to
any party hereto whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

(o) by either the Company or Parent, if any requirement under Law makes the
consummation of the Merger illegal, or if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction, order or other
legal restraint is in effect and that has the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order,
decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable; provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) will not
be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to act has been a
principal cause of or resulted in such requirement under Law or such action;

(p) by Parent, if evidence of the receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval
is not delivered to Parent by 5:00 p.m., Central time, on November 16, 2015;

(q) by Parent, if Parent and Merger Sub are not in material breach of any of
their respective obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set
forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a)
would not be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within 20 days
after written notice thereof has been provided to the Company; provided,
however, that no cure period will be required for a breach that by its nature
cannot be cured and in no event will the cure period extend beyond the End
Date; or

(r) by the Company, if the Company is not in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
would not be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within 20 days
after written notice thereof has been provided to Parent; provided, however,
that no cure period will be required for a breach which by its nature cannot
be cured and in no event will the cure period extend beyond the End Date.

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.1, then this Agreement will become void and there will
be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
representatives, agents or Affiliates, but (a) each party hereto and thereto
will remain liable for any willful or intentional breaches of this Agreement,
any Related Agreements or any Certificate or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination; and (b) the provisions of
Section 6.4, Section 6.5, Section 6.8, Article X and this Section 9.2 will
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Article IX. 9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time
by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the party against
whom enforcement is sought.

9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, and at any time
following the Effective Time, Parent and the Company, on the one hand, and the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
permitted, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
of the other party hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party set forth herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party set forth herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver will
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. For purposes of this Section 9.4, the Indemnifying Parties agree
that any extension or waiver signed by the Securityholder Representative will
be binding upon and effective against all Indemnifying Parties whether or not
they have signed such extension or waiver. No delay or failure by any party
hereto to assert any of its rights or remedies will constitute a waiver of
such rights or remedies.

executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and
the same agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other
parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Any such counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf,
.tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to email (any such delivery, an
"Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No party hereto may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver
a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

10.3 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment. This
Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement, the Disclosure
Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Management Incentive Plan and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior Contracts among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; (b) are not intended
to, and will not, confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
hereunder, other than (i) as set forth in Section 6.18, (ii) the Indemnifying
Parties and (iii) the Indemnified Parties and the Agent Indemnified Parties
with respect to the rights under Article VIII; and (c) will not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates so long as Parent
remains ultimately liable for all of Parent's obligations hereunder.

10.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

10.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement and
specifically subject to Section 8.3(f), any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party hereto will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of
the State of Delaware.

10.7 Dispute Resolution. The parties hereto agree that any legal proceeding by
or against any party hereto or with respect to or arising out of this
Agreement may be brought exclusively in any state or federal court located in New Castle County, Delaware. By
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and to
the appellate courts therefrom solely for the purposes of disputes arising
under the this Agreement and not as a general submission to such jurisdiction
or with respect to any other Claim. The parties hereto irrevocably consent to
the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such
action or proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to
the address for such party to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any
such service of process will be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein will
affect the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law. The parties hereto waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or
proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (a) any Claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such courts for any reason, or that it or any
of its property is immune from the above-described legal process; (b) that
such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for
the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by such courts; or (c) any other defense that would hinder or
delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party
hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

10.8 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.9 USA Patriot Act Compliance. To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each
Person who opens an account. For a non-individual Person, the Escrow Agent
will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses
and identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the Person or other relevant documentation. The parties
hereto each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to
themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

10.10 Escrow Security Procedures.

(c) Security Procedures. Parent and the Securityholder Representative will
each deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate
naming the officers who have the authority to execute and amend this
Agreement. Exhibit J names the authorized representatives who are authorized
to provide disbursement instructions with respect to the Escrow Fund, and the
Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any
such officer or authorized representative. In the event funds transfer
instructions are given, whether in writing or by fax, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
one or more of the persons designated in Schedule 10.10 who is different from
the person who gave the transfer instruction, and the Escrow Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person so designated. The persons and telephone numbers
for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually received and
acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank
in any funds transfer to Parent may rely solely upon any account numbers or
similar identifying numbers provided by Parent to identify (i) the
beneficiary; (ii) the beneficiary's bank; or (iii) an intermediary bank. The
Escrow Agent may apply any of the Escrow Fund for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number in a manner consistent with the
written instructions from (A) Parent, to the extent that it relates to
payments to Parent; or (B) the Securityholder Representative, to the extent
that it relates to payments to the Securityholder Representative or the
Indemnifying Parties. Parent and the Securityholder Representative each
acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this Section 10.10 are
commercially reasonable.

(d) Disbursement to Parent. Unless the Escrow Agent is otherwise instructed in
writing by Parent, Parent acknowledges that the Escrow Agent is authorized to
use the funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to Parent under
this Agreement as set forth on Exhibit J.

10.11 Waiver of Conflicts. Parent agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation not to assert, any attorney-client privilege with
respect to communications between Cooley LLP ("Cooley") and any officer,
director or employee of the Company (a) related to the Merger and (b)
occurring prior to the Closing, other than in the case of fraud in the event
of a reasonable determination by Parent that fraud exists independent of such
attorney client privilege, it being the intention of the parties hereto that
such attorney-client-privilege shall be deemed to be the right of, and
retained by, the Company Securityholders, and not that of the Surviving
Corporation, following the Closing; provided that the foregoing shall in no
event limit or otherwise affect the Surviving Corporation's right to assert
any attorney-client privilege with respect to any such communication against
any Person other than any stockholder, officer, director or employee of the
Company prior to the Closing.
