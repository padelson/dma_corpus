commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act) the Offer. The

the reasonable determination by Parent that any such condition to the Offer

such time, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company Board and (ii) each
board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee
thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on
the Company Board, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, until Parent and/or Merger
Subsidiary acquires a majority of the outstanding Company Shares on a fully-
diluted

     

   

basis, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that all
of the members of the Company Board and such committees and boards as of the
date hereof who are not employees of the Company shall remain members of the
Company Board and such committees and boards until the Effective Time;
_provided_ that in no event shall use of the CompanyÂ’s reasonable best
efforts require the Company to increase the compensation payable to any such
Company Board, committee or board member, in respect of such capacity, other
than in the ordinary course.

  

(b) The CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint ParentÂ’s designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and
shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to
the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section. Parent
shall supply to the Company in writing any information with respect to itself
and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

  

(c) Following the election or appointment of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Parent
shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the
authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any
amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any
decrease in or change of form of the Merger Consideration, any extension of
time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and, as permitted
by and in accordance with Section 7.03, any Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

Section 2.04 _. Top-Up Option. _(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to
Merger Subsidiary an option (the " **Top-Up Option** "), exercisable upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.04, to purchase that number
of Company Shares (the " **Top-Up Option Shares** ") equal to the lowest
number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares
directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary at the time of
such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Company Shares
then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ that in no event shall
the TopÂ—Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company Shares (i) that
would require the Company to obtain shareholder approval under the
Marketplace Rules of Nasdaq to issue the Top-Up Option Shares, or (ii) in
excess of the CompanyÂ’s then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common
Stock (giving effect to Company Shares reserved for issuance under the
Company Stock Plans as if such shares were outstanding).

     

   

(b) _Provided_ that no Applicable Law or Order shall prohibit the exercise of
the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect
thereof, Merger Subsidiary may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not
in part, at any time after the consummation of the Offer and prior to the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that the Company Shares which
Merger Subsidiary may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not
be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Subsidiary represent and warrant to the Company that Merger
Subsidiary is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the 1933
Act.  Merger Subsidiary agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will
be acquired by Merger Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the 1933 Act).

event, within two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article 10, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms
or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
 The Closing shall be held at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless another place is agreed to
by the parties hereto.

  

Section 3.02 _. The Merger. _(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, as soon as practicable after the Closing, the Company and
Merger Subsidiary shall file with the Minnesota Secretary of State articles
of merger (the " **Articles of Merger** ") in connection with the Merger in
such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance
with, the MBCA.

  

(b) The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " **Effective Time**
") as the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Minnesota
Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the Articles
of Merger).

  

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with the MBCA, whereupon the separate

     

   

existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** ").  From and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights,
powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary, all as provided under the MBCA.

  

Section 3.03. _Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

  

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.03(b), Section 3.03(c) or
Section 3.05, each Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (together with the Company Rights attached to each such share)
shall be converted into the right to receive $13.50 in cash or any different
amount paid per Company Share in the Offer, without interest (the " **Merger
Consideration** ");

  

(b) each Company Share owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary (whether pursuant
to the Offer or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective Time (together
with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

  

(c) each Company Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the
same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and

  

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and (in
addition to shares referred to in Section 3.03(c)) shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 3.04 _. Surrender and Payment. _(a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ")
for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates
representing Company Shares (the " **Certificates** ") and (ii) uncertificated
Company Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ").  Parent shall pay to the
Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of Company Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon

     

   

proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

(b) Each holder of Company Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
or (ii) receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 3.04(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder
who has not exchanged Company Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 3.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 3.04(a) in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

     

   

Section 3.05 _. Dissenting Shares. _Notwithstanding Section 3.03, any Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the
Company Rights attached to each such share) (collectively, the " **Dissenting
Shares** ") held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or the Merger and who validly has asserted dissentersÂ’ rights with
respect to the Merger in accordance with the MBCA shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses its dissentersÂ’ rights; _provided_ that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
loses its dissentersÂ’ rights pursuant to the MBCA, such Company Shares
(together with the Company Rights attached to each such share) shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt notice of any notice of dissent with respect to the Merger received by
the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to each such dissent.  Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such dissent.

  

Section 3.06 _. Company Stock Options; Restricted Share Awards.
_(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " **Company Stock Option** ") outstanding
under any stock option or equity compensation plan or agreement (the "
**Company Stock Plans** "), other than any employee stock purchase plan, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time
into an option to acquire shares of Parent Stock, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option
(including vesting schedule), except that (i) the number of shares of Parent
Stock subject to each such option shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the " **Option
Exchange Ratio** "), the numerator of which is the per share Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of
Parent Stock on Nasdaq over the five trading days immediately preceding (but
not including) the Closing Date (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and
(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y) the
Option Exchange Ratio. No Company Stock Options shall become vested solely
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share Award
that is held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be converted automatically into a substantially similar award for Parent
Stock and shall remain subject to the vesting conditions in effect on the
date hereof, except that the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each
such assumed award

     

   

shall be determined by multiplying the number of Company Shares subject to
such Company Restricted Share Award by the Option Exchange Ratio.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options,
and (ii) have any resolutions passed by the Company Board or make any
amendments to the terms of such Company Stock Options or Company Stock Plans,
in each case, that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 3.06.  Without limitation of the
foregoing, the Company Board shall take such actions as are necessary to
cause any Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Share Awards which
would become vested solely as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with their terms unless otherwise determined by the
Company Board, not to become vested solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(d) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 3.06, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.06. Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Company Stock Options
promptly following the Effective Time and use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such
Company Stock Options for so long as such Company Stock Options remain
outstanding.

  

Section 3.07 _. Adjustments. _If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.

  

Section 3.08 _. Withholding Rights. _Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of any Tax law. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  

Section 3.09 _. Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to

     

   

such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated under this Article 3.

  

ARTICLE 4 
 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

  

Section 4.01 _. Articles of Incorporation. _The articles of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time as set forth in _Exhibit
B_ and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

  

Section 4.02 _. Bylaws. _The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

  

Section 4.03 _. Directors and Officers. _From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of the Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

generally and by general principles of equity.

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present, the CompanyÂ’s

any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities laws, (iv) such filings

provision of any Applicable Law or Order, (iii) require any consent or other

without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or
cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change

determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect would result,
any adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause (A) of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be taken into account.

  

Section 5.05 _. Capitalization. _(a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 90,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (of

grant, Company Stock Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate the grant of
Company Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of
material information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods specified in

principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
required under the 1934 Act with respect to such reports.

benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Company Employee Plan.

  

(f) There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering
any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

time after April 1, 2006 to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of)

outside legal counsel and of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii)
thereafter furnish to such Third Party non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in
the Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated as of August 15, 2006 between the
Company and Oracle Corporation (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ") and
containing additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply
with the terms of this Section 7.03 (a copy of which confidentiality
agreement shall be promptly (in all events within 24 hours) provided for
informational purposes only to Parent), (iii) following receipt of and on
account of such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or (iv) take any non-appealable, final action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take, but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), only if the Company Board determines in
good faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of outside legal
counsel to the Company, that it must take such action to comply with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall
prevent the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any
action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this
Section 7.03.

  

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in
no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that is seeking to make an Acquisition

the CompanyÂ’s business, present or future performance, financial condition

and its Representatives in its investigation; _provided_ that the Company
may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any Applicable Law
requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, or such disclosure would, based on the advice of such
partyÂ’s counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable to such
information. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be

condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement, and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) would be readily apparent to a reasonable person
who has read that reference and such representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable), without any independent knowledge on the part of
the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

  

Section 12.06 _. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. _(a) The provisions of

seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or

Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such

Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on

process on such party.

Section 12.11 _. Entire Agreement. _This Agreement, together with the Tender
and Support Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to their subject matter.

  

Section 12.12 _. Severability. _If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 12.13 _. Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall

required to accept for payment or pay for any tendered Company Shares, (ii)
may delay the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, any tendered
Company Shares, and (iii) may terminate or amend the Offer as to Company

expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended pursuant to Section 2.01(a) of
the Agreement): (A) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied; (B)
the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the

obtained; or (C) any of the following conditions exists:

  

(a) there shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding by any
Governmental Authority, or instituted or pending any action or proceeding
before any Governmental Authority by any other Person that has a reasonable
likelihood of success, (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay
materially or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the
making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of or payment for some or all
of the Company Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or seeking to obtain material damages in connection
therewith, (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit ParentÂ’s ownership or
operation (or that of its Affiliates) of all or any material portion of the
business, assets or products of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to compel
Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to
an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any material
portion of the business, assets or products of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly, to impose or confirm material
limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates effectively to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any Company Shares or
any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, including the right
to vote the Company Shares or the shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation acquired or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of ParentÂ’s
other Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders, (iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of ParentÂ’s other Affiliates of any Shares, or (v) which
would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially
delay the Offer or the Merger or that would reasonably be expected to
dilute materially the benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement; or  

   

(b) there shall have been any action taken, or any Applicable Law shall have
been proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to
the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Authority, other than the
application of the waiting period provisions of the HSR Act or any Foreign
Competition Law or any requirement for affirmative approval of a Governmental
Authority under any Foreign Competition Law, that, in the good faith judgment
of Parent is likely, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (a) above;
or

  

(c) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 5.05(a) or Section 5.05(c) shall not be true in all but _de minimis_
 respects when made or at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer as
if made at and as of such time (other than any such representation or
warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which need only to be true
in but _de minimis_ respects as of such specified date), (ii) any of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 2.02(a),
5.02, 5.04(i), 5.09(c), 5.24(a), 5.25 and 5.26, disregarding any materiality
or Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained in any such
representation or warranty, shall not be true in all material respects when
made or at any time prior to the consummation of the Offer as if made at and
as of such time (other than any such representation or warranty that is made
only as of a specified date, which need only to be true in all
material respects as of such specified date), or (iii) any of the other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement,
disregarding any materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty, shall not be
true in all respects when made or at any time prior to the consummation of
the Offer as if made at and as of such time (other than any such
representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which
need only to be true in all respects as of such specified date); _provided_
that the condition set forth in this paragraph (c)(iii) shall be deemed to
have been satisfied unless the individual or aggregate impact of the failure
to be true of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; _provided further_ that in determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect would result, any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties set forth in Sections 5.04(iii) and Section 5.04(iv) that
would cause an adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause (A) of the
definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be taken into account; or

  

(d) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respects any of its obligations under the Agreement; or

  

(e) any change or development shall have occurred following the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

  

(f) (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, or (ii) the
Company shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to

     

   

enter into, a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or Contract

(g) it shall have been publicly disclosed that any Third Party shall have
acquired beneficial ownership of more than 15% of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company (including the Company Shares), through the
acquisition of stock, the formation of a group or otherwise, or shall have
been granted any option, right or warrant, conditional or otherwise, to
acquire beneficial ownership of more than 15% of any class or series of
capital stock of the Company (including the Company Shares), other than
acquisitions for bona fide arbitrage purposes only; or

  

(h) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, may be
waived by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Subsidiary. The
failure by Parent or Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

  

The capitalized terms that are used in this _Annex I_  shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
