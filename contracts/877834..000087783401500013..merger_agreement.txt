Directors of ST-Sub and CENIT deem it in the best interests of ST-Sub and of
CENIT, respectively, and of their respective shareholders, that ST- Sub and
CENIT merge pursuant to this Agreement in a transaction that qualifies as a
reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (as amended, the "Code") (the "Merger");   WHEREAS, the Boards of
Directors of ST-Sub and CENIT have approved this Agreement and have directed
that this Agreement be submitted to their respective shareholders for
approval and adoption in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama,
the State of Delaware and the United States;   WHEREAS, SouthTrust, the sole
shareholder of ST-Sub, will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
shareholders of CENIT the consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, CENIT owns all
the issued and outstanding capital stock of CENIT Bank, a federally chartered
savings bank ("CENIT Bank"), and ST-Sub owns all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of SouthTrust Bank, an Alabama state banking
corporation ("ST-Bank"), and it is contemplated that, in connection with the
consummation of this Agreement and pursuant to the terms of a certain
Subsidiary Merger Agreement (the "Subsidiary Merger Agreement"), CENIT Bank
will be merged with and into ST-Bank (the "Subsidiary Merger");   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, the parties
agree that CENIT will be merged with and into ST-Sub and that the terms and
conditions of the Merger, the mode of carrying the Merger into
effect, including the manner of converting the shares of common stock of
CENIT,   1      par value $0.01 per share, into shares of common stock
of SouthTrust, par value of $2.50 per share, shall be as hereinafter set
forth.     ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER    Section 1.1 Consummation of
Merger; Closing Date. (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, CENIT shall be
merged with and into ST-Sub (which has heretofore and shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Merger") pursuant to the laws of the States of Alabama
and Delaware, and ST-Sub shall be the surviving corporation (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as "Surviving Corporation" when reference is made to
it after the Effective Time of the Merger (as defined below)). The Merger
shall become effective on the date and at the time on which a Certificate or
Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretaries of State of
Alabama and Delaware, unless a later date is specified in such Certificate or
Articles of Merger (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time of the Merger"). Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless

the Merger shall occur on the tenth (10th) business day following the later

that their approval is required by applicable law, approve the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The closing of the Merger (the

local time on the day that the Effective Time of the Merger occurs, or such
other date, time and place as the parties hereto may agree (the "Closing
Date"). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing there
shall be delivered to each of the parties hereto the opinions, certificates
and other documents and instruments required to be so delivered pursuant to
this Agreement.   Section 1.2 Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time of the
Merger, CENIT shall be merged with and into ST-Sub and the separate existence
of CENIT shall cease. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ST-Sub, as
in effect on the date hereof and as otherwise amended prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until further amended as provided therein and in
accordance with applicable law. The Surviving Corporation shall have all the
rights, privileges, immunities and powers and shall be subject to all the
duties and liabilities of a corporation organized under the laws of the State
of Alabama and shall thereupon and thereafter possess all other privileges,
immunities and franchises of a private, as well as of a public nature, of
each of the constituent corporations. All property (real, personal and mixed)
and all debts on whatever account, including subscriptions to shares, and all
choses in action, all and every other interest, of or belonging to or due to
each of the constituent corporations so merged shall be taken and deemed to
be transferred to and vested in the Surviving Corporation without further act
or deed. The title to any real estate, or any interest therein, vested in any
of the constituent corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by
reason of the Merger. The Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth be
responsible and liable for all the liabilities   2      and
obligations of each of the constituent corporations so merged and any
claim existing or action or proceeding pending by or against either of the
constituent corporations may be prosecuted as if the Merger had not taken
place or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted in its place. Neither
the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of any constituent
corporation shall be impaired by the Merger.   Section 1.3 Further
Assurances. From and after the Effective Time of the Merger, as and when
requested by the Surviving Corporation, the officers and directors of CENIT
last in office shall execute and deliver or cause to be executed and
delivered in the name of CENIT such deeds and other instruments and take or
cause to be taken such further or other actions as shall be necessary
in order to vest or perfect in or confirm of record or otherwise to the
Surviving Corporation title to and possession of all of the property,
interests, assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority of CENIT.   Section 1.4 Directors and Officers.   (a) From and
after the Effective Time of the Merger, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be those persons
serving as directors and officers of ST-Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, and such additional persons, in each case, as
SouthTrust, at or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall designate
in writing.   (b) From and after the Effective Time of the Merger and
ending no sooner than the second anniversary of the Effective Time of the
Merger, the directors of CENIT Bank, as of the date of this Agreement, shall
serve as directors of an advisory board of ST-Bank to be established by ST-
Bank and shall continue to receive compensation for service on that advisory
board equivalent to that which they would have received had they continued as
members of the Boards of Directors of CENIT Bank (including the additional
compensation paid to the Chairman of the Board of CENIT Bank).   (c) From
and after the Effective Time of the Merger and ending no sooner than December
31, 2002, ST-Bank shall continue in existence the advisory boards of CENIT
Bank in existence as of the date of this Agreement, subject to such changes
to the membership of those advisory boards as shall be appropriate in the
ordinary course of business. The members of these advisory boards shall
continue to be compensated for their service on the same basis as they were
compensated immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and ST-
Bank shall continue to make available to the members of these
advisory boards, and to the members of the advisory board established
pursuant to Section 1.4(b) above, incentive contests and programs on a
substantially similar basis to those made available by CENIT Bank prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger.   Section 1.5 Stock Option Agreement. As a
condition to the execution of this Agreement, CENIT is executing and
delivering to SouthTrust the Stock Option Agreement in the form as annexed
hereto as EXHIBIT 1.5.      3       ARTICLE 2   CONVERSION OF
CONSTITUENTS\' CAPITAL SHARES    Section 2.1 Manner of Conversion of CENIT
Shares. Subject to the provisions hereof, as of the Effective Time of the
Merger and by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part
of SouthTrust, ST-Sub, CENIT or the holder of any shares thereof, the shares
of the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:   (a) Each
share of capital stock of ST-Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger shall, after the Effective Time of the Merger,
remain outstanding and unchanged and thereafter shall constitute all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Each share of common stock of CENIT (the "CENIT
Shares") held by CENIT or by SouthTrust (or any of their subsidiaries), other
than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted,
shall be canceled and retired and no consideration shall be paid or delivered
in exchange therefor.   (c) Except with regard to CENIT Shares excluded in
(b) above, each CENIT Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger shall be converted into the right to receive 1.14 shares
of common stock of SouthTrust (and the rights associated therewith pursuant
to that certain Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of August 1,
2000 between SouthTrust and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company
(together, the "SouthTrust Shares")), and, subject to Section 2.2, all
outstanding certificates representing CENIT Shares shall thereafter represent
solely the right to receive SouthTrust Shares (such number of SouthTrust
Shares, as may be adjusted as provided herein, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Conversion Ratio"). The Conversion Ratio, including the aggregate
number of SouthTrust Shares issuable in the Merger, shall be subject to an
appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
dividend payable in SouthTrust Shares, reclassification or similar
distribution whereby SouthTrust issues SouthTrust Shares or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for SouthTrust Shares without receiving any
consideration in exchange therefor, provided that the record date of such
transaction is a date after the date of the Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, such that the aggregate value of
the consideration to be delivered by SouthTrust pursuant to this Agreement
remains unchanged. The Conversion Ratio set forth in this Section 2.1 gives
effect to the 2-for-1 stock split on SouthTrust Shares declared by the
SouthTrust Board of Directors on April 18, 2001, payable on May 11, 2001 to
shareholders of record on April 30, 2001.   Section 2.2 CENIT Stock Options
and Related Matters. (a) As of the Effective Time of the Merger, all rights
with respect to CENIT Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock
options ("CENIT Options") and the related Stock appreciation rights, if any
(the "CENIT SARs) granted by CENIT under CENIT Stock Option Plan and the
CENIT Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "CENIT Stock Option Plans"), which are
outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger, whether or not such CENIT
Options and CENIT SARs are then exercisable, shall, subject to this section,
be assumed by SouthTrust in accordance with the terms of the particular CENIT
Stock Option Plan under which such CENIT Options and CENIT SARs were issued
and the agreements by which such CENIT Options and CENIT SARs are evidenced,
except that from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, (i) SouthTrust
and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted for CENIT and the  
4      Committee of CENIT\'s Board of Directors administering the
particular CENIT Stock Option Plan, (ii) subject to Section 6.3(e), each
CENIT Option and CENIT SAR assumed by SouthTrust hereunder may be exercised
solely for SouthTrust Shares, (iii) the number of SouthTrust Shares subject
to such CENIT Option and CENIT SAR shall be equal to the number of CENIT
Shares subject to such CENIT Option and CENIT SARs immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger multiplied by the Conversion Ratio, and (iv) the
per share exercise price under each such CENIT Option and the related CENIT
SAR shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each
such CENIT Option by the Conversion Ratio and rounding up to the nearest
cent.   (b) At all times after the Effective Time of the Merger, SouthTrust
shall reserve for issuance such number of SouthTrust Shares as shall be
necessary to permit the exercise of any converted or substitute
CENIT Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger,
if it has not already done so, and to the extent CENIT shall have a
registration statement in effect or an obligation to file a registration
statement, SouthTrust shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the SouthTrust Shares
subject to converted or substitute CENIT Options and shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such converted or substitute CENIT Options remain
outstanding.   (c) The number of SouthTrust Shares subject to the
converted or substituted CENIT Options the exercise price thereof shall, from
and after the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of the Merger, be
subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of the occurrence of any
transaction described in Section 2.1(c) hereof if the record date with
respect to such transaction is on or after the date of this Agreement or
Effective Time of the Merger, respectively.   (d) Each CENIT Option which
is an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be
adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the Regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as to continue as an incentive stock option under
Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to constitute a modification,
extension, or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of
the Code. SouthTrust and CENIT agree to take all necessary steps to
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(d). Except as
otherwise provided herein, (i) the provisions of any CENIT Stock Option Plan
that provide for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of
the capital stock of CENIT shall be deleted as of the Effective Time of the
Merger and (ii) CENIT shall take all reasonable steps to ensure
that following the Effective Time of the Merger no holder of CENIT Options
shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of
CENIT.   (e) CENIT acknowledges that the holders of CENIT Options who may
become or be deemed under Rule 16b-3 to be executive officers or directors of
SouthTrust after the Effective Time of the Merger may be subject to
the short-swing sale restrictions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and regulations promulgated thereunder. With respect to those individuals, if
any, who subsequent to the Merger may be subject to the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, SouthTrust shall
administer any CENIT Option Plan assumed pursuant to this Section 2.2 (or the
SouthTrust Option Plan, if applicable) in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
("Exchange Act") to the extent necessary to preserve for such individuals the
benefits of Rule 16b-3 to the extent such benefits were available to them
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.   5       (f) At the
election of SouthTrust, CENIT shall procure from each holder of CENIT Options
who is an employee or director of CENIT or CENIT Bank, and shall deliver to
SouthTrust at the Closing, an executed acknowledgment of the treatment and
disposition of such holder\'s CENIT Options, pursuant to this Section
2.2.   Section 2.3 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, each holder of CENIT Shares converted pursuant to the
Merger, and each holder of CENIT Options assumed by SouthTrust pursuant to
this Agreement, who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction
of a SouthTrust Share (after taking into account all certificates delivered
by such holder), shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in
an amount equal to such fractional part of such SouthTrust Share, multiplied
by the market value of one SouthTrust Share at the Effective Time of the
Merger, in the case of shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger, or at the
date of exercise, in the case of CENIT Options to be exercised for SouthTrust
Shares. The market value of a SouthTrust Share at the Effective Time of the
Merger or the date of exercise, as the case may be, shall be the last sale
price of such SouthTrust Shares, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market
("NASDAQ") on the last business day preceding the Effective Time of the
Merger or the date of exercise, as the case may be, or, if the SouthTrust

CENIT Shares. If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, certificates are
properly presented to the Exchange Agent, such certificates shall be
exchanged for the consideration contemplated by this Agreement into which
CENIT Shares represented thereby were converted in the Merger.   (c) In the
event that any holder of record as of the Effective Time of the Merger of
CENIT Shares is unable to deliver the certificate which represents such
holder\'s CENIT Shares,   6      SouthTrust, in the absence of actual
notice that any CENIT Shares theretofore represented by any such certificate
have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, may, in its discretion, deliver
to such holder the consideration contemplated by this Agreement and the

SouthTrust harmless in respect of such stock  certificate(s); and   (iii)
Evidence to the satisfaction of SouthTrust that such  holder is the owner of
CENIT Shares theretofore  represented by each certificate claimed by such 
holder to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and  that such holder is the
person who would be entitled  to present each such certificate for exchange 
pursuant to this Agreement.   (d) In the event that the delivery of the
consideration contemplated by this Agreement and the amount of cash
representing fractional SouthTrust Shares are to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name any certificate representing CENIT Shares
surrendered is registered, such certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer), with the
signature(s) appropriately guaranteed, and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the delivery to a person other than the
registered holder of such certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of SouthTrust that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.   (e) No holder of CENIT Shares shall be entitled to receive
any dividends or distributions declared or made with respect to the
SouthTrust Shares with a record date before the Effective Time of the Merger.
Neither the consideration contemplated by this Agreement, any amount of cash
representing fractional SouthTrust Shares nor any dividend or other
distribution with respect to SouthTrust Shares where the record date thereof
is on or after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered certificate or certificates representing CENIT Shares,
and SouthTrust shall not be obligated to deliver any of the consideration
contemplated by this Agreement, any amount of cash representing fractional
SouthTrust Shares or any such dividend or other distribution with respect to
SouthTrust Shares until such holder shall surrender the certificate or
certificates representing CENIT Shares as provided for by the Agreement.
Subject to applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate or
certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate or
certificates then representing SouthTrust Shares issued in the Merger,
without interest at the time of such surrender, the
consideration contemplated by this Agreement, the amount of any cash

paid or delivered to the holders of CENIT Shares is not paid or delivered
within the time period specified by any applicable laws concerning abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws, and if such failure to pay or deliver such
consideration occurs or arises out of the fact that such property is not
claimed by the proper owner thereof, SouthTrust or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to dispose of any such consideration or other payments
in accordance with applicable laws concerning abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws. Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, none
of CENIT, SouthTrust, ST-Sub, the Exchange Agent, nor any other Person acting
on their behalf shall be liable to a holder of CENIT Shares for any amount

material respects, with the provisions of ERISA and the Code that are

has any material liability under any such plan that is not reflected in the

Subtitle B of title I of ERISA and any regulations thereunder, and "HIPAA"
means the provisions of the Code and ERISA as enacted by the Health Insurance

(which shall mean any transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA and not
exempt under Section 408 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan (i) which would result in the imposition, directly or
indirectly, of a material excise tax under Section 4975 of the Code or a
material civil penalty under Section 502(i) of ERISA, or (ii) the correction
of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of CENIT on a
consolidated basis; and no actions have occurred which could result in the
imposition of a penalty under any other section or provision of ERISA.  
(f) Except as described in Disclosure Schedule 3.12(f), neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) result in any material payment (including,
without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or any officer or employee of CENIT,
CENIT Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries under any Employee Benefit
Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable

participant in a multiemployer plan.    16       (h) There are no
actions, liens, suits or claims pending or, to the knowledge of CENIT, CENIT
Bank or any CENIT subsidiary, threatened (other than routine claims for
benefits) with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or against the assets of
any Employee Benefit Plan. No assets of CENIT, CENIT Bank or their respective
subsidiaries are subject to any lien under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section
412(n) of the Code.   (i) Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the
effect that it so qualifies and that its related trust is exempt from
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and each such Employee Benefit Plan
has been operated in accordance with its terms. No event has occurred or
circumstance exists that will or could give rise to a disqualification or
loss of tax-exempt status of any such plan or trust.   (j) No Employee
Benefit Plan is a multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section 413(c)

welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.   (k) Any
Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan, as defined in

of the Code is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded
plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred

subsidiaries beyond retirement or other termination of service (other than
coverage mandated by COBRA, the cost of which is fully paid by the current or

Schedule 3.12(l), any such plan may be amended or terminated at any time by
unilateral action of CENIT, CENIT Bank or their respective subsidiaries.

knowledge of CENIT, CENIT Bank or any CENIT subsidiary there is not, under
any of such leases or licenses, any existing default or event of default, or
any event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default or force majeure, or provide the basis for any other claim of
excusable delay or nonperformance, except for defaults which individually or
in the aggregate would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of
CENIT on a consolidated basis. Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule
3.13(b), CENIT, CENIT Bank and their respective subsidiaries have all right,
title and interest as a lessee under the terms of each lease or sublease,

permit SouthTrust or its agents full access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to the properties of CENIT, CENIT Bank and their

in which SouthTrust may have a reasonable interest, and CENIT, CENIT Bank and
their respective subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to
provide SouthTrust and its representatives access to the work papers of
CENIT\'s and CENIT subsidiaries\' accountants. CENIT, CENIT Bank and their
respective subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of any customer, would contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order or judgment, would violate any fiduciary obligations or
duties of the officers or directors of CENIT or CENIT Bank or would violate
any confidentiality agreement; provided that CENIT, CENIT Bank and their
respective subsidiaries shall cooperate with SouthTrust in seeking to obtain
Consents from appropriate parties under whose rights or authority access is
otherwise restricted. The foregoing rights granted to SouthTrust shall not,
whether or not and regardless of the extent to which the same are exercised,
affect the representations and warranties made in this Agreement by CENIT,
CENIT Bank and their respective subsidiaries.   (b) All information
furnished by the parties hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as the sole property of the party providing such information until the
consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby and, if such transaction shall
not occur, the party receiving the information shall return to the party
which furnished such information, all documents or other materials
containing, reflecting or referring to such information, shall use its best
efforts to keep confidential all such information, and shall not directly or
indirectly use such information for any competitive or other
commercial purposes. The obligation to keep such information confidential
shall continue for five (5) years from the date the proposed transactions are
abandoned but shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) the party
receiving the information was already in possession of prior to disclosure
thereof by the party furnishing the information, (B) was then available to
the public, or (C) became available to the public through no fault of the
party receiving the information; or (ii) disclosures pursuant to a legal
requirement or in accordance with an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or regulatory agency; provided, however, the party which is the
subject of any such legal requirement or order shall use its best efforts to
give the other party at least ten (10) business days prior notice thereof so
that such other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy, and, provided further, in the event such other party is unable to
obtain a protective order or other such remedy, the party that is subject to
such legal requirement shall furnish only that portion of such information
which it is advised by counsel is legally required and shall use best efforts
to ensure that confidential treatment will be accorded such information. Each
party hereto acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of their respective
obligations under this Section 5.3 would cause the other irreparable harm for
which there is no adequate remedy at law, and that, accordingly, each is
entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief for the enforcement thereof
in addition to damages or any other relief available at law.   Section 5.4
Approval of CENIT Shareholders. CENIT will take all steps necessary under
applicable laws to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders at such time as may be mutually agreed to by the parties for the
purpose of approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and for such other purposes consistent with the complete performance of this
Agreement as may be necessary or desirable. The Board of Directors of
CENIT    32      will recommend to its shareholders the approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and CENIT will use
its best efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by its shareholders of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors of CENIT will not be obligated to make any such
recommendation if it has been advised in writing by its counsel that to do so
could cause a breach of its fiduciary duties.   Section 5.5 No Other Bids.
For so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect, except with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, neither CENIT nor
any Affiliate thereof, nor any investment banker, attorney, accountant or
other representative (collectively, "representative") retained by CENIT,
CENIT Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries shall directly or
indirectly initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries
or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any "takeover proposal" (as defined below) by any other
party. Except to the extent CENIT\'s Board of Directors has been advised in
writing by counsel to such Board of Directors that the failure to do so could
cause a breach of its fiduciary duties, neither CENIT nor any Affiliate or
representative thereof shall enter into a discussion with or furnish to a
third party any non-public information or negotiate or enter into any
agreement or contract with respect to any takeover proposal, and shall direct
and use its reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates or representatives not
to engage in any of the foregoing. However, CENIT may communicate information
about such a takeover proposal to its shareholders if the Board of Directors
of CENIT has been advised in writing by its counsel that the failure to do so
could cause a breach of its fiduciary duties. CENIT shall promptly notify
SouthTrust orally and in writing in the event that it receives any inquiry or
proposal relating to any such transaction. CENIT shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated as of the date of this Agreement any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any other parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. As used in this
Section 5.5, "takeover proposal" shall mean any proposal for a merger or
other business combination involving CENIT, CENIT Bank or any of their
respective subsidiaries or for the acquisition of a significant equity
interest in CENIT, CENIT Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries or for
the acquisition of a significant portion of the assets or liabilities of
CENIT, CENIT Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries.   Section 5.6
Notice of Deadlines. No later than twenty (20) days following the execution
of this Agreement, CENIT will deliver to SouthTrust a schedule listing the
deadlines for extensions or terminations of any material leases, agreements
or licenses (including specifically real property leases and data processing

Affiliates. No later than thirty (30) days following the execution of this
Agreement, CENIT shall deliver to SouthTrust a letter identifying all persons
who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for approval to the
shareholders of CENIT, "affiliates" of CENIT for purposes of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, CENIT shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as an "affiliate"
in the letter referred to above to deliver to SouthTrust not later than
thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, a
written agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit 5.7 providing that
such Person will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of CENIT
Shares held by such Person, except as contemplated by such agreement or this
Agreement, and will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
SouthTrust Shares to be received by such Person upon consummation of the
Merger except in compliance with applicable provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933, and the rules and regulations thereunder. SouthTrust shall not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the   
33      Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for the
purposes of resale of SouthTrust Shares by such persons.   Section 5.8

Merger, whatever environmental audits as SouthTrust may request, which audit
shall be reasonably acceptable to and shall be conducted by a firm reasonably
acceptable to SouthTrust.   Section 5.10 Title Insurance. At the election of
SouthTrust, CENIT will, at its own expense, with respect to each parcel of
real property that CENIT or CENIT Bank owns, leases or subleases, procure and

and by such insurance company reasonably acceptable to SouthTrust, which
policy shall be free of all material exceptions to SouthTrust\'s reasonable
satisfaction.   Section 5.11 Surveys and Legal Descriptions. At the election
of SouthTrust, with respect to each parcel of real property as to which a
title insurance policy is to be procured pursuant to Section 5.10, CENIT, at

agree  that SouthTrust shall take appropriate steps to wind up the  ESOP and
distribute the assets of its trust in accordance with  terms and conditions

notwithstanding the Amendment to the CENIT Stock Option Plan Related Right
Agreements dated as of March 29, 2001, each holder of outstanding CENIT SARs
may elect to exercise such SARs for cash as of the Closing Date, pursuant to

and Bylaws of SouthTrust or the particular subsidiary for which they are
serving as officers, directors or employees and under such directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy as    39      SouthTrust may

CENIT\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy
(provided that SouthTrust may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous or (ii)with the consent of CENIT (given
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger) any other policy with respect to
claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger and covering persons who are currently covered by such

premium payments during the last five (5) years on CENIT\'s current policy,
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement multiplied by five (5) (the

procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, SouthTrust shall
use its reasonable efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of
director\'s and officer\'s liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount.   (d) If SouthTrust or any of its successors or
assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving person of such consolidation or merger, or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) seeking to restrain or
invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which, in the
case of (i) through (iii), and in the reasonable judgment of either

Agreement in the case of SouthTrust; or   (d) by the Board of Directors of

law at CENIT\'s shareholders\' meeting where the transactions were presented
to such shareholders for approval and voted upon; or   (f) by the Board of

Agreement under the applicable standard set forth in Section 8.1 of this
Agreement in this case of CENIT and Section 9.1 in the case of SouthTrust or

any claim against them by any person, including, without limitation, any
shareholder or former shareholder of either party. No representation or
