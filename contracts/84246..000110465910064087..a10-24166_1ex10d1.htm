Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Sellers shall
sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Acquiror, free and clear of

required by any applicable insurance or other Law and (c) ** ** a period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date.

(the " _Non-Disclosure Agreement_ "), between DSSC and RLI Insurance Company
are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality
obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall terminate. If, for any
reason, the Closing does not occur, the Non-Disclosure Agreement shall

(including for the purposes of competing with the other party or its
Affiliates), any written, oral or other information relating to or obtained
from the other party or its Affiliates (including with respect to the Acquiror
following the Closing, the Companies), except that the foregoing requirements
of this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall not apply to the extent that (i) any such
information is or becomes generally available to the public other than (A) in
the case of information relating to or obtained from the Acquiror or its
Affiliates, as a result of disclosure by either of the Sellers, their
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives and (B) in the case of
information relating to or obtained from the Sellers or their Affiliates, as a
result of disclosure by the Acquiror, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, (ii) any such information is required by
applicable Law, Governmental Order or a Governmental Authority to be disclosed
after prior notice that has been given to the Acquiror, (iii) any such

 



      
 

 



 

information is to be disclosed in connection with any Action, or (iv) any such
information was or becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis
and from a source (other than a party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or
Representative of such party) that is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, information relating to PJ6 and its
business shall be considered confidential information of Mr. Sirkin for
purposes of this _Section 6.4(b)_. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct
its Affiliates and Representatives having access to such information of such
obligation of confidentiality.

restriction or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate, would
result in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Burdensome

divest, operate in a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or limit,
any material assets, businesses or operations of the Companies, taken as a
whole, or the Acquiror, in each case, that would result in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a material negative effect on the assets

party shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required

of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless such party consults
with the other parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement and to

 **ARTICLE VII**

 

 ** **

 

 ** _EMPLOYEE MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 7.1 _Employment of Employees_.

 



 

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Companies shall continue to employ all of the
Employees other than the individuals listed on _Schedule 7.1(a)_. Neither the
Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall be
obligated, however, to continue to employ any Employee for any specific period
of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, for a period of no less
than one (1) year following the Closing Date, each Employee shall be entitled
to receive while in the employ of the Acquiror, any of the Companies or any of
their Affiliates at least the same base salary or hourly wages as was
disclosed by DSSC to the Acquiror as being provided to such Employee by the
Companies as of the date hereof, subject to any increase in salary or hourly
wages granted by DSSC following the date hereof in accordance with _Section
6.1(j)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall be
construed to confer a right to continued employment with the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies).

 



 

(c) Each Company shall remain bound by and retain exclusive responsibility on
and after the Closing Date for all individual employment, retention,
termination, severance, relocation/sign on bonus and other similar agreements,
all of which are listed in _Schedule 7.1(c)_ (collectively, " _Employee
Agreements_ ") between such Company and any current or former employee of such
Company.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided by Law, if the Closing occurs prior to
December 31, 2010, then, for at least the period between the Closing Date and
December 31, 2010, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to, (i) provide each Employee with an amount of vacation, sick and
personal paid leave (collectively, " _Paid Time Off_ ") that is no less than
the amount of unused Paid Time Off such Employee has accrued with the
Companies for the year during which the Closing occurs and (ii) provide Paid
Time Off benefits to the Employee that are comparable to those provided under
the applicable Paid Time Off program of the Acquiror or its Affiliates as in
effect on the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Acquiror
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Companies) to, honor all
obligations of the Companies for the unused Paid Time Off of the Employees
that has accrued during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. Upon
the later of the Closing Date and January 1, 2011, Acquiror will transition
Employees to its vacation, floating holiday, sick day and short term
disability programs, taking into account any service accrued while employed at
any Company to the extent the benefit is based on years of service. No
Employee shall carry over any prior year Paid Time Off after the effective
date of such transition, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise provided by Law, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Agreement, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, provide severance benefits to any Employee who is laid off or terminated
during the one-year (1-year) period following the Closing Date in accordance
with the Acquirors standard severance policies or, if applicable, such
Employees employment agreement with the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies), taking into account any service accrued while
employed at any Company (the amount of any such Employees severance payment
under the Acquirors standard severance policies or employment agreement, the
" _Standard Severance Amount_ "). In addition to the Standard Severance
Amount, so long as such Employee executes a general release releasing

 



      
 

 



 

the Companies and their Affiliates from any claims arising from or relating to
such Employees employment with any of the Company or any of their Affiliates,
the Acquiror shall pay to each Employee (other than Employees of Alaska
Frontier) who is laid off or terminated during the one-year (1-year) period
following the Closing Date a supplemental severance payment in an amount equal
to the positive difference between (i) an amount equal to one (1) year of such
Employees base salary or hourly wages as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date _minus_ (ii) the Standard Severance Amount with respect to such Employee
(the amount of any such Employees supplemental severance payment, the "
_Supplemental Severance Amount_ "). Any Supplemental Severance Amounts payable
by the Acquiror shall be paid to the applicable Employees in a lump sum on the
date that is six (6) months following the one year anniversary of the Closing
or if the Employee is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code
Section 409A, six (6) months following the Employees separation from service
(within the meaning of Code Section 409A), if later. Following the payment by
the Acquiror of all Supplemental Severance Amounts hereunder, the Acquiror
shall provide a written notice to Mr. Sirkin setting forth (x) a list of the
Employees (other than Employees of Alaska Frontier) who were laid off or
terminated during the one-year (1-year) period following the Closing Date and
(y) with respect to each such Employee, the Standard Severance Amount and
Supplemental Severance Amount paid by the Acquiror to such Employee. Promptly
following the receipt of such notice by Mr. Sirkin, Mr. Sirkin shall reimburse
the Acquiror for fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate severance payments
(Standard Severance Amount and Supplemental Severance Amount) actually paid to
each Employee (other than Employees of Alaska Frontier) in accordance with
this _Section 7.1(e)_ (net of any Tax benefits (determined using an assumed
rate of 35%) to be received by the Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the
Companies) as a result of providing the Standard Severance Amounts and the
Supplemental Severance Amounts); _provided_ that in no event shall Mr.
Sirkins reimbursement obligation under this _Section 7.1(e)_ with respect to
any Employee exceed the Supplemental Severance Amount paid by the Acquiror to
such Employee. No Employee terminated for cause shall be entitled to receive a
severance payment pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_, and any such
terminations for cause shall be handled by the Acquiror pursuant to its
policies and procedures generally applicable to its employees.

 



 

(f) The Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit the Employees
for service earned and, in the case of Employees of CBICs Phoenix East
branch, service credited with the Companies on the Closing Date, in addition
to service earned with the Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the
Companies) on or after the Closing Date, (i) to the extent that such service
is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of paid
time off, severance, layoff and similar benefits and for purposes of benefit
accruals (but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals
other than future benefit accruals) under any tax-qualified retirement plan
and non-qualified employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of the Employees on or after
the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent that such service is relevant for
purposes of calculating severance payments and (iii) for such additional
purposes as may be required by applicable Law.

 



 

(g) The Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, waive limitations
on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of the Employees and their
eligible dependents. The Acquiror shall, subject to applicable Law, provide
equitable adjustments to reflect deductibles paid under any Company group
health plan during any short plan year which occurs

 



      
 

 



 

as a result of transitioning employees from the group health plans of the
Company to the group health plans of the Acquiror or its Affiliates.

 



 

(h) The Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to,
permit each Employee who has one or more outstanding loans under a defined
contribution plan maintained by the Companies immediately prior to the Closing
Date and who receives an "eligible rollover distribution" within the meaning
of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code from such plan to elect to directly roll over
such distribution, including such outstanding plan loans, into a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by the Companies or the Acquiror or any
of its Affiliates.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, in no event shall any
Initial Transaction Bonus payments, Additional Transaction Bonus payments,
Supplemental Severance Amount payments or payments made to Employees as a
result of the termination of the Deferred Compensation Plans be taken into
account by the Acquiror or its Affiliates following the Closing for any
purpose under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, including for purposes of determining
eligibility or participation in any such employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Transaction Bonuses_.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Closing, DSSC shall (a) pay to each Employee
(other than the Employees set forth on _Schedule 7.2(a)_ and the Employees
of Alaska Frontier) a bonus in an amount equal to one (1) year of such
Employees then-current base salary or hourly wages or, if such Employees
hours were reduced by the Companies effective January 1, 2010, an amount equal
to one (1) year of such Employees base salary or hourly wages as of December
31, 2009, (b) pay each Employee listed on _Schedule 7.2_ a bonus in an amount
as set forth in _Schedule 7.2_ and (c) pay each Employee of Alaska Frontier a
bonus in an amount equal to $10,000 (each such bonus payment, an " _Initial
Transaction Bonus_ " and all such bonus payments, collectively, the " _Initial
Transaction Bonuses_ "); _provided_ , in each case, that such Employee has (i)
not violated any non-disclosure obligations to any of the Companies in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
or in the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) executed a general release agreement
releasing Mr. Sirkin, the ESOP and the Companies from (x) any legal claims
arising from or relating to such Employees employment with any of the
Companies and (y) any claim or right to any Capital Rights (other than through
the ESOP or pursuant to any plan or agreement listed in _Sections 3.1(a)(ii)_
or _3.1(a)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule). If an Employee resigns or is
terminated for cause prior to the Closing Date or does not satisfy the
conditions described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
then such Employee shall not be entitled to receive, and DSSC shall not be
required to pay to such Employee, any Initial Transaction Bonus, and the
Acquiror shall pay to Mr. Sirkin on the Closing Date, as additional purchase
price for the Shares sold by him, an amount equal to the portion of the
Initial Transaction Bonus Accrual attributable to the Initial Transaction
Bonus with respect to such Employee.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, within thirty (30) days following the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to, pay each Employee (other than the Employees listed
on _Schedule 7.2(a)_ and the Employees

 



      
 

 



 

of Alaska Frontier) a bonus in an amount equal to the Initial Transaction
Bonus such Employee received immediately prior to the Closing (each such bonus
payment, an " _Additional Transaction Bonus_ "). In addition, such Employees
as may be identified by the Acquiror may be approached by the Acquiror to
enter into employment agreements and non-compete arrangements with the
Acquiror, which arrangements may include in the Acquirors discretion
additional payments to facilitate continued employment, _provided_ , that the
Acquiror will be solely responsible for all such additional payments. If an
Employee resigns or is terminated for cause prior to the one year anniversary
of the Closing Date, then such Employee shall not be entitled to receive, and
the Acquiror shall not be required to pay to such Employee, any Additional
Transaction Bonus, and the Acquiror shall promptly pay to Mr. Sirkin, as
additional purchase price for the Shares sold by him, an amount equal to the
portion of the Additional Transaction Bonus Accrual attributable to the
Additional Transaction Bonus with respect to such Employee. If an Employees
employment is terminated without cause prior to the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date, then the Acquiror shall pay to such Employee the applicable
Additional Transaction Bonus promptly after such Employees termination date.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Plans._

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, the ESOP and
DSSCs 401(k) and group healthcare plans shall either be (i) terminated or
(ii) merged into the applicable employee benefit plans of the Acquiror or its
Affiliates. As soon as reasonably practicable after a reasonable transition
period following the Closing, each Employee shall be eligible to participate
in the employee benefit plans that are generally available to similarly
situated employees of the Acquiror and its Affiliates and shall participate on
the same basis as such other employees of the Acquiror. In the Acquirors
discretion, and subject to the limitations set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, the Acquiror may offer certain Employees the opportunity
to participate in compensation plans that are not generally available to all
employees of the Acquiror.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or required by
applicable Law, as of the Closing Date the Sellers shall have no further
responsibility under the Employee Plans.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Deferred Compensation_.

 



 

(a) DSSC shall terminate the Deferred Compensation Plans at or prior to the
Closing in accordance with applicable Law, and all unvested grants under the
Deferred Compensation Plans shall become vested immediately prior to such
termination, provided that all payments required to be made pursuant to the
Deferred Compensation Plans shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that so long as the Closing occurs
on or prior to December 31, 2010, such payments shall be made no later than
December 31, 2010.

 



 

(b) DSSC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, prior to the
Closing, any required reports to the Internal Revenue Service, withhold any
required taxes, reimburse each participant for any Tax liability incurred as a
result of the failure of any Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights Agreement
to comply with Section 409A of the Code (" _409A_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Non-Compliance_ ") and provide any such participant who incurs additional
Tax liability as a result of such 409A Non-Compliance with a gross-up payment
(collectively, the " _409A Remediation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the Closing, DSSC shall not make any such filings, withholdings,
reimbursements, or gross-up payments without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror. Following the Closing, to the extent that the 409A Remediation has
not been completed by DSSC prior to the Closing, the Acquiror shall take all
action necessary to reimburse each participant for any Tax liability incurred
as a result of the 409A Non-Compliance and provide any such participant who
incurs additional Tax liability as a result of such 409A Non-Compliance with a
gross-up payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the
Acquiror to take such action following the Closing shall only apply with
respect to the Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights Agreements identified
and disclosed to Acquiror prior to the date hereof as failing to comply with
Section 409A of the Code. Prior to December 31, 2010, DSSC shall (i) adopt an
amendment to the Amended and Restated Data and Staff Service Co. Executive Non-
Qualified Retirement Plan to bring such plan into compliance with Section 409A
of the Code pursuant to IRS Notice 2010-6 and (ii) adopt an amendment to all
Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights Agreements with respect to stock
appreciation rights that have not vested as of December 31, 2010, in a form
approved by the Acquiror, to bring such non-vested stock appreciation rights
into compliance with Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , that DSSC shall
not be deemed to have failed to amend a Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights
Agreement if an amendment to such Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights
Agreement is executed by DSSC and presented to the affected employee for the
employees signature in the event that the employee refuses to execute such
amendment. If any affected employee refuses to execute the amendment to a
Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights Agreement, Acquiror shall have no
responsibility to reimburse the employee for any Tax Liability incurred by the
employee resulting from the non-amended Stock Appreciation Rights/Stock Rights
Agreements failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code or to provide a
gross-up payment to the employee. On December 13, 2010, DSSC instructed Ernst
and Young LLP to send a letter to the Internal Revenue Service with a draft
closing agreement to resolve certain issues identified therein (a true and
correct copy of which was provided to Acquiror). DSSC shall (x) use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue having such agreement executed by
DSSC and the Internal Revenue Service in substantially the same form as was
provided to Acquiror, and (y) obtain the prior written consent of Acquiror
prior to entering into an agreement on terms different in any material respect
than those in the form provided to Acquiror.

 



 

Section 7.5 _2010 Year-End Bonus Payments_. The Acquiror agrees, to the extent
that such year-end bonus payments are not paid by the Companies prior to the
Closing, to pay to each Employee a year-end bonus for the annual period ending
December 31, 2010 in accordance with the Companies bonus policies as of the
date hereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that such bonuses shall be paid in
accordance with the Acquirors (or its Affiliates) general bonus payment
schedule applicable to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror, but in no
event later than February 28, 2011.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Medical Plan Participation._ The Acquiror shall take all action
necessary to ensure that all Persons (and their eligible dependents) who
participated in any medical plan maintained by the Companies immediately prior
to the Closing shall be eligible to continue participation in a medical plan
maintained by the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.7 _Impermissibility; Good Faith._ In the event that any provision
hereof is not permissible under any Law or practice, the parties agree that
they shall in good faith take such actions as are permissible under such Law
or practice to carry out to the fullest extent possible the purposes of such
provision.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Cooperation and Assistance._ The Acquiror shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, permit Employees to provide such assistance as is
reasonably requested by Mr. Sirkin in connection with any third-party
litigation filed against Mr. Sirkin or PJ6, to the extent that the provision
of such assistance does not unduly interfere with the Employees performance
of their job responsibilities and, in Mr. Sirkins opinion, (a) an Employee
has knowledge of relevant facts or issues, or (b) an Employees assistance is
reasonably necessary in respect of any such claim. Any request for assistance
by Mr. Sirkin pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall be made in writing to the
General Counsel of the Acquiror.

 



 

Section 7.9 _WARN Act._ The Acquiror shall not, and shall ensure that its
Affiliates (including on and after the Closing Date, the Companies) do not,
take any action or make any omission on or after the Closing that, in whole or
in part, results in liability for the Sellers pursuant to the Worker
Adjustment and Restraining Notification Act or any similar state or local
laws.

 



 

Section 7.10 _No Third Party Rights or Plan Amendments._ Regardless of
anything else contain in this _Article VII_, the parties do not intend for
this _Article VII_ to amend any employee benefit plans or arrangements or
create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto. No
Employee or other current or former employee of the Companies or the Acquiror,
or any of their respective Affiliates, or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any other person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled
to assert any claim hereunder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. Mr. Sirkin shall pay or reimburse the
Acquiror for one hundred percent (100%) of any real property transfer Tax,
sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including with
respect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.2(a)_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 ** _CONDITIONS TO CLOSING AND RELATED MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Conditions to Obligations of the Sellers_. The obligation of the
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
subject to the fulfillment or waiver by the Sellers in writing in their sole
discretion, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties; Covenants_. (i) Each of the
representations and warranties of the Acquiror contained in this Agreement
shall be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitations as to
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" set

 



      
 

 



 

forth therein) as of the date hereof and as of the Closing as if made on the
Closing Date (other than representations and warranties that are made as of
another date, which representations and warranties shall have been true and
correct as of such date); _provided_ , that for purposes of this condition,
such representations and warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct
unless the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct has had or would reasonably be expected to have an Acquiror Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) the covenants contained in this Agreement required to be
complied with by the Acquiror on or before the Closing shall have been
complied with in all material respects; and (iii) the Sellers shall have

Closing only as follows:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Acquiror;

 



 

(b) by the Sellers or the Acquiror if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or prior to June 30, 2011 (as may be extended in accordance with this _Section
10.1(b)_, the " _End Date_ ") or such later date as the parties may mutually
agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party
whose failure to take any action required to fulfill any of such partys
obligations under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the End Date may be extended by not more than
forty-five (45) days by Mr. Sirkin or the Acquiror by written notice to the
other parties if the Closing shall not have occurred as a result of the
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_ failing to have
been satisfied and the extending party reasonably believes in good faith that
the relevant approvals will be obtained during such extension period; or

 



 

(c) by the Sellers or the Acquiror in the event of the issuance of a final,
nonappealable Governmental Order restraining or prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Notice of Termination_. Any party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ shall give written notice of such

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
10.1_, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and there shall be no
liability on the part of any party to this Agreement, except as set forth in
_Section 6.4_, and this _Article X_ and _Article XII_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except as set forth in _Section 10.3(b)_, nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve the Sellers or the Acquiror from liability for (i)
failure to perform the obligations set forth in _Section 6.5_ or (ii) any
willful breach of this Agreement or willful failure to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by the Acquiror pursuant
to _Section 10.1(b)_, if the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or
prior to the End Date is a result of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.2(a)_ failing to have been satisfied,

 



       
 

 



 

Mr. Sirkin shall pay to the Acquiror, within five (5) Business Days of such
termination, an amount in cash equal to $2,000,000 by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Acquiror as
liquidated damages to compensate the Acquiror for the expense, time and effort
of engaging in the negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, which cash payment shall be the Acquirors sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any such termination, any breach of this
Agreement by the Sellers or DSSC and any failure by the Sellers or DSSC to
perform or comply with any of their covenants, agreements or obligations
hereunder prior to any such termination.

_Acquiror Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and reimburse any Acquiror
Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such Acquiror Indemnified Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty
made by Mr. Sirkin in _Article III_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the cumulative

Section 11.2 _Notification of Claims_.

 



 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ "), shall promptly notify the party or parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified
Party has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such

 



      
 

 



 

notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article XI_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) The Indemnified Party shall promptly and diligently defend and control any
Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall (i) allow the Indemnifying
Party and any insurance provider of the Indemnifying Party providing coverage
with respect to such Third Party Claim an opportunity to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense,

correspondence received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim promptly, but in no event greater than three (3) Business Days

Indemnifying Party with updates regarding any material developments with
respect to such Third Party Claim within two (2) Business Days of such
developments. The Sellers shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and
Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnified
Party shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any Third Party Claim without the consent of any Indemnifying
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(c) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this _Article XI_
for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim that
is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the prior consent of
such Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

Section 11.3 _Payment_. A claim for indemnification under this _Article XI_,
including any Action giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this
_Article XI_, and the liability for and amount of damages therefor, shall be
deemed to be " _finally determined_ " for purposes of this _Article XI_ when
Mr. Sirkin and the Acquiror, or, in the case of any Action, when the parties
to such Action, have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a
final non-appealable Governmental Order shall have been entered; _provided_ ,
that any costs or expenses in pursuing a Governmental Order shall be paid to
the prevailing party by the non-prevailing party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, for purposes of the immediately preceding proviso, the prevailing party
in such Action shall be the party whose final settlement offer, if applicable,
or prayer for relief contains terms that more closely resemble the terms of
the applicable final non-appealable Governmental Order. In the event a claim
for indemnification under this _Article XI_ shall have been finally
determined, the amount of such final determination shall be paid to the
Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party on demand by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by the
Indemnified Party.

tort, for any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained

any breach by the Sellers or DSSC of, or failure by the Sellers or DSSC to
perform or comply with, any covenants, agreements or obligations under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement that, by their terms, were to have been performed or complied with
at or prior to the Closing, shall be refusal to close the purchase and sale of
the Shares hereunder.

 



 

(b) following the Closing, (i) the indemnification provisions of _Article XI_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Acquiror, whether at law or in
equity, in contract or tort, for any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations or warranties in _Article III_ or in the certificate
delivered by Mr. Sirkin pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)(C)_ and (ii) the
Acquiror shall have no right to indemnification hereunder or other recourse
for any breach or inaccuracy of any other representation or warranty in this
Agreement or in any other certificate or instrument delivered hereunder or for
any breach by the Sellers or DSSC of, or failure by the Sellers or DSSC to
perform or comply with, any covenants, agreements or obligations under this
Agreement; and

 



 

(c) THE ACQUIROR AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL HAVE NO RECOURSE AGAINST MR. SIRKIN
FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT OR TORT, OTHER
THAN AS SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE XI_, AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS
TO WHICH MR. SIRKIN IS A PARTY, AND THE ACQUIROR AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT
SUE OR OTHERWISE INSTITUTE, COMMENCE OR PROSECUTE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
AGAINST MR. SIRKIN WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OR INACCURACY OF ANY OF THE
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES IN _ARTICLE IV_ OR IN THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED
BY DSSC PURSUANT TO _SECTION 9.2(a)(ii)(C)_ OR FOR ANY BREACH BY THE SELLERS
OR DSSC OF, OR FAILURE BY THE SELLERS OR DSSC TO PERFORM OR COMPLY WITH, ANY
COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each
indemnification obligation in this Agreement, (i) each such obligation shall
be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii) all Losses shall be net of any
third-party insurance proceeds which have been actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification within one (1) year after the expiration of the applicable
indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) in no event
shall the Indemnifying Party be liable to the Indemnified Party for any
punitive, consequential, special or indirect damages, including lost profits
(other than any such damages or lost profits actually paid to any unaffiliated
third party).

 



 

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of a matter for which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified
it pursuant to _Article VIII_ or this _Article XI_, such Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered
(after deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring
such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid
by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in
pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 11.5(a)_, an Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies based on any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of another party contained in
or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted by such Indemnified Party or any of
its representatives or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by any such Indemnified Party or its representatives, in each case, at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing, or such Indemnified Partys participation in the Closing.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable
steps to mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Reserves_. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 4.18_,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, the Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that neither Mr.
Sirkin nor DSSC makes any representation or warranty with respect to, and
nothing contained in this Agreement (including _Section 4.4_), any Ancillary
Agreement, or in any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby is intended
or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty (express or implied)

Agreements, or any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, with respect
to (a) the adequacy or sufficiency of the insurance reserves of CBIC, (b)

actuarial, statutory or other standard (other than the Actuarial Standards of

Section 12.4 _Public Announcements_. Except as may be required by Law
(including securities Laws) or applicable securities exchange rules, prior to
Closing none of the parties to this Agreement, nor any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives, shall make any public announcements in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and prior to any announcement the parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement. Prior
to Closing, unless such communication is otherwise made in accordance with a
communications plan or guidelines agreed by DSSC and the Acquiror, DSSC shall
permit the Acquiror to review in advance, and provide input with respect to
the content of, any communications with any customers, agents or employees of,
or other Persons with significant business relationships with, any of the
Companies concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.6 _Entire Agreement._ Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, other than the Non-Disclosure Agreement to the extent
not in conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of the Sellers, on
the one hand, and the Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with
respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

 



 

Section 12.7 _Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that the
Acquiror may assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to any
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
assignment shall release the Acquiror from any liability or obligation under
this Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 12.7_
shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by and against the parties hereto, their
heirs and estates, and their permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 12.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ Except as provided in _Article
XI_ with respect to Acquiror Indemnified Parties, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their permitted successors
and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.9 _Amendment._ No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, including any Exhibits or Schedules thereto, may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument making
specific reference hereto or thereto signed by all the parties to such
agreement. No consent from any Indemnified Party under _Article XI_ (other
than the parties to this Agreement) shall be required in order to amend this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.10 _Disclosure Schedule._ Except with respect to _Article III_,
(for which disclosure must be on a Section of the Disclosure Schedule
specifically referenced in _Article III_), any disclosure with respect to any
Section of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of
other Sections of this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure sets forth
facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be
reasonably apparent on its face to a reader of such disclosure. Matters
reflected in any Schedule or Section of the Disclosure Schedule or the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters required
by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Schedule or Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure
of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or Governmental Order
shall be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction._ Each of the Sellers, DSSC and the
Acquiror irrevocably and unconditionally:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) submits for itself and its property in any Action arising out of or
relating to the Transaction Agreements, the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of the
Transaction Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of the Transaction Agreements, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
state or federal court sitting in New York, New York, and appellate courts
having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing, and agrees that all
