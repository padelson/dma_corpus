3     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER,
dated as of September 30, 2005 (this "Agreement"), by and between CAVALRY
BANCORP, INC, a Tennessee corporation ("CAVB"), and PINNACLE FINANCIAL
PARTNERS, INC., a Tennessee corporation ("PNFP").   RECITALS:   WHEREAS,
the Boards of Directors of PNFP and CAVB have approved, and deem it advisable
and in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders
to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for
herein in which CAVB will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, merge with and into PNFP (the "Merger"), so that PNFP is
the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity
as the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger;   WHEREAS, the Boards of
Directors of PNFP and CAVB have each determined that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with, and in furtherance of,
their respective business strategies and goals;   WHEREAS, the parties
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the
Merger; and   WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER   1.1 The Merger.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the
"TBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined below), CAVB shall merge with and
into PNFP. PNFP shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Tennessee.
Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of CAVB
shall terminate.   (b) The parties may by mutual agreement at any time
change the method of effecting the combination of CAVB and PNFP including
without limitation the   1    provisions of this Article I, if and to
the extent they deem such change to be desirable, including without
limitation to provide for a merger of CAVB with and into a wholly-owned
subsidiary of PNFP; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount of Merger Consideration (as defined below) to be provided
to holders of CAVB Common Stock (as defined below) as provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of holders of CAVB Common
Stock as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (iii) materially
impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as
set forth in the articles of merger that shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Tennessee (the "Tennessee Secretary") on the Closing
Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger
becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger.   1.3 Effects of
the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 48-21-108 of the TBCA.   1.4 Conversion of CAVB
Common Stock . At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of CAVB, PNFP or the holder of any of the following
securities:   (a) Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock,
no par value per share, of CAVB (the "CAVB Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of
CAVB Common Stock owned by CAVB or PNFP (other than shares of CAVB Common
Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise
held in a fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties
(any such shares held in a fiduciary capacity by CAVB or PNFP, as the case
may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account Shares")) or shares of
CAVB Common Stock held on account of a debt previously contracted ("DPC
Shares"), shall be converted into the right to receive 0.95 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of PNFP
(the "PNFP Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration").   (b) All of the
shares of CAVB Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of CAVB
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive (i) a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of PNFP Common Stock (defined below), and (ii) cash in lieu of
fractional shares, into which the shares of CAVB Common Stock represented by
such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section
2.2(e). Certificates previously representing shares of CAVB Common Stock
shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of PNFP Common
Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2,
without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of PNFP Common Stock or CAVB Common Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio per
share payable pursuant to this Agreement.   2     (c) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares
of CAVB Capital Stock (as defined below) that are owned by CAVB or PNFP
(other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   1.5 PNFP Capital Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of PNFP Capital Stock (as defined below) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall remain issued and outstanding and
shall not be affected by the Merger.   1.6 Options and Other Stock-Based
Awards.   (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding
option to purchase shares of CAVB Common Stock (each a "CAVB Stock Option")
issued pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified in Section
4.11 of the CAVB Disclosure Schedule (the "CAVB Stock Plans") to any current
or former employee or director of, or consultant to, CAVB or any of its
Subsidiaries, as defined below, shall be assumed by PNFP and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase a number of shares of PNFP
Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) (an "Assumed Stock Option")
at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to
the terms of the CAVB Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the options
thereunder):   (i) The number of shares of PNFP Common Stock to be subject
to the Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of CAVB Common Stock subject to the CAVB Stock Option and the Exchange
Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of PNFP Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share; and  
(ii) The exercise price per share of PNFP Common Stock under the
Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of CAVB
Common Stock under the CAVB Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio,
provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole
cent.  In the case of any CAVB Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the
conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Assumed Stock
Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including
expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were applicable to the
corresponding CAVB Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration of
vesting thereof, provided for in the CAVB Stock Plans or other CAVB Benefit
Plan, as defined below, or in any award agreement thereunder by reason of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); provided, however,
that references to CAVB shall be deemed to be references to PNFP.   (b)
PNFP has taken all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of PNFP Common Stock upon the exercise of
the Assumed Stock Options. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date (and in no event more than five business days after the Closing Date),
PNFP shall file a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-
effective   3    amendment to a previously filed registration statement
under the Securities Act (defined below) with respect to the issuance of the
shares of PNFP Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and shall
use its reasonable efforts consistent with customary industry standards to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such equity awards remain outstanding.  
1.7 Charter. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, the Charter of PNFP, as amended (the "PNFP Articles"),
shall be the Charter of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.   1.8 Bylaws. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of PNFP shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law.   1.9 Tax Consequences. It is intended that
the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.  
1.10 Certain Post-Closing Matters.   (a) Board Composition. As of the
Effective Time, and continuing for a period consistent with the 3 year
staggered terms of directors of PNFP to which they will be added following
the Effective Time, Ed C. Loughry, Jr. and two other Current CAVB Directors,
as defined below, shall be appointed to and shall serve on the Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation. For purposes of this Section 1.10,
the term "Current CAVB Directors" shall mean those members of the CAVB Board
of Directors immediately prior to the public announcement of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Procedure for Appointing Current CAVB
Directors to Surviving Corporation\'s Board of Directors. Within thirty (30)
days after the date of this Agreement, the nominating and corporate
governance committee of the Board of Directors of CAVB shall submit the names
of Ed C. Loughry, Jr. and two other Current CAVB Directors to the nominating
and corporate governance committee of PNFP for consideration of nomination to
fill three vacancies on the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time. The nominating and corporate governance committee
of PNFP\'s Board of Directors shall nominate such persons to fill such
vacancies. The Board of Directors of PNFP shall promptly meet to consider the
appointment of such persons to fill such vacancies and shall appoint such
persons at such meeting if such persons, other than Ed C. Loughry, Jr., are
reasonably acceptable candidates to serve on the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation. In the event the nominating and corporate governance
committee or the Board of Directors of PNFP objects to a nominee, other than
Ed C. Loughry, Jr., the nominating and corporate governance committee of
CAVB\'s Board of Directors shall propose additional nominees
for consideration until a reasonably acceptable member is found.   (c)
Officers of Surviving Corporation. The current officers of PNFP
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation.   4    
(d) Survival/Adoption of Commitments. The commitments set forth in
this Section 1.10 shall survive the Effective Time as reflected in a
formal resolution of the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation to
be reflected in the minutes of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time of the Merger.   1.11 Headquarters of Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, the location of the headquarters and
principal executive offices of the Surviving Corporation shall be that of the
headquarters and principal executive offices of PNFP as of the date of this
Agreement.   ARTICLE II.  DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION   2.1 Deposit
of Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, PNFP shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to each of CAVB and PNFP (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, certificates representing the shares of PNFP Common Stock and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of
PNFP Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(e)
in exchange for outstanding shares of CAVB Common Stock.   2.2 Delivery of
Merger Consideration.   (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later
than five business days, after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of
transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of PNFP
Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares
of CAVB Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation, together with such properly completed and duly executed letter
of transmittal as the Exchange Agent may reasonable require, the holder of
such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of PNFP Common Stock to which such holder of CAVB Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check
representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any cash or on any unpaid dividends and
distributions payable to holders of Certificates.   (b) No dividends or
other distributions declared with respect to PNFP Common Stock shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article   5    II,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of PNFP Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.   (c) If any certificate representing shares of PNFP
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of PNFP Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of CAVB of the shares of CAVB Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of PNFP Common Stock and cash
for fractional shares as provided in this Article II.   (e) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of PNFP Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with
respect to PNFP Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of PNFP. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, PNFP shall pay to each
former shareholder of CAVB who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the
average of the closing-sale prices of PNFP Common Stock on the securities
market or stock exchange in which the PNFP Common Stock principally trades,
as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately
preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PNFP
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4.   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of CAVB as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be paid to PNFP. Any former shareholders of CAVB who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to PNFP for payment of the shares of PNFP Common Stock and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the PNFP
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of CAVB Common Stock such
shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of CAVB,
PNFP, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of CAVB Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.   6     (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by PNFP, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as PNFP may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of PNFP Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.   ARTICLE III.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PNFP  
Except as disclosed in (a) the PNFP Reports (defined below) filed prior
to the date hereof or (b) the disclosure schedule (the "PNFP Disclosure
Schedule") delivered by PNFP to CAVB prior to the execution of this Agreement
(which schedule sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which
is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or
more representations or warranties contained in this Article III or to one or
more of PNFP\'s covenants contained in Article V, provided, however,
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such
item is required to be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the
standard established by Section 9.2, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on
PNFP), PNFP hereby represents and warrants to CAVB as follows:   3.1
Corporate Organization.   (a) PNFP is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Tennessee. PNFP
has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on PNFP. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to CAVB, PNFP or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or which might have a financial cost to PNFP
after the Merger of at least $500,000 taking into account, for example
with respect to Regulatory Agreements, the aggregate costs to PNFP of
compliance, personnel costs, appeals, fines, legal, accounting, or consulting
fees, or restrictions on future expansion, or (ii) the ability of such party
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however,
that with respect to clause (i), the following shall not be deemed to have a
Material Adverse Effect: any change or event caused by or resulting from (A)
changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates or other
economic or monetary conditions in the United States or elsewhere, (B)
changes in United States or foreign securities markets, including changes in
price levels or trading   7   volumes, (C) changes or events, after the
date hereof, affecting the financial services industry generally and not
specifically relating to PNFP or CAVB or their respective Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, (D) changes, after the date hereof, in generally accepted
accounting principles or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to
banks or savings associations and their holding companies generally, (E)
changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by any Governmental Entity (as
defined below), (F) actions or omissions of PNFP or CAVB taken with the prior
written consent of the other or required hereunder, (G) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement thereof, or (H) any
outbreak of major hostilities in which the United States is involved or any
act of terrorism within the United States or directed against its facilities
or citizens wherever located; and provided, further, that in no event shall a
change in the trading prices of a party\'s capital stock, by itself, be
considered material or constitute a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) PNFP is
a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended (the "BHC Act"). True and complete copies of the PNFP Articles and
Bylaws of PNFP, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by PNFP to CAVB.   (c) Each PNFP Subsidiary
(i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in good standing
in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it
to be so qualified and in which the failure to be so qualified would have a
Material Adverse Effect on PNFP and (iii) has all requisite corporate or
other power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except to the extent that the failure
to have such power or authority will not result in a Material Adverse Effect
on PNFP. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when used with
respect to any party means any bank, savings bank, corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for financial reporting
purposes under GAAP.   3.2 Capitalization.   8     (a) The authorized
capital stock of PNFP consists of forty million (40,000,000) shares of PNFP
Common Stock, of which, as of September 30, 2005, 8,424,217 shares were
issued and outstanding, and ten million (10,000,000) shares of preferred
stock, no par value per share (together with the PNFP Common Stock, the "PNFP
Capital Stock"), of which, as of September 30, 2005, no shares were issued
and outstanding. As of the date hereof, no shares of PNFP Capital Stock were
reserved for issuance except for 2,133,489 shares of PNFP Common Stock
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of PNFP
Common Stock (each a "PNFP Stock Option") pursuant to the equity-
based compensation plans of PNFP (the "PNFP Stock Plans") as identified in
Section 3.2(a) of the PNFP Disclosure Schedule. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of PNFP Capital Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.  
(b) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right
to vote on any matters on which shareholders may vote ("Voting Debt") of PNFP
are issued or outstanding. Since June 30, 2005, PNFP has not issued any
shares of PNFP Capital Stock or any securities convertible into or

changes in shareholders\' equity, cash flows and financial position of PNFP
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth, subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments in the case of unaudited statements; each of such statements

respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) has been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods

other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or
regulatory investigations of any nature against PNFP or any of its
Subsidiaries or challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as to which, in any such case, there is a
reasonable probability of an   12    adverse determination and which, if
adversely determined, will be reasonably likely to, either individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP.   (b) There is no
injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction (other than
those that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or banks)
imposed upon PNFP, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of PNFP or any of

Returns.   (a) Each of PNFP and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all federal,
state, foreign and local information returns and Tax returns required to be
filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such returns being

provision for the payment of all Taxes that have been incurred or are due or
claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing
authorities other than (i) Taxes or other governmental charges that are not
yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith or have not been finally
determined and have been adequately reserved against under GAAP, or (ii)
information returns, Tax returns or Taxes as to which the failure to file,

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP. The
federal income Tax returns of PNFP and its Subsidiaries to the knowledge of
PNFP have not been examined by the IRS. There are no material disputes
pending, or to the knowledge of PNFP, claims asserted, for Taxes or
assessments upon PNFP or any of its Subsidiaries for which PNFP does not have

its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation
or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement
or arrangement exclusively between or among PNFP and its Subsidiaries).

a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.   (b) As

Plans and certain related documents, including, but not limited to, (i) the
actuarial report for such PNFP Benefit Plan (if applicable) for each of the
last two years, and (ii) the most recent determination letter from the IRS

Material Adverse Effect on PNFP, (i) each of the PNFP Benefit Plans has been
operated and administered in all material respects in compliance with the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and the

of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the assets of
such PNFP Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (iv) no PNFP
Benefit Plan provides benefits, including, without limitation, death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees or directors of PNFP or its Subsidiaries beyond their retirement or

or former employee or director (or his beneficiary), (v) no material
liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by PNFP, its Subsidiaries
or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, all of which together
with PNFP, would be deemed a "single employer" under Section 4001 of ERISA (a

exists that presents a material risk to PNFP, its Subsidiaries or any PNFP
ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material liability thereunder, (vi) no PNFP

person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in a transaction in connection

ERISA or a material Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code,
and (ix) to the knowledge of PNFP there are no pending, threatened or
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of
or against any of the PNFP Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto.  
(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) result (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional acts or events) in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness
or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of PNFP or any of
its   14    affiliates from PNFP or any of its affiliates under any PNFP
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any PNFP Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of

PNFP has filed all required reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (the "PNFP Reports"). As
of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
filing), the PNFP Reports complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such PNFP
Reports, and none of the PNFP Reports when filed contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   3.13
Compliance with Applicable Law.   (a) PNFP and each of its Subsidiaries hold
all material licenses, franchises, permits, patents, trademarks and
authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all material
respects with and are not in default in any material respect under any,
applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy, agreement and/or
guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to PNFP or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise,
permit or authorization or such noncompliance or default will not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP.  
(b) Except as will not have, either individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP, PNFP and each of its Subsidiaries have
properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,

material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary
account.   3.14 Certain Contracts.   (a) Except as disclosed in Section

ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which,
upon the consummation or shareholder approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance
pay or otherwise) becoming due from PNFP, CAVB, the Surviving Corporation, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof,
(iii) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of
this Agreement that has not been filed or incorporated by reference in the
PNFP Reports, (iv) which materially restricts the conduct of any line of
business by PNFP or upon consummation of the Merger will materially restrict
the ability of the Surviving Corporation to engage in any line of business in
which a bank holding company may lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor
union or guild (including any collective bargaining agreement) or (vi)
(including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted
stock plan or stock purchase plan) any of the benefits of which will be
increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any shareholder approval or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding of the type described in this Section 3.14(a), whether or not
set forth in the PNFP Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "PNFP
Contract", and neither PNFP nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any violation of the above by any of the other
parties thereto which will have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on PNFP.   (b) (i) Each PNFP Contract is valid and binding
on PNFP or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and
effect, (ii) PNFP and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each
PNFP Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP, and (iii) no
event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time
or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of PNFP or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such PNFP Contract, except where such default
which will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on PNFP.   3.15 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither PNFP nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order
issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been since January 1, 2000, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or
since January 1, 2000, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of,
any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts
in any material respect the conduct of its business, would restrict the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that in
any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its
management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the PNFP
Disclosure Schedule, a "PNFP Regulatory Agreement"), nor to the knowledge of
PNFP has PNFP or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2001,
by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing or requesting any such PNFP Regulatory Agreement.   16     
3.16 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not
be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on PNFP, (a) all interest rate swaps, caps, floors
and option agreements and other interest rate risk management arrangements,
whether entered into for the account of PNFP or for the account of a customer
of PNFP or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the ordinary course
of business and, to PNFP\'s knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory
Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at
the time, and are legal, valid and binding obligations of PNFP or one of its
Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and are in full force and effect; (b) PNFP and each of its
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and (c) to PNFP\'s knowledge, there are no material
breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any
party thereunder.   3.17 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those
liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of PNFP included in the PNFP Form 10-Q and for liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since June 30, 2005, neither PNFP nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred
any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either individually or
in the aggregate, has had or will have, a Material Adverse Effect on
PNFP.   3.18 Insurance. PNFP and its Subsidiaries have in effect insurance
coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in respect of
amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably adequate
coverage against all risks insured against by bank holding companies
comparable in size and operations to PNFP and its Subsidiaries.   3.19
Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private
environmental investigations or remediation activities or governmental
investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably
result in the imposition, on PNFP of any liability or obligation arising
under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute,
regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
("CERCLA"), pending or, to the knowledge of PNFP, threatened against PNFP,
which liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP. To the knowledge of PNFP, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on PNFP.
PNFP is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to
the foregoing that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on PNFP.   3.20 State Takeover Laws. The Board of
Directors of PNFP has approved the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for purposes of Sections 48-103-101 through 48-103-505 of the TBCA,
if applicable to PNFP, such that the provisions   17     of such
sections of the TBCA will not apply to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   3.21 Reorganization. As
of the date of this Agreement, PNFP is not aware of any fact or circumstance
that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   3.22
Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
PNFP for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at
the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii)
the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at
the times of the meetings of shareholders to be held in connection with the
Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty
is made by PNFP with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by CAVB for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement.   3.23 Internal Controls. The
records, systems, controls, data and information of PNFP and its Subsidiaries
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of PNFP or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence. As and to the extent described in the PNFP Reports filed with the
SEC prior to the date hereof, PNFP and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP. PNFP (i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to PNFP, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of PNFP by others within those
entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to PNFP\'s independent registered public accounting firm
and the audit committee of PNFP\'s Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect PNFP\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in PNFP\'s internal
control over financial reporting. PNFP has made available to CAVB a summary
of any such disclosure made by management to PNFP\'s auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2002. PNFP is in full compliance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   18     3.24 Opinion of PNFP
Financial Advisor. PNFP has received the opinion of its financial advisor,
Raymond James and Associates, Inc., dated the date of this Agreement, to the
effect that the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view,
to PNFP and the holders of PNFP Common Stock.   ARTICLE IV. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF CAVB   Except as disclosed in (a) the
CAVB Reports (defined below) filed prior to the date hereof or (b) the
disclosure schedule (the "CAVB Disclosure Schedule") delivered by CAVB to
PNFP prior to the execution of this Agreement (which schedule sets forth,

either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in this Article IV or to one or more of CAVB\'s
covenants contained in Article V, provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to
be set forth in such schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty
being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard established by Section
9.2, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on CAVB), CAVB hereby represents and warrants to PNFP
as follows:   4.1 Corporate Organization.   (a) CAVB is a corporation

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the

1, 2000 with the Regulatory Agencies, and all other reports and statements
required to be filed by them since January 1, 2000, including, without
limitation, any report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the

consolidated statements of income and changes in shareholders\' equity and
cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 through 2004,
inclusive as reported in CAVB\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal

referred to in this Section 4.6 (including the related notes, where
applicable) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, changes in shareholders\' equity, cash flows   22    and
financial position of CAVB and its Subsidiaries for the respective

published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of
such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been
prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except in each case as indicated in such

in Section 4.9(a) of the CAVB Disclosure Schedule, neither CAVB nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best
of CAVB\'s knowledge, threatened legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries or challenging the
validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
to which, in any such case, there is a reasonable probability of an adverse
determination and which, if adversely determined, will be reasonably likely
to, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on CAVB.   (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or
regulatory restriction (other than those that apply to similarly situated
bank holding companies or banks) imposed upon CAVB, any of its Subsidiaries
or the assets of CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries that has had or will have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CAVB.   4.10 Taxes and Tax Returns. Each of CAVB and its Subsidiaries has
duly filed all federal, state, foreign and local information returns and Tax
returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement

incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign
or local taxing   23     authorities other than (i) Taxes or other
governmental charges that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in
good faith or have not been finally determined and have been adequately
reserved against under GAAP, or (ii) information returns, Tax returns or
Taxes as to which the failure to file, pay or make provision for is not
reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CAVB. As of the date of this Agreement, the IRS is
examining the 2003 combined return of CAVB and its Subsidiaries. Other than
such ongoing examination, the federal income Tax returns of CAVB and its
Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of CAVB, have not been examined by the IRS.
There are no material disputes pending, or to the knowledge of CAVB, claims
asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries for
which CAVB does not have adequate reserves. Neither CAVB nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement
or arrangement exclusively between or among CAVB and its Subsidiaries).

determination letter from the IRS (if applicable) for such CAVB Benefit

material respects in compliance with ERISA and the Code, (ii) each of the
CAVB Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and has received a favorable determination from the IRS

will adversely affect the qualified status of any such CAVB Benefit Plan,
(iii) with respect to each CAVB Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of
ERISA, the present value of accrued benefits under such CAVB Benefit Plan,
based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most

the current or former employee or director (or his beneficiary), (v) no
material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by CAVB, its
Subsidiaries or any trade or business, whether or not incorporated, all of
which together with CAVB, would be deemed a "single employer" under Section

and no condition exists that presents a material risk to CAVB, its
Subsidiaries or any CAVB ERISA Affiliate of incurring a material liability
thereunder, (vi) no CAVB Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), (vii) all contributions

to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, and (ix) to the knowledge of CAVB there
are no pending, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the CAVB Benefit Plans or

(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code),
forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any
employee of CAVB or any of its affiliates from CAVB or any of its affiliates
under any CAVB Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any CAVB Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits that
will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on CAVB.   4.12 SEC Reports. CAVB has previously made available to PNFP an
accurate and complete copy of each (a) final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed since
January 1, 2000 by CAVB with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the

material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such CAVB Reports, and none of the CAVB Reports when filed
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

not misleading.   25     4.13 Compliance with Applicable Law.   (a)
CAVB and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises,
permits, patents, trademarks and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have
complied in all material respects with, and are not in default in
any material respect under, any applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy, agreement and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity
relating to CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold
such license, franchise, permit or authorization or such noncompliance or
default will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on CAVB.   (b) Except as will not have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CAVB, CAVB and each of its
Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent,
custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment

of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the consummation or
shareholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from
CAVB, PNFP, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement that has not been
filed or incorporated by reference in the CAVB Reports, (iv) which materially
restricts the conduct of any line of business by CAVB or upon consummation of
the Merger will materially restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation
to engage in any line of business in which a bank holding company may
lawfully engage, (v) with or to a labor union or guild (including
any collective bargaining agreement) or (vi) (including any stock option
plan, stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase
plan) any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the
benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any shareholder
approval or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on
the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. CAVB has
previously made available to PNFP true and correct copies of all employment
and deferred compensation agreements which are in writing and to which CAVB
is a party. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the
type described in this Section 4.14(a), whether or not set forth in the CAVB
Disclosure Schedule, is   26    referred to herein as a "CAVB Contract",
and neither CAVB nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice
of, any violation of the above by any of the other parties thereto which will
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CAVB.   (b) (i) Each CAVB Contract is valid and binding on CAVB or any of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, (ii) CAVB and
each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each CAVB Contract,
except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate,
will not have a Material Adverse Effect on CAVB, and (iii) no event or
condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both,
will constitute, a material default on the part of CAVB or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such CAVB Contract, except where such default which
will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on CAVB.   4.15 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Neither CAVB nor any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by,
or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum
of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been since January 1, 2000, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or
since January 1, 2000, has adopted any board resolutions at the request of
any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts
in any material respect the conduct of its business, would restrict the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that in
any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its
management or its business (each, whether or not set forth in the CAVB
Disclosure Schedule, a "CAVB Regulatory Agreement"), nor, to the knowledge of
CAVB, has CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2000,
by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing or requesting any such CAVB Regulatory Agreement.   4.16 Interest
Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not be reasonably likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CAVB, (a) all interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and
other interest rate risk management arrangements, whether entered into for
the account of CAVB, one of its Subsidiaries, or for the account of
a customer of CAVB or one of its Subsidiaries, were entered into in the
ordinary course of business and, to CAVB\'s knowledge, in accordance with
prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and policies of
any Regulatory Authority and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible at the time, and are legal, valid and binding obligations of CAVB
or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable in accordance with their terms (except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability
of equitable remedies), and are in full force and effect; (b) CAVB and each
of its Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and (c) to CAVB\'s knowledge, there are no material
breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any
party thereunder.   4.17 Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for those
liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of CAVB included in the CAVB Form 10-Q and for liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of   27    business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2005, neither CAVB nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) that, either
individually or in the aggregate, has had or will have, a Material Adverse
Effect on CAVB.   4.18 Insurance. CAVB and its Subsidiaries have in effect
insurance coverage with reputable insurers or are self-insured, which in
respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, constitutes reasonably
adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by bank
holding companies and their subsidiaries comparable in size and operations to
CAVB and its Subsidiaries.   4.19 Environmental Liability. There are no
legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes
of action, private environmental investigations or remediation activities or
governmental investigations of any nature seeking to impose, or that could
reasonably result in the imposition, on CAVB of any liability or obligation
arising under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental
statute, regulation or ordinance including, without limitation, CERCLA,
pending or, to the knowledge of CAVB, threatened against CAVB, which
liability or obligation will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on CAVB. To the knowledge of CAVB, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that will, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on CAVB.
CAVB is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter
or memorandum by or with any court, governmental authority, regulatory agency
or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the
foregoing that will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on CAVB.   4.20 State Takeover Laws. The Board of Directors
of CAVB has approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for
purposes of Sections 48-103-101 through 48-103-505 of the TBCA, if applicable
to CAVB, such that the provisions of such sections of the TCBA will not apply
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.   4.21 Reorganization. As of the date of this Agreement, CAVB is
not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.   4.22 Information Supplied. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by CAVB for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
the SEC and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date
of mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meetings of shareholders
to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by CAVB  
28    with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by PNFP for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement.   4.23 Internal Controls. The
records, systems, controls, data and information of CAVB and its Subsidiaries
are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of CAVB or its
Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect on
the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence. As and to the extent described in the CAVB Reports filed with the
SEC prior to the date hereof, CAVB and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP. CAVB (i) has designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to CAVB, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of CAVB by others within those
entities, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to CAVB\'s independent registered public accounting firm
and the audit committee of CAVB\'s Board of Directors (x) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect CAVB\'s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in CAVB\'s internal
control over financial reporting.. CAVB has made available to PNFP a summary
of any such disclosure made by management to PNFP\'s auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2002. CAVB has initiated its process of compliance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and expects to be in full
compliance therewith by the mandated compliance date.   4.24 Opinion of CAVB
Financial Advisor. CAVB has received the opinion of its financial advisor,
Hovde Financial LLC dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that the
consideration received by the holders of CAVB Common Stock is fair, from a
financial point of view, to CAVB and the holders of CAVB Common Stock.

Regulatory Matters.   (a) CAVB and PNFP shall promptly prepare and file with
the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement and PNFP shall promptly prepare and file
with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of CAVB and PNFP shall use their reasonable
best efforts in consultation with their respective legal counsel to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and CAVB and PNFP shall thereafter mail or
deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. PNFP
shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and CAVB shall furnish all
information concerning CAVB and the holders of CAVB Capital Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. If at any time prior
to or after the Effective Time any information relating to either of
the parties, or their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should
be discovered by either party which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
so that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
hereto   33    and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations,
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of PNFP and
CAVB.   (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. CAVB and PNFP shall have
the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to PNFP or CAVB, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
herein.   (c) Each of CAVB and PNFP shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form
S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of CAVB, PNFP or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Each of CAVB and PNFP shall promptly
advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental
Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval
(as defined below) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.   (e) PNFP and CAVB shall promptly
furnish each other with copies of written communications received by PNFP and
CAVB, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from, or
delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental Entity in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.2 Access to
Information.   (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of CAVB and PNFP, for the
purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of the other and
preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the officers, employees,   34    accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other party, access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of
CAVB and PNFP shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws (other than reports or documents which CAVB or PNFP, as
the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as such party may reasonably request. Neither CAVB nor PNFP nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of CAVB\'s or PNFP\'s, as the case may be, customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.   (b) Each of PNFP and CAVB
agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 (as well as any other
information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with entering
into this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements of
law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representative to
keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.2 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date
hereof in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such
information (i) was already known to such party, (ii) becomes available
to such party from other sources not known by such party to be bound by
a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written
approval of the providing party or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable
from publicly available sources. If this Agreement is terminated or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be
consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or
extracts thereof containing information and data as to the other party to be
returned to the other party.   (c) No investigation by either of the
parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations
and warranties of the other set forth herein.   6.3 Shareholders\'
Approvals. Each of CAVB and PNFP shall call a meeting of its shareholders to
be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon
proposals to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger Agreement and the
Merger, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts, to cause
such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same
date. The Board of Directors of each of PNFP and CAVB shall use its
reasonable best efforts (and subject to its fiduciary duty) to obtain from
the shareholders of PNFP and CAVB, as the case may be, the vote in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement required by the TBCA and PNFP\'s and CAVB\'s
charter and bylaws, as the case may be to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless
this Agreement has been terminated, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of CAVB and PNFP at such meeting for the purpose of obtaining
the CAVB Shareholder Approval or PNFP Shareholder Approval, as the case may
be, and voting on the approval and   35    adoption of this Agreement
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve CAVB and PNFP of such
obligations.   6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of CAVB and PNFP shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by PNFP or CAVB or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5 Affiliates. CAVB shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other
person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act) of CAVB to deliver to PNFP, as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, and prior to the date of the shareholders\' meetings called
by CAVB to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the form
of Exhibit 6.5.   6.6 Stock Quotation or Listing. PNFP shall cause the
shares of PNFP Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be qualified for
quotation or listing on the NASDAQ National Market, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. PNFP shall cause the shares
of CAVB Common Stock to be de-listed with the NASDAQ National Market and the
SEC after the Effective Time.   6.7 Employee Benefit Plans; Existing
Agreements.   (a) As of the Effective Time, to the extent permissible under
the terms of the PNFP employee benefit Plans, the employees of CAVB and its
Subsidiaries (the "CAVB Employees") shall be eligible to participate in
PNFP\'s employee benefit plans in which similarly situated employees of PNFP
or its Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent as similarly situated
employees of PNFP or its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of
CAVB Employees in PNFP\'s employee benefit plans may occur at different times
with respect to different plans) except as provided below.   (b) With
respect to each PNFP Plan that is an "employee benefit plan," as defined in
section 3(3) of ERISA, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits
and vacation entitlement, service with CAVB shall be treated as service with
PNFP; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication or increase of
benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any preexisting condition limitations. Each PNFP employee benefit plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable CAVB employee benefit plan. CAVB Employees shall be given credit
for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period
for purposes of   36     applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the PNFP employee benefit plans.   (c) From and
after the Effective Time, PNFP or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
will assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of PNFP to
assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all employment, severance,
change of control and other compensation agreements and arrangements between
CAVB or its Subsidiaries and any employee thereof, and all accrued and vested
benefit obligations, including any related to CAVB\'s Director Supplemental
Retirement Plan or Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan, existing prior to
the execution of this Agreement which are between CAVB or any of
its Subsidiaries and any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant thereof. PNFP acknowledges and agrees that the Merger shall
constitute a "Change of Control" or "Change in Control" as defined in such
agreements and further agrees that any subsequent voluntary termination by
those employees subject to severance agreements and set forth on Section
6.7(e) of the CAVB Disclosure Schedule of his or her employment within twelve
(12) months of the Effective Time shall automatically obligate PNFP or the
Surviving Corporation to make payment of obligations under any such
agreements.   (d) From and after the Effective Time, PNFP or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will, and will cause any applicable Subsidiary
thereof or Employee Benefit Plan, to provide or pay when due to CAVB\'s
employees as of the Effective Time all benefits and compensation pursuant to
CAVB\'s Employee Plans, programs and arrangements in effect on the date
hereof earned or accrued through, and to which such individuals are entitled
as of the Effective Time (or such later time as such Employee Benefit Plans
as in effect at the Effective Time are terminated or canceled by PNFP or the
Surviving Corporation) subject to compliance with the terms of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any amounts accrued for the benefit
of the employees of the CAVB as of the Effective Time, payable pursuant to
CAVB\'s and its Subsidiaries cash bonus plan based on return on equity, which
amount PNFP agrees to pay within ten (10) days following the Closing of the
Merger.   6.8 Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.   (a)
In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer or employee of CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries, or who is or was
serving at the request of CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another person, including any entity
specified in the CAVB Disclosure Schedule (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or
is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries or any
entity specified in the CAVB Disclosure Schedule or any of their respective
predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after
the Effective Time, PNFP shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,   37   expenses (including
reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition
of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required
by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.   (b) PNFP shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the individuals serving as officers and directors of CAVB, its Subsidiaries
or any entity specified in the CAVB Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of limitations, if
longer) by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy
maintained by CAVB (provided that PNFP may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers
and directors in their capacity as such.   (c) In the event PNFP or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of PNFP assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.8.   (d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.   6.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any time before or
after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any
merger between a Subsidiary of PNFP, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of
CAVB, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any
of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, PNFP. As long as PNFP has certified to CAVB that all conditions to
Closing have been met as described in this Agreement, if PNFP makes a request
to CAVB to make accounting adjustments prior to the Effective Time, such
changes shall be made, but to the extent CAVB might not have otherwise made
such adjustments except at the request of PNFP, such changes shall not impact
the calculation of income or financial returns for purposes of determining
the bonuses of employees of CAVB or its Subsidiaries.   6.10 Advice of
Changes. CAVB and PNFP shall each promptly advise the other party of any
change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained herein; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided further that a
failure to comply with   38    this Section 6.10 shall not constitute
the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless
the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied.   6.11 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). PNFP and
CAVB agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain CAVB
Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that CAVB Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of
shares of CAVB Common Stock and CAVB Stock Options into shares of PNFP Common
Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this Section 6.11. Assuming that CAVB delivers to PNFP the
Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, the Board of
Directors of PNFP, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by CAVB Insiders of PNFP Common
Stock in exchange for shares of CAVB Common Stock, and of options on PNFP
Common Stock upon conversion of options on CAVB Common Stock, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. The
term "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material
respects regarding CAVB Insiders, the number of shares of CAVB Common Stock
held by each such CAVB Insider and expected to be exchanged for PNFP Common
Stock in the Merger, and the number and description of the options on CAVB
Common Stock held by each such CAVB Insider and expected to be converted into
options on PNFP Common Stock in connection with the Merger; provided that the
requirement for a description of any CAVB Stock Options shall be deemed to be
satisfied if copies of all CAVB Stock Plans, and forms of agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, under which such CAVB Stock Options have been
granted, have been made available to PNFP. The term "CAVB Insiders" shall
mean those officers and directors of CAVB who are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the
Section 16 Information.   6.12 Acquisition Proposals.   (a) CAVB and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries) shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any other parties that may be ongoing with respect to the
possibility or consideration of any Acquisition Proposal, as defined below.
From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, CAVB shall not,
nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any of its or its Subsidiaries\' directors, officers or employees or
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other
action designed to facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition   39    Proposal or (iii) make or authorize
any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any representative
of CAVB, whether or not such representative is so authorized and whether or
not such representative is purporting to act on behalf of such party or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by CAVB.   (b)
(i)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of CAVB shall be
permitted, prior to its meeting of shareholders to be held pursuant
to Section 6.3, to engage in discussions and negotiations with, or provide
any nonpublic information or data to, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such person made after
the date of this Agreement which its Board of Directors concludes in good
faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
as defined below, if and only to the extent that the Board of Directors of
CAVB reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable law and subject to compliance with the other terms of
this Section 6.12 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement
having provisions that are no less restrictive to such person than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.   (ii) CAVB shall notify PNFP
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to
CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that informs CAVB or any of its
Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry from any person seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with such party relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals
or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related
documentation or correspondence). CAVB shall also promptly, and in any event
within 24 hours, notify PNFP, orally and in writing, if it enters into
discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides
nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with this Section
6.12(b) and keep PNFP informed of the status and terms of any such proposals,
offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by
providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto.   (iii) Nothing contained in this Section 6.14 shall prohibit CAVB
or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit
or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under
any other provision of this Agreement.   (c) CAVB agrees that (i) it will
and will cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors,
agents, representatives and advisors to, cease immediately and terminate any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and
(ii) it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  
40     (d) Nothing in this Section 6.12 shall (x) permit CAVB to terminate
this Agreement or (y) affect any other obligation of CAVB under this
Agreement. CAVB shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.   (e) For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or
offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice (whether in draft or
final form) or disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any
person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a
business that constitutes a substantial portion of the net revenues, net
income or assets of CAVB or any of its significant subsidiaries (as defined
under Regulation S-X of the SEC), (x) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of any class of equity securities representing 10% or more of
the voting power of CAVB or its significant subsidiaries, (y) tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 10% or more of the voting power of CAVB, or (z) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries,
in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of CAVB
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
legal advisors, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal (including
any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation), (i) is more favorable to the shareholders of CAVB from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) is fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed,
reasonably likely to receive all required governmental approvals on a timely
basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed; provided that, for purposes of this definition of "Superior
Proposal," the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 6.12(e) except that the reference to "10% or more" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"a majority" and "Acquisition Proposal" shall only be deemed to refer to a
transaction involving CAVB.   6.13 Bank Merger. At or prior to the Effective
Time, if requested by PNFP, CAVB shall cause CAVB BANK to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Bank Merger Agreement") with PNFP BANK
pursuant to which CAVB BANK shall merge with and into PNFP BANK after the
Merger. Promptly following execution of such Bank Merger Agreement, CAVB
shall approve such agreement as the sole shareholder of CAVB BANK. The Bank
Merger Agreement shall contain such terms and conditions as are reasonable,
normal and customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby
including a covenant that consummation of the merger of CAVB BANK with and
into PNFP BANK would not occur earlier than simultaneous with consummation of
the Merger and a provision for termination of the Bank Merger Agreement upon
termination of this Agreement.   41     ARTICLE VII.  CONDITIONS

after approval of the Merger by the shareholders of CAVB or PNFP:   (a) by

Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its
respective entire Board of Directors;   (b) by either the Board of Directors
of PNFP or the Board of Directors of CAVB, upon written notice to the other

competent jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting

and non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, such action;   (c) by either the Board of Directors of PNFP
or the Board of Directors of CAVB, upon written notice to the other party, if
the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before March 31, 2006;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply
with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;   (d) by
either CAVB or PNFP (provided that the party terminating shall not be in
material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.3) if any approval
of the shareholders of CAVB or PNFP required for the consummation of the
Merger shall not have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at a duly
held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof;   (e) by either PNFP or CAVB (provided that the terminating party

the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other
party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following written notice
to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot
be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)
unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such
breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation not to

case of a breach of a representation or warranty by PNFP) or Section 7.3(a)
(in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by CAVB);

prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) unless the
breach of covenant, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the
party entitled to the benefit of such covenant not to consummate the

breach of covenant by PNFP) or Section 7.3(b) (in the case of a breach of
covenant by CAVB); or   (g) by either PNFP or CAVB, if (i) the Board of
Directors of the other does not publicly recommend in the Joint Proxy
Statement that its shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement, (ii) after
recommending in the Joint Proxy Statement that such shareholders approve and
adopt this Agreement, such Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified

(iii) the other party materially breaches its obligations under this
Agreement by reason of a failure to call a meeting of its shareholders or a
failure to prepare and mail to its shareholders the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in accordance with Sections 6.1 and 6.3.   (h) by PNFP,
if the Board of Directors of CAVB has authorized, recommended, proposed or
publicly announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose any

by either CAVB or PNFP as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of PNFP or CAVB or their respective officers or directors, except with
respect to Sections 6.2(b), which may be enforced by injunction restraining
the breaching party from violation of this provision, the parties hereby
consent to such injunction, 8.2, 8.3, 9.4, and 9.10, which shall survive such
termination. Liabilities or damages arising out of the willful breach of this
Agreement shall be assessed and paid in the amount of $2.5 million by such
breaching party to the other party.   8.3 Termination Fee.   (a) As an
alternative to the fee specified in Section 8.2, PNFP may request that CAVB
shall pay PNFP, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of
$5.0 million (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated
as follows:   (i) if PNFP shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), then CAVB shall pay the Termination Fee on the business day
following such termination;   (ii) if (A) either party shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) because the required CAVB shareholder
approval shall not have been   45    received and (B) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and at or before the date of the CAVB Shareholders
Meeting a bona fide Acquisition Transaction, as defined below, shall have
been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Board of Directors
of CAVB (a "Public Proposal") that has not been withdrawn prior to such date,
then CAVB shall pay one-third of the Termination Fee on the business day
following such termination; and if (C) within twelve (12) months of the date
of such termination of this Agreement, CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into any definitive Agreement with respect to, or consummates, any
Acquisition Transaction, then CAVB shall pay the remaining two-thirds of the
Termination Fee on the date of such execution or consummation; and   (iii)
if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
or PNFP shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or (f), (B)
at any time after the date of this Agreement and before such termination
there shall have been a Public Proposal with respect to CAVB that has not
been withdrawn prior to such termination, and (C) following the occurrence of
such Public Proposal, CAVB shall have intentionally breached (and not cured
after notice thereof) any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach shall have materially
contributed to the failure of the Effective Time to occur prior to the
termination of this Agreement, then CAVB shall pay one-third of
the Termination Fee on the business day following such termination; and (D)
if within twelve (12) months of the date of such termination of this
Agreement, CAVB or any of its Subsidiaries executes any definitive agreement
with respect to, or consummates, any Acquisition Transaction, then CAVB shall
pay the remaining two-thirds of the Termination Fee upon the date of such
execution or consummation.   (b) If either party fails to pay all amounts
due to the other party under Sections 8.2 or 8.3 on the dates specified, then
the nonpaying party shall pay all costs and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection with any action or
proceeding (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken by it to collect such
unpaid amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime
lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street
Journal, from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually received by the other party.   (c) The parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in Section 8.2 and 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages
and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not
have entered into this Agreement.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (i) the direct or indirect
acquisition, purchase or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the
assets or deposits of CAVB, (ii) the acquisition by any person of direct or
indirect beneficial ownership (including by way of merger, consolidation,
share exchange or otherwise) of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
voting stock of CAVB, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction of or involving CAVB, other
than a merger, business combination or similar transaction pursuant to which
persons who are shareholders of CAVB immediately prior to such transaction
own 60% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity (or parent
thereof) immediately after consummation of such transaction and, as a result
of such transaction, no person or group (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) holds 20% or more of the voting stock
of the surviving entity (or parent thereof) immediately following
consummation of such transaction.   46     8.4 Amendment. Subject to
compliance with applicable law and Section 1.1(b), this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of CAVB
and PNFP; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the respective shareholders of CAVB or
PNFP, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of CAVB Common
Stock, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.   8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
