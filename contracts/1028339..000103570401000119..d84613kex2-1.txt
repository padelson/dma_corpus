of Company Stockholder Agreement  Exhibit B Form of Company Affiliate
Agreement  Exhibit C Form of Employment and Non-Competition
Agreement     -iv-    6     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION    This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of February 20, 2001, among Sybase,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Neel Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and New
Era of Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("COMPANY").    RECITALS  
The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved this Agreement, and declared advisable that Merger Sub make
an exchange offer (the "OFFER") to exchange shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") for all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share
("COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), of Company (the "SHARES") and the merger of Merger
Sub with and into Company (the "MERGER") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware ("DELAWARE LAW").   A. It is intended that,
for United States federal income tax purposes, the Offer and the Merger
(together, the "TRANSACTION") shall be treated as an integrated transaction
and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"). For accounting
purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as a "purchase" under
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").   B.
Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition and
inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement: (1) the
directors, executive officers and certain stockholders of Company
are entering into Stockholder Agreements in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS"), (2) the Company
Affiliates (as defined in Section 5.15) are entering into Company Affiliate
Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"COMPANY AFFILIATE AGREEMENTS"), and (3) George Adam, Patrick Fortune,
Fredrick Horn and Peter Hoversten are entering into Employment and Non-
Competition Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C.   C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as
a condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, (i) certain officers of Company have entered into amendments to
the Change of Control Severance Agreements to which such officers are party
to, among other things, waive certain severance and other rights that may be
triggered as a direct or indirect result of the transactions contemplated
hereby (each, a "SEVERANCE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT"), and (ii) Company and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company have amended (the "RIGHTS PLAN
AMENDMENT") the Preferred Shares Right Agreement, dated August 5, 1998 (the
"COMPANY RIGHTS PLAN"), to render the Rights thereunder inapplicable to the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Company Stockholder Agreements.   7  NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the covenants, promises and representations set forth
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE OFFER AND THE MERGER   Section 1.01 The Offer.
(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 7.01 and (ii) none of the events set forth in Annex I
hereto that would entitle Parent and Merger Sub to fail to consummate the
Offer shall have occurred and be continuing, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, commence the Offer. Each Share accepted by
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive
from Merger Sub that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean 0.3878. The initial expiration date of the
Offer shall be the twentieth business day following commencement of the
Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be
validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the
expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Shares which,
together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub (if any)
represents at least a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares,
assuming the exercise of all currently exercisable options, rights and
convertible securities (if any) and the issuance of all Shares that Company
is obligated to issue thereunder (such total number of outstanding Shares
being hereinafter referred to as the "FULLY DILUTED SHARES") (the "MINIMUM
CONDITION") and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Parent
and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive the conditions to the
Offer and to make any change in the terms or conditions of the Offer;
provided that, without the prior written consent of Company, no change may be
made which decreases the number of Shares sought in the Offer, changes the
form or amount of consideration to be paid, imposes conditions to the
Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I, changes or waives the
Minimum Condition or any of the other conditions set forth in Annex I,
extends the Offer (except as set forth in the following two sentences), or
makes any other change to any of the terms and conditions to the Offer which
is adverse to the holders of Shares. Subject to the terms of the Offer and
this Agreement and the satisfaction (or waiver to the extent permitted by
this Agreement) of the conditions to the Offer, Merger Sub shall accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer and
shall pay for all such Shares promptly after acceptance; provided that (x)
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods not in
excess of 10 business days per extension if, at the scheduled expiration date
of the Offer or any extension thereof, any of the conditions to the Offer
shall not have been satisfied, until such time as such conditions are
satisfied or waived, and (y) Merger Sub may extend the Offer if and to the
extent required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In addition, Merger Sub may extend the Offer
after the acceptance of Shares thereunder for a further period of time by
means of a subsequent offering period under Rule 14d-11 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), of not
more than 20 business days to meet the objective (which is not a condition to
the Offer) that there be validly tendered, in accordance with the terms of
the Offer, prior to the expiration date of the Offer (as so extended) and
not withdrawn a number of   -2-  8  Shares which, together with Shares
then owned by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least 90% of the Fully
Diluted Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued
in connection with the exchange of Parent Common Stock for Shares upon
consummation of the Offer, but in lieu thereof each tendering stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that
otherwise would be received by such holder) in the Offer shall receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the
closing price of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock on the first
date Merger Sub accepts Shares for exchange in the Offer, as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ").   (b) As soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 to register the offer and sale of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT"). The
Registration Statement will include a preliminary prospectus containing the
information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act
(the "PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS"). As soon as practicable on the date of
commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which will
contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the Preliminary Prospectus
and form of the related letter of transmittal (together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, collectively the "OFFER DOCUMENTS") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent, Merger Sub
and Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Registration Statement or the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent
and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Company and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO, the
Registration Statement and the Offer Documents prior to their being filed
with the SEC. Parent agrees to provide Company and its counsel with any
comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive in writing from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as soon as practicable
after receipt of such written comments.   Section 1.02 Company Action. (a)
Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of
Directors, at a meeting duly called and held on or prior to the date hereof,
has by the unanimous vote of all directors present and voting (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term
business strategy of Company and are advisable and are fair to and in the
best interest of Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger and the Company Stockholder Agreements and the transactions
contemplated thereby, which approval constitutes approval under Section 203
of Delaware Law such that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and the Company Stockholder Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, are not and shall not be subject
to any restriction pursuant to Section 203 of Delaware Law, and (iii)
resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption  
-3-  9 of this Agreement by Company\'s stockholders (the recommendations
referred to in this clause (iii) are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the "RECOMMENDATIONS"). Company has been advised that all of its
directors and executive officers and each stockholder party to the Company
Stockholder Agreements currently intend to tender their Shares pursuant to
the Offer.   (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer
is commenced, Company will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the
"SCHEDULE 14D-9") which shall include the opinion of Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation referred to in Section 2.20 and, subject to Section
5.03(b), shall include the Recommendations; provided, however, that prior to
the Appointment Time the Board of Directors of Company may withhold,
withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make,
its Recommendations in accordance with the terms of Section 5.03(b). Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. Company agrees to take
all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the SEC. Company agrees to
provide Parent and its counsel with any comments Company or its counsel
receives in writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 as soon as practicable after receipt of such written comments.   (c)
Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as
of the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent and
Merger Sub such additional information (including, without limitation,
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer.   Section 1.03 Directors. (a)
Effective upon the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to
the Offer (the "APPOINTMENT TIME"), Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on Company\'s Board
of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on
Company\'s Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any
additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.03) and (ii) the percentage
that the number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including Shares
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and
Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause
Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to Company\'s Board of
Directors, including, without limitation, increasing the number of directors,
or seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors, or both;
provided that, prior to the Effective Time, Company\'s Board of Directors
shall always have at least two members who were directors of Company prior to
consummation of the Offer (each, a "CONTINUING DIRECTOR"). If the number of
Continuing Directors is reduced to less than two for any reason prior to the
Effective Time, the remaining and departing Continuing Directors shall be
entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy. Notwithstanding   -4- 
10  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent\'s designees are
elected to Company\'s Board of Directors prior to the Effective Time, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required
for Company to (a) amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to
any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (b) waive any of Company\'s
rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time for performance
of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s respective obligations hereunder, or (d)
approve any other action by Company which is reasonably likely to adversely
affect the interests of the stockholders of Company (other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their affiliates (other than Company and its subsidiaries)),
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)
Company\'s obligations to appoint designees to its Board of Directors shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated
thereunder. Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to
Section 1.03 and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to Company and its officers and directors as is required
under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l. Parent will supply to Company in writing
and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.   Section 1.04 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.05) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."   Section
1.05 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
Company and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the "CERTIFICATE OF
MERGER") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date (as herein defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term
"AGREEMENT" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization and the Certificate of Merger. The closing of the Merger
(the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, One Market, Spear Street Tower, Suite 3300,
San Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties,
which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time,
date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING
DATE").   Section 1.06 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving   -5-  11  Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.07 Certificate of
Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective
Time, subject to the provisions of Section 5.14 hereof, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be
the same in substance as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of
Company shall remain "New Era of Networks, Inc."), and such Certificate of
Incorporation of Company, as so amended and restated, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with Delaware Law and such Certificate of
Incorporation.   (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.14 hereof, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be adopted as the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware
Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
Bylaws.   Section 1.08 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time until their successors shall have been duly
elected and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.  
Section 1.09 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any
of the following securities, the following shall occur:   (a) Conversion of
Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any share of
Company Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished pursuant to Section
1.09(b)) will be automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.09(e) and
(f)) into the right to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with the cash in lieu of Fractional
Shares of Parent Common Stock as specified below, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION")
upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common
Stock in the manner set forth in Section 1.10 hereof (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner set forth in Section 1.12 hereof). Except to
the extent otherwise provided for in any plan or agreement listed on
Section 2.03 or 2.18 of the Company Schedule applicable to such shares, any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture
or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement with Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common   -6-  12  Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends. Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.   (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned
and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent,
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or
Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Stock Options; Employee
Stock Purchase Plans. (i) At the Effective Time, all options to purchase
Company Common Stock then outstanding under Company\'s 1995 Stock Option
Plan, 1997 Director Option Plan, 1998 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, Century
Analysis, Inc. 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, Convoy Corporation 1997 Stock
Option Plan and Microscript 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "COMPANY OPTION
PLANS"), and the Company Option Plans themselves, shall be assumed by Parent
in accordance with Section 5.11(a) hereof.   (ii) At the Effective Time,
all purchase rights then outstanding under Company\'s 1997 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), and the ESPP itself, shall be treated as set
forth in Section 5.11(b) hereof.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each
share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER
SUB COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange
Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock occurring or having a record date on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (f) Fractional Shares. No
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that
otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such
holder\'s Certificates(s) (as defined in Section 1.10(c)) receive from Parent
an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the   -7-  13  product obtained by multiplying such fraction by
the closing price of one (1) share of Parent Common Stock on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on Nasdaq.   Section
1.10 Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company to act as the exchange
agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.   (b) Exchange Fund. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
for exchange in accordance with this Article I, an "EXCHANGE FUND" consisting
of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.09(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and cash in an
amount estimated to be sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section
1.10(d).   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates,
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the "CERTIFICATES") (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.09(a), cash
in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.10(d). Upon surrender
of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock
were converted pursuant to Section 1.09(a), payment in lieu of fractional
shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.09(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.10(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the ownership of the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been so converted pursuant to Section 1.09(a) (including any
voting, notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such
shares of Parent Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of Parent or under Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount in
cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with
Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.10(d).   (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of
this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered   -8- 
14  Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall
surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record
holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.09(f) hereof and the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.  
(e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or (ii) established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or state, local or foreign law.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (g) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.10,
neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with the provisions of this Section 1.10 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant
to Section 1.09(f) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.10(d),
in each case, without any interest thereon.   Section 1.11 No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.09(f) and 1.10(d)) shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company    -9- 
15  Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.   Section 1.12 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.09(a), cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.09(f) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.10(d); provided,
however, that Parent or the Exchange Agent, may, in its or their discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and the payment of cash and other
distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section 1.13 Tax and
Accounting Consequences.   (a) Tax. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Transaction shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.   (b) Accounting. It
is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a purchase
for accounting purposes.   Section 1.14 Taking of Necessary Action; Further
Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, Company,
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such necessary
action.   Section 1.15 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.09, if
the Merger is effectuated pursuant to Section 253 of Delaware Law,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Delaware
Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or
her right to appraisal. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to appraisal, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration. Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent   -10-  16  of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Any amounts paid to a holder
pursuant to a right of appraisal will be paid by Company out of its own funds
and will not be reimbursed by Parent or any affiliate of Parent.   ARTICLE

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 5.01 Stockholder Approval; Preparation of
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus. (a) If approval of
Company\'s stockholders is required by applicable law in order to consummate
the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of Delaware Law, following the
acceptance for exchange of Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Company
shall, as soon as practicable following the acceptance of Shares pursuant to
the Offer, prepare and Company shall file with the SEC the Company Proxy
Statement and Parent and Company shall prepare and Parent shall file with the
SEC a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement (the "POST-
EFFECTIVE   -41-  47  AMENDMENT") for the offer and sale of the Parent
Stock pursuant to the Merger and in which the Company Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of Company and Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to have the Post-Effective Amendment declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Company will use
all reasonable efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Company\'s stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Post-Effective
Amendment is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of
process) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Offer and the
Merger and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and the
holders of capital stock of Company as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Company Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Post-Effective
Amendment will be made by Parent, or with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement will be made by Company, without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will advise
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Post-Effective Amendment has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Post-Effective Amendment or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. Company
will advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request
by the SEC for the amendment of the Company Proxy Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Company or Parent which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Post-Effective
Amendment or the Company Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of Company.   (a) If approval of Company\'s stockholders is
required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger, Company shall
establish, prior to or as soon as practicable following the date upon which
the Post-Effective Amendment becomes effective, a record date (which shall be
prior to or as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Post-
Effective Amendment becomes effective) for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS
MEETING") for the purpose of considering the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and (with the consent of Parent) such other matters as may in the
reasonable judgment of Company be appropriate for consideration at the
Company Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company Stockholders Meeting has been
called and noticed, Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting (other than for the absence of a quorum) without the
consent of Parent. The Post-Effective Amendment and the Proxy Statement shall
include the   -42-  48  opinion of Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation
referred to in Section 2.20 and, subject to Company\'s right, pursuant to
Section 5.03(b) hereof, to withhold, withdraw, modify, change or fail to make
the Recommendations, the Board of Directors of Company shall include in the
Post-Effective Amendment and the Company Proxy Statement the Recommendations
as such Recommendations pertain to the Merger and this Agreement. Unless the
Board of Directors of Company shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified,
changed or failed to make its Recommendations in compliance with Section
5.03(b), Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required
by Delaware Law to effect the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company\'s obligation to establish
a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.01 shall not be
limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below).   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (a) and (b)
above, if Merger Sub shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares in
the Offer, the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions (including
actions referred to in clause (a) above, as applicable) to cause the Merger
to become effective, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer, without a meeting of stockholders of Company, in accordance with
Section 253 of Delaware Law.   Section 5.02 Regulatory Filings. (a) Promptly
after the date of this Agreement, each of Company and Parent will prepare and
file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ")
Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated
herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws and
regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties (the
"ANTITRUST FILINGS") and (ii) any other filings required to be filed by it
under the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other federal, state or
foreign laws relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "OTHER FILINGS"). Company and Parent each shall promptly
supply the other with any information which may be required in order to
effectuate any filings pursuant to this Section 5.02. In addition, Company
and Parent each shall each use all reasonable efforts to obtain
early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act and Company and
Parent shall each promptly (a) supply the other with any information which
may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any
additional information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ
or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction
and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; provided, however,
that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or
Company or any of Parent\'s subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital
stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or its subsidiaries or
affiliates or of Company, its affiliates, or the imposition of any material
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to
own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.   (b) Each of
Company and Parent will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials in
connection with any filing made pursuant hereto and of any request by the SEC
or its staff or any other government   -43-  49  officials for amendments
or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Post-Effective Amendment,
the Company Proxy Statement or any Antitrust Filings or Other Filings or for
additional information and will supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Registration Statement, the Post-
Effective Amendment, the Company Proxy Statement, the Merger or any Antitrust
Filing or Other Filing. Each of Company and Parent will cause all documents
that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory
authorities under Section 5.01 and this Section 5.02 to comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement the Registration
Statement, the Post-Effective Amendment, the Company Proxy Statement or any
Antitrust Filing or Other Filing, Company or Parent, as the case may be, will
promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
stockholders of Company and/or Parent, such amendment or supplement.  
Section 5.03 No Solicitation. (a) From the date hereof until the Appointment
Time or termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII hereof,
whichever is earlier, neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall, nor
shall Company or any of its subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its
or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents, advisors or
representatives retained by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to assist, facilitate, induce
or encourage the making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish any information relating to
Company or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of Company or any of its subsidiaries to
any person that has made, or knowingly take any other action to assist or
facilitate any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any letter
of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or commitment
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal.   (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Appointment Time the Board of
Directors of Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (i) subject to Company\'s compliance with Section
5.03(a), engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any third
party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to such third party nonpublic information
relating to Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, and/or (iii) following receipt of such an
Acquisition Proposal, withhold, withdraw, modify or change in a
manner adverse to Parent, or fail to make, its Recommendations and approve,
endorse or recommend such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that in each case
(1) neither Company nor any representative of Company and its subsidiaries
shall have violated any   -44-  50  of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.03 in connection with such Acquisition Proposal or person
making such Acquisition Proposal, (2) the Board of Directors of Company
concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that in light of such Superior Proposal such action is required for the Board
of Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
Company\'s stockholders under Delaware Law, (3) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any
such discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, Company gives
Parent written notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of
Company\'s intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, and (4)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
person or group, Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by
Company to Parent). Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03 by any officer, director or
employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.03 by Company.
In addition to the foregoing, Company shall (i) provide Parent with at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided
to the members of Company\'s Board of Directors but in no event less than
eight (8) hours) of any meeting of Company\'s Board of Directors at
which Company\'s Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider a
Superior Proposal and (ii) provide Parent with at least three (3) business
days prior written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of Company\'s Board of Directors) of a meeting of Company\'s Board of
Directors at which Company\'s Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
approve, endorse or recommend a Superior Proposal to its stockholders and
together with such notice a copy of the proposed form of agreement, letter of
intent or other definitive document containing the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal. Company shall not be entitled to enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or commitment
(other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted by this Section 5.03(b))
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal unless and
until this Agreement is terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 7.01(d)
and Company has paid all amounts due to Parent pursuant to Section 8.03. This
Section 5.03(b) shall not prohibit Company\'s Board of Directors from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (iii) making any
disclosure to Company\'s stockholders that is required by law, or (iv) taking
any action ordered to be taken by Company by any court of
competent jurisdiction.   (c) In addition to the obligations of Company set
forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.03, Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, shall
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for nonpublic information
which Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal, of
any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to or which Company
reasonably believes would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or    -45- 
51  inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed
as promptly as reasonably practicable in all material respects of the status
and details (including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.   For purposes of this
Agreement, "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal not received in violation of Section 5.03(a) for at least a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on terms that the Board of
Directors of Company determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
are more favorable to Company\'s stockholders than as provided hereunder;
provided, however, that any such proposal shall not be deemed to be a
"Superior Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely in the good
faith judgment of Company\'s Board of Directors to be obtained by such
third party on a timely basis. An Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded
from constituting a "Superior Proposal" solely as a result of such
Acquisition Proposal being conditioned upon the completion of due
diligence.   For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall
mean any offer or proposal by a third party (other than Parent, Merger Sub,
or any affiliate thereof) relating to: (A) any acquisition or purchase from
Company by any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a 15%
interest in the outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning
15% or more of the outstanding voting securities of Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company
immediately preceding such transaction would hold less than 85% of the equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of the consolidated assets of
Company; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of Company.   Section 5.04
Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent will take all action necessary to cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement.   Section 5.05 Voting of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub
agree to vote all Shares acquired in the Offer or otherwise beneficially
owned by them or any of their subsidiaries in favor of approval and adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting or pursuant to Section
253 of Delaware Law on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.   Section 5.06 Registration Statement. Parent shall promptly
prepare and file with the SEC under the Securities Act the Registration
Statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable.
Parent shall   -46-  52  promptly take any action required to be taken
under foreign or state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger. Parent shall include as exhibits to the
Registration Statement substantially identical opinions of Cooley Godward LLP
and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation (the opinion
of each firm to be addressed to such firm\'s respective client), in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and to Company confirming the
accuracy of that section of the Registration Statement titled "Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences."   Section 5.07 Confidentiality; Access to
Information. (a) The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have
previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 17,
2001 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), which Confidentiality Agreement will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.   (b)
Company will afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the properties, books, records and personnel of Company during the period
prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning the
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel of Company, as Parent may reasonably
request, including without limitation copies of working papers of
accountants, contracts, and other corporate documents, and access to other
parties with whom it has business dealings. Parent will afford Company and
its accountant, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the properties, book, records and personnel of
Parent during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain information
concerning the business of Parent as reasonably required by Company,
provided, however that in no event shall Parent be required to provide any
information with respect to forecasts and any other forward-looking
information, any working papers of accountants, any information regarding
personnel or any other information the provision of which would cause undue
disruption the Parent\'s business or would be deemed to be
competitively sensitive. No information or knowledge obtained by either party
in any investigation pursuant to this Section will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Offer and the Merger.  
Section 5.08 Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult with each
other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or Nasdaq, in which case reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party will be made prior to such release or public
statement; provided, however, that no such consultation or agreement shall be
required if, prior to the date of such release or public statement, Company
shall have withheld, withdrawn, modified, changed or failed to make its
Recommendations in compliance with Section 5.03(b). The parties have agreed
to the text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this
Agreement.   Section 5.09 Reasonable Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take,    -47-  53  or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in Annex I (if they remain applicable) and
Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as
may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
carry out fully the purposes of, this Agreement. If any state
takeover statute is or may become applicable to the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Company
and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and
use reasonable efforts to take such lawful actions as are necessary to ensure
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute and any regulations promulgated
thereunder on such transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be under any
obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to
orders providing for the sale, license or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent, any of its affiliates or Company or its
subsidiaries or the holding separate of the shares of Company Common Stock
(or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or imposing or seeking to
impose any limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or

(a) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") under the
Company Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of   -49-  55  Company, Parent or any
holder of Company Stock Option, be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock
Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the
acceleration of vesting on certain transactions, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent otherwise
provided for in any plan or agreement applicable to such Company Stock
Options and disclosed on Section 2.03 or 2.18 of the Company Schedule),
except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Company Stock
Options. It is intended that Company Stock Options assumed by Parent shall
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
provisions of this Section 5.11 shall be applied consistent with such
intent in accordance with Section 424 of the Code. Parent shall take all
corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company
Stock Options on the terms set forth in this Section 5.11(a).   (b) ESPP.
Prior to the Effective Time, outstanding purchase rights under Company\'s
ESPP shall be exercised in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. With
respect to each share of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the ESPP,
such exercise shall by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio without issuance
of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock to ESPP participants. Company shall terminate the ESPP effective at or
prior to the Closing.   Section 5.12 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a
registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options as soon as is
reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 business days) after the
Effective Time.   Section 5.13 Nasdaq Listing. Parent agrees to cause the
listing on Nasdaq the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those
required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Offer and
Merger, subject to official notice of issuance.   Section 5.14
Indemnification. (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
Company (or any predecessor corporation) pursuant to (i) each indemnification
agreement between Company and its   -50-  56  directors or officers in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
and (ii) any indemnification provision under the Company Charter Documents as
in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties
as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party or of
individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were employees or
agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law.   (b) For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will either (i)
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available,
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering those persons who are
currently covered by Company\'s directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policy on terms comparable to those applicable to the
current directors and officers of Company; provided, however, that in no
event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any
year in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for
such coverage (or such coverage as is available for such 150% of such annual
premium), or (ii) Parent may purchase directors\' and officers\' liability
tail coverage on terms comparable to those applicable to the current
directors and officers of Company covering all periods prior to the Effective
Time.   (c) This Section 5.14 shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
is intended to benefit Company, the Surviving Corporation and
each Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties.   Section 5.15 Company Affiliate Agreements. Set forth
in Section 5.15 of the Company Schedule is a complete and accurate list of
those persons who may be deemed to be, in Company\'s reasonable judgment,
affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act (each, a "COMPANY AFFILIATE"). Company will provide Parent
with such information and documents as Parent reasonably requests for
purposes of reviewing such list. Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, on or as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, from each Company Affiliate that has
not delivered a Company Affiliate Agreement on or prior to the date hereof,
an executed Company Affiliate Agreement. Each Company Affiliate Agreement
will be in full force and effect as of the Effective Time. Parent will be
entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any
Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company Affiliate pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions
to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock, consistent with the terms
of the Company Affiliate Agreement.   Section 5.16 Termination of Certain
Company Plans. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time, Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and
all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements and any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (unless Parent provides written   -51-  57  notice to
Company that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). Unless
Parent provides such written notice to Company, no later than three business
days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall provide Parent with evidence
that such plans, programs or arrangements have been terminated (effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions
of Company\'s Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such plans, programs or
arrangements as Parent may reasonably require.   Section 5.17 Tax Matters.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company agrees that it will not engage in any
action, or fail to take any action, and will cause its respective
subsidiaries not to engage in any action, or fail to take any action, which
action or failure to take action would reasonably be expected to cause the
Transaction to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code, whether or not otherwise permitted by the provisions of
this Agreement. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company agrees to provide
customary and appropriate representations to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and
Rosati, Professional Corporation, and Cooley Godward LLP in support of their
tax opinions referred to in Section 5.06 and Annex I, as mutually agreed upon
by the parties\' counsel.   Section 5.18 No Rights Plan Amendment. Prior to
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing, Company and
its Board of Directors shall not amend or modify or take any other action
with regard to the Company Rights Plan in any manner or take another action
so as to (i) render the Company Rights Plan inapplicable to any
transaction(s) other than the Offer, the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Agreements, or
(ii) permit any person or group (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their affiliates) who would otherwise be an Acquiring Person (as defined in
the Company Rights Plan) not to be an Acquiring Person, or (iii) provide that
a Distribution Date or a Shares Acquisition Date (as such terms are defined
in the Company Rights Plan) or similar event does not occur as promptly as
practicable by reason of the execution of any agreement or transaction other
than this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Agreements and the Offer, the
Merger and the agreements and transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
or (iv) except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, otherwise
affect the rights of holders of Rights.   Section 5.19 Employee Benefits.
(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries will honor in accordance with their terms all existing
employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements between
Company or any of its subsidiaries and any current or former executive
officer or director of Company or any of its subsidiaries, which agreements
are described on Section 5.19 of the Company Schedule, subject to any
modifications thereto agreed to by any such officers or directors with the
Surviving Corporation, including the Severance Agreement Amendments.   (b)
In addition to honoring the agreements referred to in Section 5.19 of the
Company Schedule, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
benefits (including health benefits, severance policies and
general employment policies and procedures) which are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to benefits that are available to similarly
situated   -52-  58  employees of Parent and its subsidiaries as of the
date hereof, provided, however, that such insurance carriers, outsider
providers or the like are able to provide such benefits on terms reasonably
acceptable to Parent, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section
5.19(b) shall prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
from making any change required by applicable law, and provided, further,
that it shall not result in any duplication of benefits.   (c) To the
extent permitted under applicable law, each employee of Company or its
subsidiaries shall be given credit for all service with Company or its
subsidiaries (or service credited by Company or its subsidiaries) under all
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation (other than sabbatical benefits,
for which employees of Company or its subsidiaries will not receive any such
past service credit) in which they participate or in which they become
participants for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
including, without limitation, for purposes of determining (i) short-term and
long-term disability benefits, (ii) severance benefits, (iii) vacation
benefits and (iv) benefits under any retirement plan; provided, however, that
no service credit for benefit accrual purposes shall be provided under any
defined benefit pension plan or in any other circumstance that would result
in duplicative accrual of benefits, and provided, further, that such
insurance carriers, outsider providers or the like are able to honor such
commitments on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent.   Section 5.20 Action
by Board of Directors. Prior to the Appointment Time, the Board of Directors
of Parent, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof,
shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the
SEC so that (i) the assumption of Company Stock Options held by Company
Insiders (as defined below) pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the receipt
by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, shall in each case be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act by any officer or
director of Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a "COMPANY INSIDER").   ARTICLE VI

matter, after reasonable inquiry of such matter.   (d) For purposes of this
