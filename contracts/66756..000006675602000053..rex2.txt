         2.3    Consideration

         (A)    INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS. The  consideration  for  the  Assets  will
be four  hundred  seventy-one  million  ($471,000,000),  as may be  adjusted  as
provided below in subsection 2.3(C) (the "Purchase  Price").  The Purchase Price
will be payable in Installments  delivered by wire transfer from Buyer to Seller
as follows:

                   DATE PAYABLE                INSTALLMENT        AMOUNT DUE

         At the Closing                       Installment 1      $433,000,000
         On the third anniversary date
          of the closing                      Installment 2       $38,000,000


         (B)    ANNUAL NET REVENUE DEFERRAL. Seller and  Buyer  have  prepared a
pro forma based upon the  current  Costs of  Operation  and  Maintenance  of the
System and the

                                       15

<PAGE>

current  schedule of rates,  fees  and  charges for the  services of  the System
(without  any rate  increases,  but  adjusted  for  indexing) a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit Z.

         Based on the pro forma, the  parties  anticipate  that  the Buyer  will
realize Net Revenues in each of the first four 12 month  periods  following  the
Closing  ("Test  Year(s)")  sufficient  to (i) fund the Renewal and  Replacement
Requirement,  (ii) fund (iii) the Capital  Improvement  Plan  Requirement pay 30
year level debt service on the  Acquisition  Bonds,  and (iv) provide Buyer with
net  profits  of  $4.5  Million.   The  remaining   bond  proceeds  for  capital
improvements  funded in the Acquisition  Bonds,  plus interest  earnings on such
bond proceeds,  may be allocated to fund short falls in the Capital  Improvement
Requirement  in each of the Test Years in such  amounts as may be  necessary  to
meet such Test Year's Net Revenues test (the "Capital Funds Allocation").

         Each year, Buyer and Seller will review  the Net Revenues. In the event
Buyer determines that Net Revenues, together with any revenue guarantee payments
pursuant to  subsection  (E) below,  are not  sufficient  to provide all of such
amounts in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding  sentence,  the Buyer shall
notify the Seller of such determination, and confer with the Buyer's underwriter
and Seller to set forth in full its reasoning therefore. At the end of 36 months
following the Closing, such portions of Installment 2 shall be deferred one year
or such time as necessary so that the Installment  will be equal to Net Revenues
less the  amounts  set forth in (i)  through  (iv) in the  preceding  paragraph.
Notwithstanding  the above, the balance of any unpaid Purchase Price as a result
of this subsection  shall be paid to Seller within five (5) years of the date of
Closing.

         (C)    PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.    Installment  2  of  the  Purchase
Price may be reduced under the following circumstances:

                (i)    the amount necessary to fund any  indemnity  amounts owed
by Seller under Article 11 hereunder, and

                (ii)   for all Remedial Capital Projects Amounts.

         Within 20 days of the execution of  this Agreement, Seller will provide
Buyer with its'  current  five year  capital  improvement  program.  Buyer shall
notify Seller in writing of the Remedial Capital Projects Amount, if any. Seller
shall  identify  the  projects and  estimated  costs that  comprise the Remedial
Capital  Projects  Amount which are not  included on Seller's  five year capital
improvement  program.  If Seller  does not  concur  that a project is a Remedial
Capital Project or part of the Capital  Improvement Plan Requirement  during the
initial  five year post Closing time period the matter shall be submitted to the
dispute resolution process set forth in 13.5.

                                       16

<PAGE>

         (D)    DISPUTE  RESOLUTION. Prior  to  implementing  any  reduction  or
offset,  the Buyer  shall  provide  written  notice  to  Seller of any  proposed
reduction or offset. Seller shall have twenty (20) days to provide Buyer written
notice of objection  to any such  reductions  or offset.  Buyer and Seller shall
have  sixty  (60) days  following  written  notice of  objection  from  Buyer to
amicably  resolve  Buyer's  objections.  To the extent any objections  cannot be
reconciled,  either party may submit such  objection  to the Dispute  Resolution
Process. Buyer may at any time deposit any Reduction Amount with an escrow agent
pending a final resolution under the Dispute Resolution Process,  pursuant to an
Escrow Agreement reasonably  satisfactory to the parties and to the extent Buyer
has done so Buyer shall not be deemed in default hereunder.

         (E)    Seller shall provide a guarantee ("Guarantee") in the form to be
agreed  upon with 30 days  after  execution  of this  Agreement  that Buyer will
receive Gross Revenues  constituting  monthly water and sewer charges  ("Monthly
Fees") for the first twelve months after Closing of $95,318,000;  for the second
twelve months of $97,701,000;  and for the third twelve months of  $100,143,000.
If the Buyer  lowers any Monthly  Fees during the  forgoing  time  periods,  the
amount guaranteed will be reduced by the amount the Monthly Fees would have been
if such reduction had not occurred.

         (F)    The  Buyer agrees  to  use  all reasonable commercial efforts to
issue the Acquisition Bonds. In the event the Buyer, after consultation with the
Buyer's financial advisor(s),  underwriter(s),  legal advisors, and with Seller,
in good faith,  determines that some or all of such Acquisition  Bonds cannot be
sold on a date that  permits the  Closing to occur on or prior to  December  15,
2002,  in  that  the   Acquisition   Bonds  Net  Proceeds  would  be  less  than
$433,000,000,  then the Buyer shall immediately notify Seller in writing of such
determination,  with such notice  setting forth in  reasonable  detail the bases
upon which such  determination  was made,  and the  requirements,  if reasonably
ascertainable  to  Seller,  for  ultimate  issuance  of all of the Bonds or such
portion thereof that would result in Acquisition  Bond Net Proceeds  received in
an amount  equal to or greater  than  $433,000,000  on or prior to December  15,
2002.  Upon  receipt of such notice  Seller  shall have the option of (1) at any
time  between the receipt of the notice and the  issuance of the Bonds,  closing
the transaction,  and increasing the future  installments set forth above by the
amount that the Acquisition  Bonds Net Proceeds are less than $433,000,000 in an
equitable  manner as agreed to by both  Buyer and  Seller;  (2)  postponing  the
Closing until such time as Acquisition  Bonds resulting in Acquisition Bonds Net
Proceeds of not less than  $433,000,000  can  reasonably be issued in accordance
with this  Agreement;  or (3)  canceling  this  Agreement,  and,  if  cancelled,
thereupon  the  Buyer  and  Seller  shall  have no  liabilities  and no  further
obligations to each other under this Agreement,  except that Seller shall pay to
Buyer the Due Diligence Expenses.

                                       21

<PAGE>

may submit such dispute to the Dispute  Resolution  Process.  To the extent that
Eligible  Accounts (as hereinafter  defined) and Eligible  Unbilled Revenues (as
hereinafter defined) sold to the Seller hereunder as of the Effective Time minus
accounts payable assumed by the Buyer hereunder as of the Effective Time ("Final
Computed Amount") is in an amount greater than zero ($0) Dollars, then the Buyer
shall  immediately  pay to the Seller the  difference and to the extent that the
Final  Computed  Amount is less than zero ($0)  Dollars,  then the Seller  shall
immediately  pay to the Buyer  the  difference.  The  payment  in the  foregoing
sentence  shall be net of any payments made  pursuant to the second  sentence of
this Section.  "Eligible Accounts" means Accounts  Receivable  outstanding as of
the Effective Time that are actually collected by the Buyer within 90 days after
the Effective Time and "Eligible  Unbilled  Accounts"  means  Unbilled  Accounts
outstanding  as of the Effective  Time that are actually  collected by the Buyer

counsel acceptable to the Buyer stating that neither the City of Gulf Breeze nor
the City of Milton will be held liable,  as a matter of law, for the liabilities
of the Buyer and (ii) an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Buyer stating that
upon the acquisition of the System by the Buyer, the rates, fees and charges for
the services and  facilities  of the System are not subject to regulation by the
Florida Public Service Commission or any local regulatory authority.

         2.8    Consents

                (a)     If there  are  any Material Consents  that have not  yet
been obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) as of the Closing,
in the case of each Seller Contract as to which such Material  Consents were not
obtained  (or  otherwise  are not in full  force and  effect)  (the  "Restricted
Material  Contracts"),  Buyer may waive the  closing  conditions  as to any such
Material Consent and either:

                (i)     elect to have Seller continue its efforts to  obtain the
         Material Consents; or

                (ii)    elect to  have  Seller retain that  Restricted  Material
         Contract and all Liabilities arising therefrom or relating thereto; or

                (iii)   elect to have Seller require any other obligations under
         such  contract to perform  their  obligations  under such  contract and
         remit to Seller the amounts due to such obligations, for payment by the
         Seller to such obligations.

         If Buyer  elects  to  have  Seller  continue its efforts  to obtain any
Material Consents and the Closing occurs,  notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4,
neither this Agreement nor the Assignment and Assumption Agreement nor any other
document  related to the  consummation of the  Contemplated  Transactions  shall
constitute a sale, assignment,

                                       22

<PAGE>

assumption,  transfer,  conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment,
assumption,   transfer,  conveyance  or  delivery  of  the  Restricted  Material
Contracts,  and following the Closing,  the parties shall use Best Efforts,  and
cooperate  with each  other,  to obtain the  Material  Consent  relating to each
Restricted Material Contract as quickly as practicable. Pending the obtaining of
such Material Consents relating to any Restricted Material Contract, the parties
shall  cooperate  with each  other in any  reasonable  and  lawful  arrangements
designed  to provide to Buyer the  benefits  of use of the  Restricted  Material
Contract for its term (or any right or benefit arising thereunder, including the
enforcement  for the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of Seller  against a
third  party  thereunder).  Once a Material  Consent  for the sale,  assignment,
assumption,  transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Material Contract
is obtained,  Seller shall promptly  assign,  transfer,  convey and deliver such
Restricted  Material  Contract to Buyer,  and Buyer shall assume the obligations
under such  Restricted  Material  Contract  assigned to Buyer from and after the
date of  assignment  to  Buyer  pursuant  to a  special-purpose  assignment  and
assumption agreement  substantially  similar in terms to those of the Assignment
and  Assumption  Agreement  (which  special-purpose  agreement the parties shall
prepare,  execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer, all at
no additional cost to Buyer).

                (b)     If there are any  Consents  not listed  on  Exhibit  7.3
necessary for the assignment and transfer of any Seller  Contracts to Buyer (the
"Nonmaterial  Consents")  which have not yet been obtained (or otherwise are not
in full force and effect) as of the  Closing,  Buyer shall elect at the Closing,
in the  case  of each of the  Seller  Contracts  as to  which  such  Nonmaterial
Consents  were not obtained (or otherwise are not in full force and effect) (the
"Restricted Nonmaterial Contracts"), whether to:

                (i)     accept the  assignment  of  such  Restricted Nonmaterial
         Contract,  in which case, as between Buyer and Seller,  such Restricted
         Nonmaterial  Contract  shall,  to the maximum  extent  practicable  and
         notwithstanding  the  failure  to  obtain  the  applicable  Nonmaterial
         Consent,  be transferred at the Closing  pursuant to the Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement as elsewhere provided under this Agreement; or

                (ii)    reject  the assignment of  such  Restricted  Nonmaterial
         Contract,  in which case,  notwithstanding  Sections  2.1 and 2.4,  (A)
         neither this Agreement nor the Assignment and Assumption  Agreement nor
         any other  document  related to the  consummation  of the  Contemplated
         Transactions   shall   constitute  a  sale,   assignment,   assumption,
         conveyance or delivery or an attempted  sale,  assignment,  assumption,
         transfer,   conveyance  or  delivery  of  such  Restricted  Nonmaterial
         Contract,  and (B) Seller  shall  retain  such  Restricted  Nonmaterial
         Contract and all Liabilities arising therefrom or relating thereto.

                        (a)     Seller owns good and  marketable  title  to  its
respective estates in the Land, free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than:

                        (i)     liens for Taxes for the current  tax  year which
                are not yet due and payable; and

                        (ii)    those described in  Exhibit 3.7  ("Real   Estate

constituting  any  Real  Estate  Encumbrances  will be made  available  to Buyer
promptly.  Seller warrants to Buyer that, at the time of Closing, the Land shall

good faith. No claim has been made or is expected to be made by any Governmental
Body in a jurisdiction  where Seller does not file Tax Returns that it is or may
be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no Encumbrances on any of
the Assets that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay
any Tax, and Seller has no  knowledge  of any basis for  assertion of any claims
attributable to Taxes which, if adversely  determined,  would result in any such
Encumbrance.

         or will be duly  withheld,  deducted and  collected  and, to the extent
         required,  have  been  paid to the  proper  Governmental  Body or other
         Person.

                an owner by reason of the existence of a source of contamination

                restoration  funding  from  the  Inland  Protection  Trust  Fund
                pursuant  to  Chapter  376,  Florida  Statutes,  in  advance  of

                ranking  established by the Florida  Department of Environmental
                Protection,  Buyer may  request an  assignment  by Seller of all
                rights to  reimbursement  from the Inland  Protection Trust Fund
                for such site and  proceed  with  rehabilitation.  Seller  shall

                (ii)    any  title  exception is  disclosed in Schedule B to any
         Title  Commitment  that  is  not  one  of  the  Permitted  Real  Estate
         Encumbrances  or one that Seller  specifies  when  delivering the Title

Buyer suffers Material Damages as a result of a  misrepresentation  with respect
to the condition of title to the Land.

9.       Termination

         9.1    Termination Events

         By notice given  prior to or  at  the  Closing, subject to Section 9.2,

         (a)    by Buyer if a material Breach of any provision of this Agreement

         (b)    by  Seller  if  a  material  Breach  of  any provision  of  this
Agreement  has been  committed  by Buyer and such  Breach has not been waived by
Seller;

         (c)    by Buyer if any condition in Article 7 has not been satisfied as
of the date  specified  for  Closing in the first  sentence of Section 2.6 or if
satisfaction  of such a condition by such date is or becomes  impossible  (other
than  through  the failure of Buyer to comply  with its  obligations  under this
Agreement), and Buyer has not waived such condition on or before such date;

         (d)    by Seller if any condition in Article 8  has not been  satisfied
as of the date  specified for Closing in the first sentence of Section 2.6 or if
satisfaction  of such a condition by such date is or becomes  impossible  (other
than  through the failure of Seller to comply  with its  obligations  under this
Agreement), and Seller has not waived such condition on or before such date;

         (e)    by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller;

         (f)    by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or  before  December

         9.2    Effect Of Termination

         Each party's right of  termination under Section 9.1 is in  addition to
any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of such  right of  termination  will not be an  election  of  remedies.  If this
Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section 9.1, all obligations of the parties
under this Agreement will terminate,  except that the obligations of the parties
in this Section 9.2 and Articles 12 and 13 (except for

                                       46

<PAGE>

those in Section 13.5) will survive, provided,  however, that, if this Agreement
is terminated because of a Breach of this Agreement by the non-terminating party
or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating  party's obligations
under this  Agreement  is not  satisfied  as a result of the party's  failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement,  the terminating party's right
to  pursue  all  legal  remedies  will  survive  such  termination   unimpaired.
Furthermore,  notwithstanding any such termination, the Seller shall immediately
upon termination pay to the Buyer the Due Diligence Amount.

         Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable to the other in the event that
after the  execution  of this  Agreement  there  occurs (i) a change of law that
prevents the Closing, (ii) any action by a third party that prevents the Closing
or (iii) any order by a Governmental  Agency or court that prevents the Closing.
Both parties agree to diligently defend against a third party attempt to prevent
a Closing.

absence, including family medical leave, military leave, temporary disability or
sick leave, but excluding employees on long-term disability leave.

         (b)    Employment of Active Employees by Buyer.

                (i)     Buyer will make offers of  employment to  all  employees
         who meet the  standards  set forth on Exhibit  10.1(b) which Buyer will

         reasonable judgment and Buyer may interview all Active Employees. Buyer
         will provide  Seller with a list of Active  Employees to whom Buyer has
         made an offer of  employment  that has been accepted to be effective on
         the  Closing  Date (the  "Hired  Active  Employees").  Subject to Legal
         Requirements,  Buyer will have reasonable  access to the Facilities and
         personnel  Records  (including  performance  appraisals,   disciplinary
         actions,  grievances and medical  Records) of Seller for the purpose of
         preparing  for and  conducting  employment  interviews  with all Active
         Employees and will conduct the interviews as  expeditiously as possible
         prior to the  Closing  Date.  Access  will be  provided  by Seller upon
         reasonable  prior  notice  during  normal  business  hours.   Effective
         immediately before the Closing, Seller will terminate the employment of
         all Hired Active Employees.

                (ii)    Neither Seller nor its Related Persons shall solicit the
         continued employment of any Active Employee (unless and until Buyer has
         informed Seller

                                       47
<PAGE>

         in writing that the  particular  Active  Employee  will not receive any
         employment  offer from  Buyer) or the  employment  of any Hired  Active
         Employee after the Closing.  Buyer shall inform Seller  promptly of the
         identities  of  those  Active  Employees  to  whom  it  will  not  make
         employment  offers, and Seller shall assist Buyer in complying with the
         WARN Act as to those Active Employees.

                (iii)   It is understood and  agreed  that (A) Buyer's expressed
         intention to extend  offers of  employment as set forth in this section
         shall  not  constitute  any  commitment,   Contract  or   understanding
         (expressed  or  implied)  of any  obligation  on the part of Buyer to a
         post-Closing  employment  relationship of any fixed term or duration or
         upon any terms or conditions  other than those that Buyer may establish
         pursuant to individual offers of employment, and (B) employment offered
         by Buyer is "at will" and may be  terminated by Buyer or by an employee
         at any time for any reason  (subject to any written  commitments to the
         contrary made by Buyer or an employee and Legal Requirements).  Nothing
         in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any way the
         right of Buyer to  terminate,  reassign,  promote  or demote any of the
         Hired  Active  Employees  after the Closing or to change  adversely  or
         favorably  the  title,  powers,  duties,  responsibilities,  functions,
         locations,  salaries,  other  compensation  or terms or  conditions  of
         employment of such employees.

         (c)    Salaries and Benefits.

                (i)     Seller shall be  responsible for (A) the  payment of all
         wages and other  remuneration  due to Active  Employees with respect to
         their  services as employees of Seller through the close of business on
         the Closing Date,  including  pro rata bonus  payments and all vacation
         pay  earned  prior  to  the  Closing  Date;  (B)  the  payment  of  any
         termination  or  severance  payments  and the  provision of health plan
         continuation  coverage in accordance with the requirements of COBRA and
         Sections  601  through  608 of ERISA;  and (C) any and all  payments to
         employees required under the WARN Act.

                (ii)    Seller shall be liable for any claims  made or  incurred
         by Active  Employees and their  beneficiaries  through the Closing Date
         under the Employee  Plans.  For purposes of the  immediately  preceding
         sentence,  a claim will be deemed  incurred,  in the case of  hospital,
         medical or dental  benefits,  when the services that are the subject of
         the charge are performed  and, in the case of other  benefits  (such as
         disability  or life  insurance),  when an event has  occurred or when a
         condition has been diagnosed that entitles the employee to the benefit.

         (d)    No Transfer of Assets.  Neither  Seller nor its  Related Persons
will any transfer of pension or other employee benefit plan assets to Buyer.

         (e)    Terms of Employment. Buyer  will set  its own initial  terms and
conditions of employment for the Hired Active  Employees and others it may hire,

such terms and  conditions  shall be in the aggregate  substantially  similar in
value to the terms and  conditions  of such  Hired  Active  Employees  under the
Seller's  employ as disclosed to Buyer herein.  Buyer is not obligated to assume
any  collective  bargaining  agreements  under this  Agreement.  Seller shall be
solely liable for any severance payment required to be made to its employees due
to the Contemplated  Transactions.  Any bargaining obligations of Buyer with any
union with  respect to  bargaining  unit  employees  subsequent  to the Closing,
whether such  obligations  arise before or after the Closing,  shall be the sole
responsibility of Buyer.

         (f)    General Employee Provisions.

                (i)     Seller and Buyer shall  give  any  notices -required  by

                (ii)    Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such plan
         documents  and  summary  plan  descriptions,  employee  data  or  other
         information as may be reasonably required to carry out the arrangements
         described in this Section 10.1.

                (iii)   If any of the arrangements  described  in  this  Section
         10.1  are  determined  by the  IRS or  other  Governmental  Body  to be
         prohibited by law,  Seller and Buyer shall modify such  arrangements to
         as closely as possible  reflect their  expressed  intent and retain the
         allocation of economic benefits and burdens to the parties contemplated
         herein in a manner that is not prohibited by law.

                (iv)    Seller shall provide Buyer with  completed 1-9 forms and
         attachments with respect to all Hired Active Employees, except for such
         employees as Seller  certifies in writing to Buyer are exempt from such
         requirement.

                (v)     Buyer shall not  have  any  responsibility, liability or
         obligation,  whether  to  Active  Employees,  former  employees,  their
         beneficiaries  or to any other  Person,  with  respect to any  employee
         benefit  plans,  practices,  programs or  arrangements  (including  the
         establishment,  operation or termination  thereof and the  notification
         and provision of COBRA coverage extension) maintained by Seller.

                (vi)    Seller  will  require  certain  assistance from  certain
         Hired Active Employees to process  post-Closing  obligations of Seller,
         including,  but not limited to, filings with the Florida Public Service
         Commission  and other  regulatory  agencies  and  federal  wage and tax
         filings (collectively the "Post-Closing Obligations"), and Buyer agrees
         to provide the services of such  necessary  employees to assist  Seller
         with  its   Post-Closing   Obligations.   Such  assistance   shall  not
         unreasonably interfere with the necessary employees' regular duties for
         Buyer.

                                       49

         As  consideration  to Buyer for assistance  with Seller's  Post-Closing
         Obligations,  Seller shall pay Buyer the sum of Fifty Thousand  Dollars
         ($50,000.00), which sum shall be credited to Buyer at the Closing.

         10.2   Payment of all Taxes Resulting From Sale of Assets by Seller

         Seller shall pay in a timely manner all Taxes resulting from or payable

         In addition to payment of Taxes pursuant to  Section 10.2, Seller shall
pay, or make  adequate  provision  for the payment,  in full all of the Retained
Liabilities and other  Liabilities of Seller under this  Agreement.  If any such
Liabilities are not so paid or provided for, or if Buyer  reasonably  determines
that  failure to make any payments  will impair  Buyer's use or enjoyment of the
Assets or  conduct  of the  business  previously  conducted  by Seller  with the
Assets,  Buyer may,  upon ten (10) days  notice,  at any time after the  Closing
Date, elect to make all such payments  directly (but shall have no obligation to
do so) and set off and  deduct  the full  amount of all such  payments  from the
first maturing installments of the unpaid principal balance of the Note pursuant
to  Section  11.8.  Buyer  shall  receive  full  credit  under the Note and this
Agreement for all payments so made.

         10.4   Removing Excluded Assets

         Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller  shall remove all
Excluded  Assets  (other than the Capital  Charges  provided  for in Section 2.2
hereof) from all Facilities and other Land to be occupied by Buyer. Such removal
shall be done in such manner as to avoid any damage to the  Facilities and other
properties to be occupied by Buyer and any disruption of the business operations
to be conducted  by Buyer after the Closing.  Any damage to the Assets or to the
Facilities  resulting  from such removal shall be paid by Seller.  Should Seller
fail to remove the Excluded Assets as required by this Section, Buyer shall have
the right, but not the obligation, (a) to remove the Excluded Assets at Seller's
sole cost and expense; (b) to store the Excluded Assets and to charge Seller all
storage  costs  associated  therewith;  (c) to  treat  the  Excluded  Assets  as
unclaimed  and to  proceed  to  dispose  of the same  under  the laws  governing
unclaimed  property;  or (d) to exercise any other right or remedy  conferred by
this Agreement or otherwise available at law or in equity. Seller shall promptly
reimburse Buyer for all costs and expenses  incurred by Buyer in connection with
any Excluded Assets not removed by Seller on or before the Closing Date.

         Seller shall promptly after the Closing  prepare and  file all  reports
and returns required by Legal Requirements relating to the business of Seller as
conducted using the Assets, to and including the Effective Time.

         10.6   Assistance in Proceedings

         Seller will cooperate with  Buyer and  its counsel  in the  contest  or
defense of, and make  available  its  personnel  and provide any  testimony  and
access to its books and Records in connection with, any Proceeding  involving or
relating  to (a)  any  Contemplated  Transaction  or (b) any  action,  activity,
circumstance,  condition,  conduct,  event,  fact,  failure  to  act,  incident,
occurrence,  plan, practice,  situation,  status or transaction on or before the
Closing Date involving Seller or its business or either Shareholder.

         10.7   Retention of and Access to Records

         After the Closing Date, Buyer shall retain for a period consistent with
Buyer's  record-retention   policies  and  practices  those  Records  of  Seller
delivered to Buyer.  Buyer also shall provide  Seller and their  Representatives
reasonable  access  thereto,  during  normal  business  hours to enable  them to
prepare financial  statements or tax returns or deal with tax audits.  After the
Closing  Date,  Seller shall provide  Buyer and its  Representatives  reasonable
access to Records that are Excluded Assets, during normal business hours for any
reasonable business purpose specified by Buyer in such notice.

         10.8   Further Assurances

         Subject to the  proviso in  Section 6.1, the  parties  shall  cooperate
reasonably  with  each  other  and  with  their  respective  Representatives  in
connection  with any  steps  required  to be  taken as part of their  respective
obligations  under this  Agreement,  and shall (a) furnish  upon request to each
other such further information; (b) execute and deliver to each other such other
documents;  and (c) do such other acts and  things,  all as the other  party may
reasonably  request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions.

11.      Indemnification; Remedies

         11.1   Survival

         All  representations, warranties, covenants  and  obligations in   this
Agreement,  the  certificates  delivered  pursuant  to Section 2.7 and any other
certificate or document  delivered  pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Closing  and the  consummation  of the  Contemplated  Transactions,  subject  to

warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be affected by any investigation
(including any environmental investigation or assessment) conducted with respect
to, or any Knowledge acquired at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,  warranty, covenant
or  obligation.  The  waiver of any  condition  based upon the  accuracy  of any
representation  or warranty,  or on the  performance  of or compliance  with any
covenant  or  obligation,   will  not  affect  the  right  to   indemnification,
reimbursement  or other  remedy  based  upon such  representations,  warranties,
covenants and obligations. For purposes of this Article 11, whenever the phrases
"to Seller's knowledge",  "to the best of Seller's knowledge", "to the knowledge
of  Seller",   or  any  similar  phrase,   or  whenever  the  words  "material",
"materially"  are used in this  Agreement  (other than in this Article 11), such
words and phrases  shall be  disregarded  for  purposes  of this  Article 11 and
indemnification  hereunder as if such words or phrases were  stricken  from this
Agreement.

         11.2   Indemnification and Reimbursement by Seller

         Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, and its Representatives,
shareholders,   subsidiaries  and  Related  Persons  (collectively,  the  "Buyer
Indemnified Persons"),  and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any
loss,  liability,  claim, damage,  expense (including costs of investigation and
defense and  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and  expenses) or diminution of value,
whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim (collectively,  "Damages") (but not
including any Damages  covered by the offsets for the Remedial  Capital  Project
Amount), arising from or in connection with:

                (a)     any Breach of any representation  or  warranty  made  by
Seller in (i) this Agreement (without giving effect to any supplement  thereto),
(ii) the certificates  delivered pursuant to Section 2.7 (for this purpose, each
such certificate will be deemed to have stated that Seller's representations and
warranties in this Agreement  fulfill the  requirements of Section 7.1 as of the
Closing  Date  as if made on the  Closing  Date  without  giving  effect  to any
supplement  thereto,  unless the certificate  expressly  states that the matters
disclosed in a supplement  have caused a condition  specified in Section 7.1 not
to be  satisfied),  (v) any transfer  instrument or (vi) any other  certificate,
document, writing or instrument delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

                (b)     any Breach of any covenant or  obligation  of  Seller in
this  Agreement or in any other  certificate,  document,  writing or  instrument
delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement;

                (c)     any Liability  arising out of the ownership or operation
of the Assets prior to the Effective Time other than the Assumed Liabilities;

                (d)     any brokerage or finder's fees or commissions or similar
payments

                                       52
<PAGE>

based upon any agreement or understanding made, or alleged to have been made, by
any Person with Seller (or any Person acting on its behalf) in  connection  with
any of the Contemplated Transactions;

                (e)     any liability  under the WARN Act or any  similar  state
or local Legal Requirement that may result from an "Employment Loss", as defined
by 29  U.S.C.  sect.  2101(a)(6),  caused by any  action of Seller  prior to the
Closing or by Buyer's decision not to hire previous employees of Seller;

                (f)     any Employee Plan established or maintained by Seller;
or

                (g)     any Retained Liabilities.

                Notwithstanding anything  contained in  this  Agreement  to  the
contrary,  the Buyer will not have the right to sue the Seller for Damages which
result  form a defect in the title to the Real  Property  obtained  by the Buyer
pursuant  to this  Agreement  for  which  there is  applicable  title  insurance
pursuant to Section 5.9 hereof and on which a claim may be made by the Buyer for
the relevant  Damages  unless (a) the Buyer has filed a claim under the relevant
title insurance  policy and the claim has not been allowed within 90 days of the
date the claim was filed or (b) the Buyer has filed a claim  under the  relevant
title insurance policy, the claim was allowed within 90 days after the filing of
the claim but the  processing  or  defending  (or the  taking of other  relevant
action in accordance with the claim by the Title Insurer) is not proceeding in a
satisfactory manner as determined by the Buyer in the exercise of its reasonable
judgment.

         11.3   Indemnification and Reimbursement by Seller--Environmental
Matters

         In addition to the other indemnification provisions in this Article 11,
Seller will  indemnify and hold harmless  Buyer and the other Buyer  indemnified
Persons,  and will reimburse Buyer and the other Buyer Indemnified  Persons, for
any Damages  (including  costs of  cleanup,  containment  or other  remediation)
arising from or in connection with:

                (a)     any Environmental, Health and Safety Liabilities arising
out of or relating to: (i) the  ownership or operation by any Person at any time
on or prior to the Closing Date of any of the Facilities, assets or the business
of Seller,  or (ii) any  Hazardous  Materials  or other  contaminants  that were
present on the Facilities or Assets at any time on or prior to the Closing Date;
or

                (b)     any  bodily injury (including  illness,  disability  and
death,  regardless  of when any such bodily  injury  occurred,  was  incurred or
manifested  itself),  personal  injury,  property  damage  (including  trespass,
nuisance,  wrongful  eviction and  deprivation  of the use of real  property) or
other  damage of or to any  Person  or any  Assets  in any way  arising  from or
allegedly  arising  from any  Hazardous  Activity  conducted  by any Person

                                       53
<PAGE>

with  respect to the  business of Seller or the Assets prior to the Closing Date
or from any  Hazardous  Material  that was (i)  present on or before the Closing
Date  on or at the  Facilities  (or  present  on any  other  property,  if  such
Hazardous  Material  emanated or  allegedly  emanated  from any Facility and was
present on any  Facility,  on or prior to the Closing  Date) or (ii) Released or
allegedly  Released by any Person on or at any  Facilities or Assets at any time
on or prior to the Closing Date.

         Buyer,   with  Seller's  consent  and   approval  which  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld  will be  entitled to control any  Remedial  Action,  any
Proceeding  relating to an  Environmental  Claim and,  except as provided in the
following sentence,  any other Proceeding with respect to which indemnity may be
sought under this Section  11.3.  The  procedure  described in Section 11.9 will
apply to any claim solely for monetary  damages  relating to a matter covered by
this Section 11.3.

         No  claim for environmental  indemnification  or reimbursement  may  be
asserted  unless the  underlying  environmental  condition  is (i)  specifically
identified  in Exhibit 3.13 or (ii) the party  asserting  the claim  establishes
that the conditions,  release,  disposal or actions giving rise to the liability
or claim were  present at or prior to Closing and that the party  asserting  the
claim did not materially cause or contribute to such conditions after Closing.

         11.4   Indemnification and Reimbursement by Buyer

         Buyer  will  indemnify  and  hold  harmless  Seller, and will reimburse
Seller, for any Damages arising from or in connection with:

Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate,  document,  writing or instrument
delivered by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

                (b)     any Breach of any  covenant or obligation  of  Buyer  in
this  Agreement or in any other  certificate,  document,  writing or  instrument

                (c)     any claim by any Person for  brokerage or finder's  fees
or  commissions or similar  payments  based upon any agreement or  understanding
alleged to have been made by such  Person  with  Buyer (or any Person  acting on
Buyer's behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions; or

                (d)     any Assumed Liabilities.

         11.5   Limitations on Amount--Seller

          Seller shall have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with
respect to claims  under  Section  11.2(a)  until the total of all Damages  with
respect to such matters  exceeds  $500,000 and then only for the amount by which
such  Damages  exceed  $500,000.  However,  this  Section 11.5 will not apply to
claims under (the following,  each an "Exempted Breach") Section 11.2(b) through
(h) or to  matters  arising in respect of  Sections  3.7,  3.13,  or 3.15 to any
Breach of any of Seller's representations and warranties of which the Seller had
Knowledge  at any  time  prior  to the date on  which  such  representation  and
warranty  is made  or any  Breach  by  Seller  of any  covenant  or  obligation.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Seller shall not be liable for Minor Claims
(as hereinafter defined) until such Minor Claims aggregate more than $500,000 in
which case,  Seller  shall be liable for all Minor  Claims to the extent that in
the aggregate  they exceed  $500,000  provided that Damages in aggregate  exceed
$500,000.  "Minor Claim" means Damages resulting from a Breach hereof covered by
Section 11.2(a) (other than an Exempted Breach) that do not exceed $20,000.00.

         11.6   Limitations on Amount--Buyer

         Buyer will  have no liability  (for  indemnification or otherwise) with
respect to claims  under  Section  11.4(a)  until the total of all Damages  with
respect to such matters  exceeds  $500,000 and then only for the amount by which
such  Damages  exceed  $500,000.  However,  this  Section 11.6 will not apply to
claims  under  Section  11.4(b)  through  (e) or  matters  arising in respect of
Section 4.4 or to any Breach of any of Buyer's representations and warranties of
which  Buyer  had  Knowledge  at any  time  prior  to the  date  on  which  such
representation  and  warranty is made or any Breach by Buyer of any  covenant or
obligation,  and Buyer  will be liable  for all  Damages  with  respect  to such
Breaches.

         11.7   Time Limitations

                (a)     If  the Closing  occurs, Seller will have liability (for
indemnification  or  otherwise)  with respect to any Breach of (i) a covenant or
obligation  to be  performed  or complied  with prior to the Closing Date (other
than those in  Sections  2.1 and 2.4(b)  and  Articles  10 and 12, as to which a
claim may be made at any time, or (ii) a representation  or warranty (other than
one  contained  in Section 3.12 or 3.13 hereof) only if on or before three years
after the Closing Date,  Buyer notifies Seller of a claim specifying the factual
basis of the claim in  reasonable  detail to the extent then known by Buyer.  If
the  Closing  occurs,   Seller  will  have  liability  (for  indemnification  or
otherwise)  with  respect to any Breach of the  representations  and  warranties
contained  in Section  3.12 or 3.13 hereof only if on or before five years after
the Closing Date,  the Buyer notifies  Seller of a claim  specifying the factual
basis of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer.

                                       55
<PAGE>

                (b)     If the Closing occurs, Buyer  will  have  liability (for
indemnification  or  otherwise)  with respect to any Breach of (i) a covenant or
obligation  to be  performed  or complied  with prior to the Closing Date (other
than those in Article 12, as to which a claim may be made at any time) or (ii) a
representation  or  warranty  (other  than that set forth in Section  4.4, as to
which a claim may be made at any time),  only if on or before  three years after
the Closing Date,  Seller notifies Buyer of a claim specifying the factual basis
of the claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Seller.

         11.8   Right Of Setoff

         Upon  notice  to  Seller  specifying  in  reasonable detail  the  basis
therefor,  Buyer may set off any amount to which it may be  entitled  under this
Article 11 against  amounts  otherwise  payable to Seller,  subject to  Seller's
right to object under the Dispute Resolution Process. The exercise of such right
of setoff by Buyer in good faith,  whether or not  ultimately  determined  to be
justified,  will not constitute an event of default. Neither the exercise of nor
the  failure  to  exercise  such  right of setoff or to give a notice of a claim
under the Escrow  Agreement  will  constitute  an  election of remedies or limit
Buyer  in any  manner  in the  enforcement  of any  other  remedies  that may be
available to it.

         11.9   Third-Party Claims

                (a)     Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity
under Section 11.2, 11.3 (to the extent provided in the last sentence of Section
11.3)  or 11.4  (an  "Indemnified  Person")  of  notice  of the  assertion  of a
Third-Party  Claim against it, such Indemnified  Person shall give notice to the
Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an  "Indemnifying  Person") of
the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying  Person will not relieve the  Indemnifying  Person of any liability
that it may  have to any  Indemnified  Person,  except  to the  extent  that the
Indemnifying  Person  demonstrates that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is
prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.

                (b)     If  an   Indemnified   Person   gives   notice  to   the
Indemnifying   Person  pursuant  to  Section  11.9(a)  of  the  assertion  of  a
Third-Party  Claim, the Indemnifying  Person shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Third-Party  Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless
(i) the Indemnifying  Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim
is  made  and  the  Indemnified  Person  determines  in good  faith  that  joint
representation  would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying  Person fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity
to defend such  Third-Party  Claim and provide  indemnification  with respect to
such Third-Party  Claim),  to assume the defense of such Third-Party  Claim with
counsel   satisfactory  to  the  Indemnified  Person.   After  notice  from  the
Indemnifying  Person to the  Indemnified  Person of its  election  to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as
it diligently  conducts such defense,  be liable to the

                                       56

<PAGE>

Indemnified  Person under this  Article 11 for any fees of other  counsel or any
other expenses with respect to the defense of such  Third-Party  Claim,  in each
case  subsequently  incurred by the  Indemnified  Person in connection  with the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation.
If the Indemnifying  Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such
assumption will  conclusively  establish for purposes of this Agreement that the
claims  made in that  Third-Party  Claim are within the scope of and  subject to
indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims
may be effected by the  Indemnifying  Person  without the  Indemnified  Person's
Consent  unless (A) there is no finding or admission  of any  violation of Legal
Requirement  or any  violation of the rights of any Person;  (B) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the  Indemnifying  Person;
and (C) the  Indemnified  Person  shall have no  liability  with  respect to any
compromise  or  settlement  of such  Third-Party  Claims  effected  without  its
Consent.  If notice is given to an  Indemnifying  Person of the assertion of any
Third-Party  Claim and the  Indemnifying  Person does not,  within ten (10) days
after the Indemnified  Person's notice is given,  give notice to the Indemnified
Person of its  election to assume the  defense of such  Third-Party  Claim,  the
Indemnifying  Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party
Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.

                (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an  Indemnified Person
determines  in  good  faith  that  there  is a  reasonable  probability  that  a
Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a
result of monetary  damages  for which it would be  entitled to  indemnification
under this Agreement,  the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying
Person,  assume  the  exclusive  right to  defend,  compromise  or  settle  such
Third-Party  Claim,  but  the  Indemnifying  Person  will  not be  bound  by any
determination  of any  Third-Party  Claim so defended  for the  purposes of this
Agreement or any  compromise or settlement  effected  without its Consent (which
may not be unreasonably withheld).

                (d)     Notwithstanding the  provisions of Section 13.4,  Seller
and each  Shareholder  hereby consent to the  nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any
court in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against
any Buyer Indemnified  Person for purposes of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified
Person may have under this  Agreement  with  respect to such  Proceeding  or the
matters  alleged  therein  and agree  that  process  may be served on Seller and
Shareholders with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.

                (e)     With   respect  to  any  Third-Party  Claim  subject  to
indemnification  under this Article 11: (i) both the Indemnified  Person and the
Indemnifying  Person,  as the case may be,  shall  keep the other  Person  fully
informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related  Proceedings at
all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel,  and
(ii) the parties  agree  (each at its own  expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to

                                       57
<PAGE>

cooperate  in good  faith  with each  other in order to ensure  the  proper  and
adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.

                (f)     With  respect  to  any  Third-Party   Claim  subject  to
indemnification  under this Article 11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a
manner as to preserve in full (to the extent  possible) the  confidentiality  of
all   Confidential   Information  and  the   attorney-client   and  work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its
Best  Efforts,  in respect of any  Third-Party  Claim in which it has assumed or
participated in the defense,  to avoid  production of  Confidential  Information
(consistent  with  applicable  law  and  rules  of  procedure),   and  (ii)  all
communications   between  any  party  hereto  and  counsel  responsible  for  or
participating  in the  defense of any  Third-Party  Claim  shall,  to the extent
possible,  be  made  so  as  to  preserve  any  applicable   attorney-client  or
work-product privilege.

         11.10  Other Claims

         A claim for indemnification for any  matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought
and shall be paid  promptly  after such  notice,  subject to filing an objection
under the Dispute Resolution Process.

         11.11  Buyer Benefit

         Upon any termination of this Agreement  that would entitle the Buyer to
recover the benefit of its bargain  with the Seller,  the Buyer and Seller agree
that the value of the  benefit of the  bargain is  speculative,  is not  readily
subject to determination  objectively and agree that the value of the benefit of
the bargain to the Buyer is $5 Million,  plus an amount equal to all transaction
costs  which the  Buyer  would  have paid if the  Closing  and  issuance  of the
Acquisition Bonds had taken place.

12.      Confidentiality

Seller, on the other hand) or its Representatives  (collectively,  a "Disclosing
Party") to the other party or its  Representatives  (collectively,  a "Receiving
Party"):

                (i)     all information that is a  trade secret under applicable

         software   and   database   technologies,   systems,   structures   and
         architectures;

                (iii)   all information concerning the  business and affairs  of

considered  Confidential  Information of that  Disclosing  Party for purposes of
this Article 12 to the extent  included  within the  definition.  In the case of

Contact") or an authorized  representative of Buyer with respect to Confidential
Information of Buyer (each, a "Buyer  Contact").  Each of Buyer and Seller

                                       59
<PAGE>

shall  disclose  the  Confidential  Information  of the other  party only to its
Representatives  who require  such  material for the purpose of  evaluating  the
Contemplated  Transactions  and are  informed by Buyer or Seller as the case may
be, of the obligations of this Article 12 with respect to such information. Each
of Buyer and Seller  shall (iv)  enforce the terms of this  Article 12 as to its
respective  Representatives;  (v) take such  action to the extent  necessary  to
cause its  Representatives  to comply  with the  terms  and  conditions  of this

Assumed Liabilities.

         12.3   Exceptions

         Sections 12.2(a) and (b) do not  apply to that part of the Confidential
Information of a Disclosing  Party that a Receiving Party  demonstrates (a) was,
is or becomes  generally  available  to the  public  other than as a result of a
breach of this  Article 12 or the  Confidentiality  Agreement  by the  Receiving
Party or its  Representatives;  (b) was or is developed by the  Receiving  Party
independently of and without  reference to any  Confidential  Information of the
Disclosing  Party; or (c) was, is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on
a  nonconfidential  basis  from a Third  Party  not  bound by a  confidentiality
agreement or any legal,  fiduciary or other obligation  restricting  disclosure.
Seller shall not disclose any Confidential Information of Seller relating to any
of the Assets or the  Assumed  Liabilities  in  reliance  on the  exceptions  in
clauses (b) or (c) above.

         12.4   Legal Proceedings

         If  a Receiving  Party  becomes  compelled  in  any  Proceeding  or  is
requested  by a  Governmental  Body  having  regulatory  jurisdiction  over  the
Contemplated Transactions to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise
constrained  by  this  Article  12,  that  Receiving  Party  shall  provide  the
Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such compulsion or request so that it may
seek an  appropriate  protective  order or  other  appropriate  remedy  or waive
compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Article  12.  In the  absence  of a
protective order or other remedy,  the Receiving Party may disclose that

                                       60
<PAGE>

portion  (and  only  that  portion)  of  the  Confidential  Information  of  the
Disclosing Party that, based upon advice of the Receiving  Party's counsel,  the
Receiving  Party is legally  compelled to disclose or that has been requested by
such Governmental Body,  provided,  however,  that the Receiving Party shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded by any Person to whom any Confidential  Information is so disclosed.
The provisions of this Section 12.4 do not apply to any Proceedings  between the
parties to this Agreement.

         12.5   Return or Destruction of Confidential Information

         If this Agreement is terminated, each Receiving Party shall (a) destroy
all  Confidential  Information of the Disclosing  Party prepared or generated by
the Receiving Party without retaining a copy of any such material;  (b) promptly
deliver  to the  Disclosing  Party all  other  Confidential  Information  of the
Disclosing Party,  together with all copies thereof, in the possession,  custody
or control of the Receiving Party or, alternatively, with the written consent of
a Seller Contact or a Buyer Contact (whichever  represents the Disclosing Party)
destroy all such Confidential Information;  and (c) certify all such destruction
in writing to the Disclosing Party, provided,  however, that the Receiving Party
may retain a list that contains  general  descriptions of the information it has
returned or destroyed to facilitate  the resolution of any  controversies  after
the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information is returned.

         12.6   Attorney-Client Privilege

         The Disclosing Party is not  waiving, and  will not  be  deemed to have
waived  or   diminished,   any  of  its  attorney   work  product   protections,
attorney-client  privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of
disclosing its  Confidential  Information  (including  Confidential  Information
related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party,  regardless
of whether  the  Disclosing  Party has  asserted,  or is or may be  entitled  to
assert,  such privileges and  protections.  The parties (a) share a common legal
and  commercial   interest  in  all  of  the  Disclosing  Party's   Confidential
Information that is subject to such privileges and  protections;  (b) are or may
become  joint  defendants  in  Proceedings  to  which  the  Disclosing   Party's
Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges relates; (c)
intend that such  privileges and  protections  remain intact should either party
become  subject to any actual or threatened  Proceeding to which the  Disclosing
Party's  Confidential  Information  covered by such  protections  and privileges
relates;  and (d) intend that after the Closing the  Receiving  Party shall have
the right to assert such  protections and  privileges.  No Receiving Party shall
admit,  claim or contend,  in Proceedings  involving  either party or otherwise,
that any Disclosing Party waived any of its attorney  work-product  protections,
attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges with respect to
any information,  documents or other material not disclosed to a Receiving Party
due to the Disclosing Party disclosing its Confidential  Information  (including
Confidential  Information  related to pending or threatened  litigation)  to the
Receiving Party.

         13.4   Jurisdiction; Service of Process

         Any  Proceeding  arising out of or  relating to this  Agreement or  any
Contemplated  Transaction  may be brought in the courts of the State of Florida,
County of  Escambia,  or, if it has or can acquire  jurisdiction,  in the United
States  District  Court for the  Northern  District of Florida,  and each of the
parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction of each such court in
any such Proceeding,  waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue
or to convenience of forum,  agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding
shall be heard and determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any
Proceeding  arising  out of or relating to this  Agreement  or any  Contemplated
Transaction  in any other court.  The parties  agree that either or both of them
may file a copy of this  paragraph  with any court as  written  evidence  of the
knowing,  voluntary and bargained  agreement between the parties  irrevocably to
waive  any  objections  to venue or to  convenience  of  forum.  Process  in any
Proceeding  referred to in the first  sentence of this  section may be served on
any party anywhere in the world.

         13.5   Enforcement of Agreement

                (a)     Notwithstanding any other provision in  this  Agreement,
any dispute among the parties which arises from the Agreement  shall be resolved
by binding  arbitration  conducted in accordance  with this Section  13.5.  (the
"Dispute  Resolution  Process") Either party may initiate the Dispute Resolution
Process by providing written notice to the other party.

                (b)     After  transmittal  and   receipt  of  a  written notice
specifying the area or areas of  disagreement  or dispute,  the parties agree to
meet at  reasonable  times and places,  as mutually  agreed upon, to discuss the
issues.

                (c)     If discussions between  the parties fail to  resolve the
dispute  within  fifteen (15)  business days of the receipt by each party of the
notice  described in subsection (a) of this Section 13.5, a binding  arbitration
may then be initiated by either party by written notification to the other party
of the  existence  of a  dispute.  Any  and all  issues  related  to the  matter
addressed by the written  notice  provided in subsection  (a) of Section 13.5 or
any  response  by the other  party  shall be  raised  and  resolved  in a single
proceeding.

                (d)     The arbitrators shall be appointed  and act  as follows:
(1) Each party shall  appoint a person as  arbitrator  within ten (10)  business
days of the date one of the parties has notified the other of the existence of a
dispute; (2) Each appointment shall be signified in writing to the counter party
and the  arbitrators so appointed,  within ten (10) days of their  acceptance of
appointment, shall appoint a third arbitrator, who shall chair the panel. If the
arbitrators  appointed  by  the  parties  are  unable  to  agree  upon  a  third
arbitrator,  the same shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association
from its qualified panel of arbitrators. Each party shall have the right to veto
up to two

                                       64
<PAGE>

appointments proposed by the American Arbitration  Association.  If either party
fails to appoint an  arbitrator  within ten (10) business days from the date one
of the parties has  notified the other of the  existence  of a dispute,  then an
arbitrator shall be appointed by the American  Arbitration  Association from its
qualified panel of arbitrators as the appointment of the party failing to timely
appoint and the two so appointed  shall appoint a third  arbitrator to chair the
panel. The party on whose behalf an arbitrator is appointed shall have the right
to veto  up to two of the  arbitrators  appointed  by the  American  Arbitration
Association;  (3) Nothing in this Section  6.04 shall  preclude the parties from
mutually  agreeing  to a  single  arbitrator  to  resolve  the  dispute;  (4) No
arbitrator  shall have a business or other  pecuniary  relationship  with either
party,  except for payment of arbitrator's fees and expenses without the written
consent of both parties.

                (e)     Arbitrators shall be  sworn to perform their duties with
impartiality  and  fidelity.  In rendering any decision,  the  arbitrator  shall
proceed to consider the Agreement,  the dispute identified in the notice and any
response  and the actions  taken and the  documentation  thereof,  conduct,  and
relative position,  knowledge, and the ability of the parties in relation to the
dispute.

                (f)     The arbitration  hearing shall  convene not earlier than
sixty  (60) days and not  later  than  ninety  (90)  days of the  acceptance  of
appointment of all of the  arbitrators  chosen by the parties unless the parties
mutually  agree to an earlier  date.  The  arbitrators  shall  render a decision
within  ten (10)  business  days of the date on which  the  arbitration  hearing
concludes,  and  such  decisions  shall  be in  writing  and in  duplicate,  one
counterpart thereof to be delivered  simultaneously to each of the parties.  The
decision  shall  contain  findings of fact and  conclusions  of law and shall be
final and binding upon the parties.

                (g)     The parties shall  be entitled  to discovery pursuant to
the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. All discovery requests by a party shall be
enforced by the arbitrators. The arbitration hearing shall not proceed until all
outstanding discovery requests have been fulfilled.

                (h)     The fees, charges and  expenses of  the arbitrators, any
experts  engaged  by the  arbitrators,  the  respective  counsel  engaged by the
parties,  and any witnesses called by the parties shall be paid as follows:  the
arbitrators  shall order each party to pay their own fees,  charges and expenses
and assess the fees, charges and expenses of the arbitrators equally between the
parties.

                (i)     The provisions of  the Florida Arbitration Code, Chapter
682,  Florida  Statutes,  and the Florida  Evidence  Code,  Chapter 90,  Florida
Statutes,  except  to the  extent  inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  this
Agreement,  shall specifically be deemed to apply to any arbitration  proceeding
conducted  hereunder.  Unless the venue is mutually agreed upon otherwise by the
parties, the venue for any arbitration  commenced pursuant to this Section shall
be in Pensacola, Florida.

         13.6   Waiver; Remedies Cumulative

         The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative
and  not  alternative.  Neither  any  failure  nor any  delay  by any  party  in
exercising  any right,  power or  privilege  under this  Agreement or any of the
documents  referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power or privilege,  and no single or partial exercise of any such right,  power
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum
extent  permitted by  applicable  law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this
Agreement  or  any  of  the  documents  referred  to in  this  Agreement  can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the
claim or right unless in writing  signed by the other party;  (b) no waiver that
may be given by a party will be applicable  except in the specific  instance for
which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to
be a waiver of any  obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving
such  notice  or  demand  to take  further  action  without  notice or demand as
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.

         13.7   Entire Agreement and Modification

         This Agreement supersedes  all  prior agreements,  whether  written  or
oral,  between the parties with  respect to its subject  matter  (including  any
letter of intent and any confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Seller) and
constitutes  (along with the  Disclosure  Letter,  Exhibits and other  documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive  statement of the
terms of the agreement  between the parties with respect to its subject  matter.
This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by
a written agreement executed by the party to be charged with the amendment.

         13.8   Assignments, Successors and no Third-Party Rights

         No  party  may   assign  any  of its  rights or  delegate  any  of  its
obligations  under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
parties,  except that Buyer may collaterally  assign its rights hereunder to any
financial  institution  providing  financing in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions.  Subject to the preceding sentence,  this Agreement will apply to,
be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the  successors  and
permitted  assigns of the  parties.  Nothing  expressed  or  referred to in this
Agreement  will be  construed  to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to
this Agreement or any provision of this  Agreement,  except such rights as shall
inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this Section 13.8.

         13.9   Severability

         If any provision of this Agreement is held  invalid or unenforceable by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will

unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the
extent not held invalid or unenforceable.

Sections of this Agreement.

         13.11  Time of Essence

this Agreement, time is of the essence.

         13.12  Governing Law

         This Agreement will be governed  by and construed under the laws of the
State of  Florida  without  regard to  conflicts-of-laws  principles  that would

         13.13  Execution of Agreement

         This  Agreement may be executed  in one or  more counterparts, each  of

as to the  parties  and may be used in lieu of the  original  Agreement  for all

         13.14  Due Diligence.

         This  Agreement  is  being executed  without  all of  its schedules and
Exhibits being attached.  As to the foregoing  which are documents,  the parties
hereto  agree to  negotiate  in good faith to  finalize  the form  thereof on or
before the Due Diligence Date (as hereinafter  defined). As to the Schedules and
other exhibits,  all  non-attached  schedules and exhibits are to be prepared by
the Seller.  During the course of preparing  such  schedules and  exhibits,  the
Seller will give to the Buyer drafts  thereof as  developed  and supply to Buyer
such  information,  and  permit  the Buyer to  conduct  such due  diligence,  in
connection therewith as Buyer shall reasonably request. In addition, Seller

                                       67
<PAGE>

acknowledges  that Buyer has not conducted the due diligence  that Buyer desires
to  conduct  prior  to  consummating  the  transactions   contemplated   hereby.
Consequently,  at such time as Seller completes the schedules and exhibits it is
required to complete to be attached hereto, it shall deliver to Buyer a complete
set thereof with a written  notice  stating that the  schedules  and exhibits so
delivered  are the final  schedules  and exhibits  hereto that it is required to
complete and deliver. The date of the foregoing, the "Exhibit Delivery Date". If
the Exhibit  Delivery Date has not occurred on or prior to thirty days after the
date  hereof or, if they are so  delivered  prior  thereto  but the Buyer in the
exercise  of its  reasonable  discretion  is not  satisfied  with the  substance
thereof,  the Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement except that
the Seller shall  immediately pay to the Buyer the Due Diligence  Expenses.  The
Buyer agrees that it will in good faith seek to accomplish  its due diligence on
or before six (6) weeks after the Exhibit  Delivery Date.  When it has completed
its due diligence,  it shall notify the Seller. If the Buyer is not satisfied in
its reasonable discretion with the results of its due diligence,  then the Buyer
may terminate this Agreement except that the Seller shall immediately pay to the
Buyer  the Due  Diligence  Expenses.  If the  Buyer  has not  completed  its due
diligence  within  the  aforesaid  time,  then the  Seller  may  terminate  this
Agreement or if the expenses of the Buyer in  conducting  its due  diligence are
reasonably  projected  by Buyer at any time to exceed  $150,000  and the  Seller
refuses  to  approve  the  reasonable  projected  amount  over  $150,000  as Due
Diligence Expenses as defined herein and subject to reimbursement by the Seller,
then the Buyer may terminate this Agreement, and, in each case, the Seller shall
pay to the Buyer the Due Diligence Expense.

         13.15  RADON GAS.

                (a)     RADON IS  NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE GAS THAT, WHEN
IT HAS  ACCUMULATED IN A BUILDING IN SUFFICIENT  QUANTITIES,  MAY PRESENT HEALTH
RISKS TO PERSONS  WHO ARE  EXPOSED TO IT OVER TIME.  LEVELS OF RADON THAT EXCEED
FEDERAL AND STATE GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN BUILDINGS IN FLORIDA. ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION  REGARDING  RADON  TESTING  MAY BE OBTAINED  FROM THE COUNTY  PUBLIC
HEALTH UNIT.

         13.16  Limited Liability.

         Neither  the  State  of  Florida  nor  any   political  subdivision  or
municipality  thereof,  nor the Buyer, shall be obligated (1) to exercise its ad
valorem  taxing  power  or any  other  taxing  power  in any form on any real or
personal  property to pay any  liability  arising  out of, or in any  connection
whatsoever  with,  this  Agreement,  or to pay the  principal of the  Acquistion
Bonds,  the interest  thereon or other costs incident  thereto or (2) to pay the
same from any other funds,  except from the Net  Revenues  realized by the Buyer
from its  ownership or operation of the System,  junior and  subordinate  to the
payment  of any Bonds or other  indebtedness  payable  from such  source.  It is
further  agreed  between  the

                                       68
<PAGE>

Buyer  and the  Seller  that  this  Agreement  and any  obligations  arising  in
connection  therewith,  whether for payment of the  Purchase  Price,  or for any
claim of liability, remedy for breach, or otherwise, shall not constitute a lien
on the System or any other property of the Authority,  or any municipality,  but
shall constitute a lien only on the Pledged Revenues,  in the manner provided in
this Agreement.

         Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary  contained herein  or in any
other instrument or document executed by or on behalf of the Buyer in connection
