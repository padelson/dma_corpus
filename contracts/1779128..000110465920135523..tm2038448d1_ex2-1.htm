Acquiror has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required in connection with the Subscription Agreements that

the PIPE Investors have, complied with all of their respective obligations under the Subscription Agreements. There are no conditions

as expressly set forth in the Subscription Agreements. To the Knowledge of the Acquiror, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to (i)&nbsp;constitute a default or

Acquiror has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the consummation of the purchases under the Subscription Agreements

reasonably be expected to cause such conditions not to be satisfied.</P>

of the Company Group, nor shall it be construed as giving any Participant any rights to continued service on the Board. The Service
Recipient or any other member of the Company Group may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or discontinue any consulting
relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or any Award
Agreement. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant shall thereby be deemed to have waived any claim to continued exercise
or vesting of an Award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation of the Award beyond the period provided
under the Plan or any Award Agreement, except to the extent of any provision to the contrary in any written employment contract
or other agreement between the Service Recipient and/or any member of the Company Group and the Participant, whether any such agreement

</FONT></FONT>Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the
Investor Rights Agreement or any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock, the total number of
directors shall be determined from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The directors (other
than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one
or more other such series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II and Class
III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors. Class&nbsp;I directors
shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company&rsquo;s annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2021, Class&nbsp;II directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the
Company&rsquo;s annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December&nbsp;31, 2022 and Class&nbsp;III directors
shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company&rsquo;s annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2023. Commencing with the annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December&nbsp;31,
2021, the directors of the class to be elected at each annual meeting shall be elected for a three year term. If the number of
such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors
in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship
resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class,
but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director
shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of Directors
is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to their respective class.</P>

(whether by death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause) may be filled by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director or by the stockholders.
Any director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until the next election of the class for
which such director shall have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.</P>

another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy in any manner provided by applicable law, but no such proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law
to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and
voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a
later date. Unless required by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, or determined by the chairman of the
meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by
the stockholder voting, or by such stockholder&rsquo;s proxy, if there be such proxy. When a quorum is present or represented
at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless
the question is one upon which, by express provision of applicable law, of the rules&nbsp;or regulations of any stock
exchange applicable to the Corporation, of any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, of the Certificate
of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and
