Article III 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

  



  

3.01   _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, without any
action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, any Company
Stockholders or any holder of Company Options:

  



  

(a)  Each Company Common Share (including each Company
Restricted Share) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.01(e)_), shall thereupon be canceled and automatically converted into and
deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive a number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Closing Per Share Stock
Consideration, in accordance with the information set forth in the Spreadsheet
(as updated, to the extent necessary, pursuant to _Section 3.07_ ). The
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in respect of Company
Restricted Shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as set forth in
the applicable award agreement governing the applicable Company Restricted
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the
Company Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist
and each former holder of Company Common Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto other than the right to receive the consideration set
forth in this _Section 3.01(a)_.

  



  

(b)  Each Company Preferred Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for the shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_), shall thereupon be canceled and automatically
converted into and deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to
receive a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Closing Per
Share Stock Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares
issuable upon the conversion of such Company Preferred Share, in accordance
with the information set forth in the Spreadsheet (as updated, to the extent
necessary, pursuant to _Section 3.07_ ). As of the Effective Time, the
Company Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist and each former holder of the Company Preferred Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive
the consideration set forth in this _Section 3.01(b)_.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing a fractional share of Acquiror
Common Stock will be issued to any of the Company Stockholders in connection
with payment of the Merger Consideration, and to the extent a fractional
share of Acquiror Common Stock would have been issuable to a Company
Stockholder as part of the Merger Consideration after aggregating all
fractional shares due to such Company Stockholder, Acquiror shall pay to each
such Company Stockholder an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the Reference Price by (ii) the fraction of a
share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Acquiror Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive, but for this _Section 3.01(c)_.

  



  

(d)  Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall thereupon be converted into and
become one validly issued fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and such share
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Company as of immediately following the Effective Time;

  



  

(e)  Each share of treasury stock of the Company shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

3.02   _Withholding_. Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and anyone acting on their behalf shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the payment of any Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to and the making of any such payment
under any applicable tax Law, through the withholding of a number of
shares or cash, if applicable. Any sum which is withheld as permitted by this
_Section _ _3.02_ shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the proper
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable tax Law, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

3.03   _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, pursuant to the terms of the Company
Option Plan and as set forth on the Spreadsheet (as updated, to the extent
necessary, pursuant to _Section 3.07_ ), each Company Option, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and
automatically converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed Option_ ") equal to the product of
(1) the number of Company Common Shares that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2)
the Closing Per Share Stock Consideration (rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any
fractional share eliminated by such rounding), at an exercise price per share
of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the
exercise price per Company Common Share under such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Closing Per Share Exchange Amount (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent), with respect to the number of Company Common
Shares and with the exercise price set forth on the Spreadsheet (as
updated, to the extent necessary, pursuant to _Section 3.07_ ) and otherwise
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(b)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any need of any further corporate action, Acquiror shall assume the Company
Option Plan, with the result that Acquiror may issue the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock after the Effective Time pursuant to the exercise of the Assumed
Options under the Company Option Plan or any other plan of Acquiror or any its
affiliates.

  



  

3.04   _Surrender and Payment_.

  



  

(a)  Following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall, at the Company's sole cost and expense, appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act
as the exchange agent in the Merger; _provided_ , however, that Acquiror
shall (i) afford the Company the opportunity to review any proposed Contract
with the Exchange Agent prior to execution, and shall accept the Company's
reasonable comments thereto; and (ii) not appoint an Exchange Agent prior to
the Effective Time in such a manner that will result in costs or expenses to
the Company to be paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time or in the
event that the Merger Agreement is terminated, in each case in  _clause (ii)_
, absent the written consent of the Company. Promptly after the appointment of
the Exchange Agent, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of Company Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.01_ (other than the Assumed Options), at the
Company's sole cost and expense, a letter of transmittal in a customary form
to be agreed to, reasonably and in good faith, by Acquiror and the Company (a
" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the certificates evidencing such Company Stock, in physical or
electronic form, as the case may be (the " _Certificates_ "), to the extent
such Company Stock is represented by the Certificates, in exchange for the
applicable portion of Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 3.01(c))_ payable to such holder. The Exchange
Agent shall (A) at or promptly following the Effective Time, issue to each
holder of record of Company Stock entitled to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_ (and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 3.01(c))_ that has delivered a Certificate (only
to the extent such Company Stock is represented by a Certificate) (together
with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and customary tax forms that the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith) at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the portion of the Merger
Consideration with respect to such Certificate (or any Company Stock not
represented by a Certificate) so surrendered and the Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled; and (B) following the Effective Time, with respect to
any holder of record of Company Stock entitled to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_ that did not receive such
portion of the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to _Section 3.01(c))_ pursuant to the preceding _clause (A)_ ,
no later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of a Certificate (only to
the extent such Company Stock is represented by a Certificate) (together with
a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and any customary tax forms that the Exchange Agent
may reasonably require in connection therewith), issue to the holder of such
Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) the
Merger Consideration (and pay any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section 3.01(c))_ with respect to such Certificate (or any Company Stock
not represented by a Certificate) so surrendered and the Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration into which such Company Common Shares and Company Preferred
Shares, as applicable, have been converted pursuant to _Section
3.01(a)_ (after giving effect to _Section 3.01(e)_) and _Section 3.01(b)_,
respectively, as reflected in the Stockholder Ownership Allocation,
electronically through book entry-delivery or, upon the written request of any
Company Stockholder, in the form of an original stock certificate (which
stock certificate for shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in respect of
Company Restricted Shares shall reflect the applicable restrictions) to the
address set forth in such Company Stockholder's Letter of Transmittal. Unless
otherwise provided herein, no interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 3.01(c))_ payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or any
Company Stock not represented by a Certificate). Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by a
Certificate) that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company
Stock (other than for the shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.01(e)_) shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes,
to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration
(and any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.01(c))_. If
after the Effective Time, any Certificate (or any Company Stock not
represented by a Certificate) is presented to the Exchange Agent, it shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section 3.04(a)_.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(b)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate (or
any Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the
Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate (or any Company Stock not represented by
a Certificate) or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(c)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to the Acquiror Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) with respect
to the Acquiror Common Stock issuable to such holder hereunder in
consideration for the surrender of such Certificate (or Company Stock not
represented by a Certificate) until the holder of such Certificate
(or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate) shall surrender such
Certificate (or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate). Subject to
the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate (or Company Stock not represented by a Certificate),
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,
payable with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(d)  Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by Company
Stockholders three (3) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Acquiror free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e)  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of loss and indemnity by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Company may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate in accordance
with this Agreement.

  



  

3.05   _Equitable Adjustments_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Acquiror shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be issued as the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such change.

  



  

3.06   _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time
after the Effective Time any further action is reasonably necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company or Merger
Sub, the officers and board of directors of the Surviving Company will be
fully authorized in the name of the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, to take and shall take any and all such lawful and necessary action.

  



  

3.07   _Update to the Spreadsheet_. Subject to compliance by the
Company with _Section_ _6.02_ , no later than close of business on the fifth
(5th) Business Day preceding the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall
have the right to prepare and deliver to Acquiror an updated
Spreadsheet containing changes to the Ownership Allocation, the Stockholder
Ownership Allocation, the allocation of the Merger Consideration Amount and
Assumed Options to be received by each holder of Company Stock or Company
Options pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case, as of the
Closing Date and by applying the same methodology, assumptions, formulas and
techniques used in the preparation of the original Spreadsheet and by using
the Closing Per Share Exchange Amount as of the Closing; _provided_ , that no
changes shall be made to the aggregate Merger Consideration Amount. The
Parties shall meet and confer regarding the updated Spreadsheet no later than
the third (3rd) Business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, and shall
make such changes thereto as the Parties may mutually and in good faith agree
so that the updated Spreadsheet reflects any such changes. Such updated
Spreadsheet shall be the "Spreadsheet" for all purposes of this Agreement.

Article IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in the Schedules to this Agreement (each of which
qualifies (a) the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or
covenant if specified therein and (b) such other representations, warranties
or covenants where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure for
purposes of) such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company represents and warrants
to Acquiror and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

4.01   _Organization and Qualifications; Subsidiaries_. The Company
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it
and to carry on its business as currently conducted. Each other Company
Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
limited liability company, as applicable, power and authority to own, operate
or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to
carry on its business as currently conducted. _Schedule _ _4.01_ sets forth
a true and complete list of each Company Entity, its jurisdiction of
organization, its directors and officers, and each jurisdiction in which such
Company Entity is licensed or qualified to do business. Each Company Entity
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the operation
of its business as currently conducted makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except such licenses or qualifications the absence
of which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.01_, the Company owns all of the
outstanding equity interests of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
Liens, and there are no derivative securities or commitments to issue
derivative securities in respect of such Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.01(b)_ (any entity required to be set forth on _Schedule
4.01(b)_, a " _Minority Interest Entity_ "), no Company Entity owns or has
any ownership interest in any other Person other than the Company's ownership
of such Subsidiaries. True and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company
agreement and any other similar governing documents, each as amended to date
(together,  " _Organizational Documents_ "), of each Company Entity have been
made available to Acquiror. No Company Entity holds any economic, voting or
other interest in the Foundation.

  



  

4.02   _Due Authorization_.

  



  

(a)  The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and, subject to adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholder Approval, to
consummate to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(b)  The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the
part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, subject only in the case of consummation of the Merger, to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholder
Approval is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class or series of
the Company's capital stock required to approve and adopt this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and approve the Merger and consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party hereto,
constitutes, or will constitute, a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the
enforceability hereof may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and as limited by
the availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies or
applicable equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at Law or
in equity). When each Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is or will be a
party has been duly executed and delivered by the Company (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such
Ancillary Agreement will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
the enforceability thereof may be limited by any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and as
limited by the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies or applicable equitable principles (regardless of whether considered
in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

  



  

(c)  The Company Board, by written resolutions adopted by
unanimous vote and not subsequently rescinded or modified, has, as of the
date hereof (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including
the Merger, are in the best interests of, the Company Stockholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable the "agreement of merger" (as such term is
used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, the
Company's Organizational Documents and the Company Stockholders Agreements,
(iii) directed that the "agreement of merger" contained in this Agreement be
submitted to the Company Stockholders for adoption and the Transactions,
including the Merger, be submitted to the Company Stockholders for approval
(in each case, including by the Company Stockholder Approval), and (iv)
resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders (including by the Company
Preferred Stockholders) adopt the "agreement of merger" set forth in this
Agreement and approve the Transactions, including the Merger (collectively,
the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

4.03   _No Conflict; Consents_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger, do not and will not, with or without
the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or both: (i) subject to, in the
case of the Merger, obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval conflict with
or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the same may be
amended from time to time; (ii) subject to, in the case of the Merger,
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the consents referenced in
_Section 4.04_ , conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any

conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any

termination or acceleration of, or a right of termination, cancellation,
modification, acceleration or amendment under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the acceleration or trigger of any payment, posting
of collateral (or right to require the posting of collateral), time of
payment, vesting or increase in the amount of any compensation or benefit
payable pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract of the type described in _Section _ _4.12(a)_ , whether or not set

consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Whenever any event occurs which would reasonably be
expected to result in the Registration Statement, the Consent Solicitation
Statement or the Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Acquiror or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other party hereto of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with
the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to
Acquiror Stockholders, an amendment or supplement to the Registration

distributed to the holders of Acquiror Common Stock, and as of the date of the
Acquiror Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material

present, Acquiror may make one or more successive postponements or

6.10 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving
Company agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of Acquiror, Merger Sub and each Company Entity

(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages and liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any Company Entity, as the
case may be, would have been permitted under applicable Law and their
respective Organizational Documents to indemnify such Indemnified Person
(including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing,
Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) maintain for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in
its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other Organizational Documents
concerning the indemnification and exoneration (including provisions relating
to expense advancement) of officers and directors that are no less favorable
to those Indemnified Persons than the provisions in the Company's or the
Acquiror's Organizational Documents, as applicable, and (ii) not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely
affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as
required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable for, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to honor, each of the covenants in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

(b) Acquiror shall obtain a six (6)-year "tail" policy covering
those Persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies (each, a " _Company Insured Person_ ")
with aggregate coverage of no less than $15 million and containing such other
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to claims alleging wrongful acts occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (except that in no case shall Acquiror be required to pay a
premium for such "tail" policy in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual
premium payable by the Company for the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies); provided, further, that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Acquiror shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(c) Acquiror shall obtain a six (6) year "tail" policy covering
those Persons who are currently covered by the Acquiror's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies (each, an " _Acquiror Insured Person_
") containing terms not less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage with respect to claims alleging wrongful acts occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (except that in no case shall Acquiror be
required to pay a premium for such "tail" policy in excess of 300% of the
aggregate two-year premium payable by the Acquiror for the Acquiror's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies); provided, further,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Acquiror shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the Acquiror shall, with effectiveness as of
the Effective Time, obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering the Persons who will be directors and officers of the Acquiror and
its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and thereafter on terms that are
consistent with market standards.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on Acquiror and the
Surviving Company and all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the
Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving
Company under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any present and former
director and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to whom this
_Section 6.10_ applies without the consent of the affected Person.

accept reasonable comments of the Company to such Form 8-K prior to filing.

preparation of, and prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall prepare and use
reasonable best efforts to provide to the Company for review at least five (5)

required to be disclosed with respect to the Transactions pursuant to Form
8-K (" _Transaction Form 8-K_ "). Prior to Closing, Acquiror and the Company
shall jointly prepare the press release announcing the consummation of the
Transactions (" _Press Release_ "). Promptly following the Closing, Acquiror
shall file the Transaction Form 8-K with the SEC and distribute the Press
Release; _provided _ that Acquiror shall accept reasonable comments of the
Company to the Transaction Form 8-K prior to filing.

  



  

6.12 _Trust Account; No Claims Against the Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Acquiror shall take all actions necessary, and
shall cause the documents, opinions and notices required to be delivered to
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, a New York limited liability
trust company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to that certain Investment
Management Trust Agreement dated as of September 12, 2019, by and between
Acquiror and Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") to be so delivered and to
cause the funds in the account established by Acquiror for the benefit of
certain stockholders of Acquiror and the underwriter of Acquiror's initial
public offering (the " _Trust Account_ ") to be disbursed in accordance with
the Trust Agreement for the following: (i) the redemption of any shares of

73

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Company
acknowledges that it has received a copy of Acquiror's final prospectus
dated September 13, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ ") and understands that Acquiror
has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial
public offering and the overallotment shares acquired by its underwriters and
from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the initial
public offering (including interest accrued from time to time thereon)
for the benefit of Acquiror's public stockholders (including overallotment
shares acquired by Acquiror's underwriters, the " _Public Stockholders_ "),
and that, except as otherwise described in the Prospectus, Acquiror may
disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (i) to the Public Stockholders
in the event they elect to redeem their Acquiror shares in connection with
the consummation of Acquiror's business combination (as defined in the
Prospectus, the " _Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an
extension of its deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (ii) to the
Public Stockholders if Acquiror fails to consummate such a Business
Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing date of
Acquiror's initial public offering, (iii) with respect to any interest earned
on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any franchise
or income taxes, or (iv) to Acquiror after or concurrently with the
consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of Acquiror
entering into this Agreement, and for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby
agrees, on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members, partners, Affiliates,
agents and other representatives (collectively,  " _Representatives_ "), that
the Company and its Representatives do not have (other than their rights upon
Closing) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to
hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of itself and
its affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company
or any of its affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including
distributions therefrom) prior to Closing or in the future as a result of, or
arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Acquiror and
will not prior to Closing seek recourse against the Trust Account for any
reason whatsoever; _provided_ that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit the Company's and its Representatives' right to pursue a claim
against Acquiror for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside
the Trust Account or for specific performance or other equitable relief
(including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its obligations under
this Agreement and a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform
its obligations under the Trust Agreement, including distribution of funds
from the Trust Account upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims
that the Company or its Representatives may have in the future against
Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account, other than to
Public Stockholders, and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with
any such funds) or for specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The Company agrees and
acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and
specifically relied upon by Acquiror and its affiliates to induce Acquiror to
enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends and understands
such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company and each
of its affiliates under applicable law. This _Section 6.12(b) _shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and will not expire and may not be altered
in any way prior to the Closing without the express written consent of
Acquiror.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(c) At the Closing, Acquiror shall make appropriate arrangements to
cause the funds in the Trust Account to be disbursed in accordance with the
Trust Agreement for the following: (i) the redemption of any shares of
Acquiror Common Stock required to be redeemed in connection with the
Transactions and elections of holders of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance
with the terms set forth in the Prospectus and the Proxy Statement and (ii)
the balance of the assets in the Trust Account, after payment of the amounts
required under subsection (i), to be disbursed at the direction of Acquiror
and to effect the Transactions in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

6.13 _Subscription Agreements_. Acquiror shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or any replacements or terminations of, the Subscription
Agreements in any manner other than (i) as expressly provided for by the terms
of the Subscription Agreements or (ii) to reflect any permitted assignments
or transfers of the Subscription Agreements by the applicable PIPE
Investors pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that the parties acknowledge that any
proposed amendment, modification or waiver of the Subscription Agreements
that affects the offering price of the Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements, that reduces the aggregate amount of proceeds to be
received by Acquiror under the Subscription Agreements or that adds
additional conditions to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreements may be rejected
by the Company in its sole discretion). Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Subscription Agreements on the terms and conditions
described therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror
shall give the Company prompt (and, in any event within three (3) Business
Days) written notice: (A) of any proposed amendment to any Subscription
Agreement; (B) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could give rise to any breach
or default) by any party to any Subscription Agreement known to Acquiror; and
(C) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any party to any Subscription Agreement with respect to any actual, potential
or claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of
any Subscription Agreement. If any Subscription Agreement expires or is
terminated, withdrawn or repudiated by any party thereto prior to the
Closing, such that the aggregate amount of PIPE Investment as of the Closing
is expected to be below $125,000,000 (a " _PIPE Financing Shortfall_ "),

respect to the Company would reasonably be expected to be a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the

expected to receive, have received, or have the right or entitlement to
receive any payments and/or other benefits (including, without limitation,
acceleration of vesting) that would otherwise constitute "parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code, of such Person's right or entitlement to

consider in good faith. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver
to Acquiror evidence that a vote of the Company Stockholders was solicited in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.21(a)_ and that
either (i) 280G Approval was obtained, or (ii) 280G Approval was not obtained,

Parachute Payment Waivers.

9.03 _Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules_. All annexes, exhibits
and schedules attached hereto, including the Schedules, are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. The Schedules shall be arranged in separate parts corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement,
and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed
to relate to and to qualify the representation or warranty set forth in the
corresponding numbered or lettered Section or subsection of this
Agreement, as well as (a) any other representation or warranty where such
information is cross-referenced in the applicable part of the Schedules; or
(b) any other representation or warranty where it is reasonably apparent on
the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document referred to
therein) that such information qualifies such other representation and
warranty of the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, in this Agreement.
Certain information set forth in the Schedules is or may be included solely
for informational purposes, is not material or an admission of liability with
respect to the matters covered by the information, and may not be required to
be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules does not imply that such
amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or are not material, and no party
hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the parties hereto as to whether any obligation, item, or matter not
described herein or included in the Schedules is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure in the Schedules relating to any
possible breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any agreement, law or
regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach, violation or non-compliance exists or
has actually occurred, and nothing in Schedules shall constitute an admission
of any liability or obligation of any Person to any other Person or shall
confer or give any third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement,
cause of action or any other right whatsoever.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

9.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party
hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ that if the Merger and the
Closing occurs, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall be responsible for
and shall pay at or after the Closing all Transaction Expenses in accordance
with their terms and the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

9.05 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives, and nothing herein, express or
implied, it intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement; provided, that the Indemnified Persons, the Company
Insured Persons and the Acquiror Insured Persons who are not otherwise party
to this Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror and/or Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement without the consent of any Person to any lender (or agent therefor)
to Acquiror or Merger Sub or their subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof as
security for obligations to such lender (or lenders) in respect of any
financing agreements or arrangements entered into by Acquiror, Merger Sub or
its subsidiaries and Affiliates with such lenders or to an acquirer of all or
substantially all of the assets or business of Acquiror or Merger Sub in any
form of transaction, which assignment shall not relieve Acquiror or
Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

9.06   _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement, the rights and
duties of the parties hereto, and any disputes (whether in contract, tort or
statute) arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement will be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to any principles or rules of
conflict of Laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits, for itself
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York located in New York, New York or, if such
court declines to accept jurisdiction, then any court of the State of New
York sitting in the borough of Manhattan), and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any Action
based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement), or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Actions shall
be heard and determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York located in New York, New York or, if such court declines to accept
jurisdiction, then any court of the State of New York sitting in the borough
of Manhattan), (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
Action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement) in the Delaware Court
of Chancery, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York located in New York, New York or any court of the State of New York
sitting in the borough of Manhattan, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Action in any such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at the applicable address in Section
9.02 shall be effective service of process for any Action brought in any such
court or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, will be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

  



  

   

88

 



    



  

9.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law that cannot be waived, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation
based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement,
including but not limited to any course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal
or written statement or action of any party hereto.

  



  

9.08   _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of
contents in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in
any way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or
otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

9.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page, including
any electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000
(e.g. www.docusign.com), to this Agreement by facsimile or by e-mail in
"portable document format" shall be effective as delivery of a mutually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

9.10 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise contemplated
herein, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire
agreement with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the
Ancillary Agreements, the Exhibits and the Schedules (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Schedules), the statements in the body of
this Agreement shall control.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

9.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held
invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The
parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any
extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing
this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that
is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision
giving effect to the intent of the parties.

  



  

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and it is accordingly agreed
that the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court specified in _Section _ _9.06_ , in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) any party hereto has an adequate remedy at Law or (y)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at Law or equity. Each party hereto further agrees that no party hereto shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtain any remedy referred to in this
_Section 9.12_, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

  



  

9.13 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after
the Acquiror Stockholder Approval is obtained, there shall be no amendment or
waiver that, pursuant to applicable Law, requires further approval of the
Acquiror Stockholders, without the receipt of such further approvals; and
(ii) after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, there shall be no
amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable Law, requires further
approval of the Company Stockholders, without receipt of such
further approvals.

  



  

9.14 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the parties
hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements, terms or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

  



  

   

90

 



    



  

9.15 _Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a) Acquiror hereby agrees on behalf of its directors, members,

(a)   _General_. The Committee shall administer the Plan. To the
extent required to comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under

Plan), it is intended that each member of the Committee shall, at the time
such member takes any action with respect to an Award under the Plan that is
intended to qualify for the exemptions provided by Rule 16b-3 promulgated

Applicable Law, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its
responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate
all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any Person or Persons

Committee at any time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Committee may delegate to one or more officers of any member of the Company
Group the authority to act on behalf of the Committee with respect to any
matter, right, obligation, or election which is the responsibility of, or
which is allocated to, the Committee herein, and which may be so delegated in
accordance with Applicable Law, except for grants of Awards to Non-Employee
Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 4(c), it is intended
that any action under the Plan intended to qualify for an exemption provided
by Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act related to Persons who are
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act will be taken only by the Board or
by a committee or subcommittee of two or more Qualifying Directors. However,
the fact that any member of such committee or subcommittee shall fail to
qualify as a Qualifying Director shall not invalidate any action that is
otherwise valid under the Plan.

  



  

(d)   _Finality of Decisions_. Unless otherwise expressly
provided in the Plan, all designations, determinations, interpretations, and
other decisions under or with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award
Agreement shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made
at any time, and shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all Persons,
including, without limitation, any member of the Company Group, any
Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award, and any stockholder of
the Company.

  



  

(e) _Indemnification_. No member of the Board, the Committee,
or any employee or agent of any member of the Company Group (each such Person,
an  " _Indemnifiable Person_ ") shall be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken or any determination made with respect to the Plan or any
Award hereunder (unless constituting fraud, dishonesty, or a willful criminal
act or omission). Each Indemnifiable Person shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law
against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense (including attorneys'
fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnifiable Person in
connection with or resulting from any action, suit, or proceeding to which
such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in which such Indemnifiable Person
may be involved by reason of any action taken or omitted to be taken or
determination made with respect to the Plan or any Award hereunder and
against and from any and all amounts paid by such Indemnifiable Person with
the Company's approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such Indemnifiable
Person in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding
against such Indemnifiable Person, and the Company shall advance to such
Indemnifiable Person any such expenses promptly upon written request (which
request shall include an undertaking by the Indemnifiable Person to repay the
amount of such advance if it shall ultimately be determined, as provided
below, that the Indemnifiable Person is not entitled to be indemnified);
_provided_ , that the Company shall have the right, at its own expense, to
assume and defend any such action, suit, or proceeding and once the Company
gives notice of its intent to assume the defense, the Company shall have sole
control over such defense with counsel of the Company's choice. The foregoing
right of indemnification shall not be available to an Indemnifiable Person to
the extent that a final judgment or other final adjudication (in either case
not subject to further appeal) binding upon such Indemnifiable Person
determines that the acts, omissions, or determinations of such Indemnifiable
Person giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted from such
Indemnifiable Person's fraud, dishonesty, or willful criminal act or omission
or that such right of indemnification is otherwise prohibited by Applicable
Law or by the organizational documents of any member of the Company Group.
The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of or
otherwise supersede any other rights of indemnification to which such
Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under (i) the organizational documents
of any member of the Company Group, (ii) pursuant to Applicable Law, (iii) an
individual indemnification agreement or contract, or otherwise, or (iv) any
other power that the Company may have to indemnify such Indemnifiable Persons
or hold such Indemnifiable Persons harmless.

granted to the Committee under the Plan.

(b) _Share Reserve and Limits_. Awards granted under the Plan
shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) subject to Section 10 of
the Plan, no more than [insert the number of shares of Common Stock equal to
[__]% of the fully diluted shares of Common Stock as of the Effective Time
(as defined in the Merger Agreement)] shares of Common Stock (the " _Absolute
Share Limit_ ") shall be available for Awards under the Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Absolute Share Limit shall be automatically increased
(A) on the first day of each fiscal year following the fiscal year in which
the Effective Date falls in an amount equal to the least of (x) [insert the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to [__]% of the fully diluted shares
of Common Stock as of the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement)] shares of Common Stock, (y) [__]% of the total number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding
fiscal year, and (z) a lower number of shares of Common Stock as determined by
the Board; and (B) for any shares of Common Stock underlying awards
outstanding under the Prior Plan that, on or after the Effective Date, expire
or are canceled, forfeited, terminated, settled in cash or otherwise settled

Stock to which the award related and thereupon become available for grant
under the Plan pursuant to Section 5(c) of the Plan; (ii) subject to Section
10 of the Plan, no more than the number of shares of Common Stock equal to
the Absolute Share Limit may be issued in the aggregate pursuant to the
exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan; and (iii) during
a single fiscal year, each Non-Employee Director, shall be granted a number of
shares Common Stock subject to Awards, taken together with any cash fees paid
to such Non-Employee Director during such fiscal year, equal to (A) a total
value of $[_____] (calculating the value of any such Awards based on the grant
date fair value of such Awards for financial reporting purposes) or (B) such
lower amount as determined by the Board prior to the Date of Grant, either
as part of the Company's non-employee director compensation program or as
otherwise determined by the Board in the event of any change to such non-
employee director's compensation program or for any particular period of
service. To the extent the Board makes a determination pursuant to clause
(iii)(B) above with respect to any year of service, such determination shall
in no event be applicable to any subsequent year of service without a further
determination by the Board in respect of any subsequent year of service.

  



  

   



 

11

    



  

(c)   _Share Counting_. Other than with respect to Substitute
Awards, to the extent that an Award (or, if granted under the Prior Plan,
award) expires or is canceled, forfeited, terminated, settled in cash, or
otherwise is settled without issuance to the Participant of the full number
of shares of Common Stock to which the Award (or, if granted under the Prior
Plan, award) related, the unissued shares of Common Stock will again be
available for grant under the Plan. Shares of Common Stock withheld in
payment of the Exercise Price, or taxes relating to an Award (or, if granted
under the Prior Plan, award), and shares equal to the number of shares
surrendered in payment of any Exercise Price, or taxes relating to an Award,
shall be deemed to constitute shares not issued to the Participant and shall
be deemed to again be available for Awards under the Plan;  _provided,
however_ , that such shares shall not become available for issuance hereunder
if either: (i) the applicable shares are withheld or surrendered following
the termination of the Plan; or (ii) at the time the applicable shares are
withheld or surrendered, it would constitute a material revision of the Plan
subject to stockholder approval under any then-applicable rules of the
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed.

  



  

(d)   _Source of Shares_. Shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company in settlement of Awards may be authorized and unissued shares, shares
of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, shares of Common
Stock purchased on the open market or by private purchase, or a combination
of the foregoing.

  



  

(e) _Substitute Awards_. Awards may, in the sole discretion of
the Committee, be granted under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution
for, outstanding Awards previously granted by an entity directly or indirectly
acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines (" _Substitute
Awards_ "). Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the Absolute Share
Limit; _provided_ , that Substitute Awards issued in connection with the
assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding Options intended to
qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code shall be counted against the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
available for Awards of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. Subject to
applicable stock exchange requirements, available shares under a stockholder-
approved plan of an entity directly or indirectly acquired by the Company or
with which the Company combines (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the
acquisition or combination transaction) may be used for Awards under the Plan
and shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for
issuance under the Plan.

  



  

   



 

12

    



  

6.  Options.

  



  

(a)   _General_. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be
evidenced by an Award Agreement, which agreement need not be the same for
each Participant. Each Option so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 6, and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement. All Options granted under the Plan shall be Nonqualified Stock
Options unless the applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the
Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option. Incentive Stock Options
shall be granted only to Eligible Persons who are employees of a member of
the Company Group, and no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any
Eligible Person who is ineligible to receive an Incentive Stock Option under
the Code. No Option shall be treated as an Incentive Stock Option unless the
Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company in a manner intended
to comply with the stockholder approval requirements of Section 422(b)(1) of
the Code; _provided_ , that any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock
Option shall not fail to be effective solely on account of a failure to
obtain such approval, but rather such Option shall be treated as a
Nonqualified Stock Option unless and until such approval is obtained. In the
case of an Incentive Stock Option, the terms and conditions of such
grant shall be subject to, and comply with, such rules as may be prescribed
by Section 422 of the Code. If for any reason an Option intended to be an
Incentive Stock Option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an
Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such
Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as a Nonqualified Stock Option
appropriately granted under the Plan.

  



  

(b)   _Exercise Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the
Committee in the case of Substitute Awards, the exercise price (" _Exercise
Price_ ") per share of Common Stock for each Option shall not be less than
100% of the Fair Market Value of such share (determined as of the Date of
Grant); _provided, however_ , that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option
granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Option, owns
stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock
of any member of the Company Group, the Exercise Price per share shall be no
less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per share on the Date of Grant.

  



  

(c)   _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

  



  

(i) Options shall vest and become exercisable in such manner
and on such date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by
the Committee including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a)
of the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such vesting
dates or events, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate the
vesting of any Options at any time and for any reason. Options shall expire
upon a date determined by the Committee, not to exceed ten years from the
Date of Grant (the " _Option Period_ "); _provided_ , that if the Option
Period (other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) would expire at
a time when trading in the Common Stock is prohibited by the Company's
insider trading policy (or Company-imposed "blackout period"), then the Option
Period shall be automatically extended until the 30th day following the
expiration of such prohibition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Option Period exceed five years from the Date of Grant in the case
of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who on the Date of
Grant owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of
all classes of stock of any member of the Company Group.

  



  

   



 

13

    



  

(ii)  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a Participant's
Termination by the Service Recipient for Cause, all outstanding Options
granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire; (B) a
Participant's Termination due to death or Disability, each
outstanding unvested Option granted to such Participant shall immediately
terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested Option shall
remain exercisable for one year thereafter (but in no event beyond the
expiration of the Option Period); and (C) a Participant's Termination for any
other reason, each outstanding unvested Option granted to such Participant
shall immediately terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested Option
shall remain exercisable for 90 days thereafter (but in no event beyond the
expiration of the Option Period).

  



  

(d) _Method of Exercise and Form of Payment_. No shares of
Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to any exercise of an Option
until payment in full of the Exercise Price therefor is received by the
Company and the Participant has paid to the Company an amount equal to any
federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income, employment, and any other
applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 12(d) of the Plan. Options that have become exercisable may
be exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company (or telephonic instructions to the extent provided by the Committee)
in accordance with the terms of the Option accompanied by payment of the
Exercise Price. The Exercise Price shall be payable: (i) in cash, check, cash
equivalent, and/or shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value at
the time the Option is exercised (including, pursuant to procedures approved
by the Committee, by means of attestation of ownership of a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock in lieu of actual issuance of such shares to
the Company); _provided_ , that such shares of Common Stock are not subject
to any pledge or other security interest and have been held by the
Participant for at least six months (or such other period as established from
time to time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment
applying GAAP); or (ii) by such other method as the Committee may permit
in its sole discretion, including, without limitation (A) in other property
having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the Exercise
Price; (B) if there is a public market for the Common Stock at such time, by
means of a broker-assisted  "cashless exercise" pursuant to which the Company
is delivered (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the
Committee) a copy of irrevocable instructions to a stockbroker to sell the
shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of the Option and
to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price; or
(C) a  "net exercise" procedure effected by withholding the minimum number of
shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of an Option that are
needed to pay the Exercise Price and any federal, state, local, and non-U.S.
income, employment, and any other applicable taxes that are statutorily
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 12(d) of the Plan. Any
fractional share of Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

  



  

   



 

14

    



  

(e)   _Notification upon Disqualifying Disposition of an
Incentive Stock Option_. Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option
under the Plan shall notify the Company in writing immediately after the
date the Participant makes a disqualifying disposition of any shares of
Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Incentive Stock
Option. A disqualifying disposition is any disposition (including, without
limitation, any sale) of such share of Common Stock before the later of (i)
the date that is two years after the Date of Grant of the Incentive Stock
Option, or (ii) the date that is one year after the date of exercise of the
Incentive Stock Option. The Company may, if determined by the Committee
and in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, retain
possession, as agent for the applicable Participant, of any share of Common
Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option until the
end of the period described in the preceding sentence, subject to complying
with any instructions from such Participant as to the sale of such share of
Common Stock.

  



  

(f)   _Compliance With Applicable Laws, etc_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall a Participant be permitted to exercise an
Option in a manner which the Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, as it may be amended from time to time, or any other
Applicable Law.

  



  

7.  Stock Appreciation Rights.

  



  

(a)   _General_. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be
evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each SAR so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 7, and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement. Any Option granted under the Plan may include tandem SARs. The
Committee also may award SARs to Eligible Persons independent of any Option.

  



  

(b)   _Strike Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the
Committee in the case of Substitute Awards, the strike price (" _Strike
Price_ ") per share of Common Stock for each SAR shall not be less than 100%
of the Fair Market Value of such share (determined as of the Date of Grant).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a SAR granted in tandem with (or in
substitution for) an Option previously granted shall have a Strike Price equal
to the Exercise Price of the corresponding Option.

  



  

(c)   _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

  



  

(i) A SAR granted in connection with an Option shall become
exercisable and shall expire according to the same vesting schedule
and expiration provisions as the corresponding Option. A SAR granted
independent of an Option shall vest and become exercisable in such manner and
on such date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the
Committee including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of
the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such vesting
dates or events, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the
vesting of any SAR at any time and for any reason. SARs shall expire upon a
date determined by the Committee, not to exceed ten years from the Date of
Grant (the  " _SAR Period_ "); _provided_ , that if the SAR Period would
expire at a time when trading in the Common Stock is prohibited by the
Company's insider trading policy (or Company-imposed "blackout period"), then
the SAR Period shall be automatically extended until the 30th day following
the expiration of such prohibition.

  



  

   



 

15

    



  

(ii)  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a Participant's
Termination by the Service Recipient for Cause, all outstanding SARs granted
to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire; (B) a
Participant's Termination due to death or Disability, each
outstanding unvested SAR granted to such Participant shall immediately
terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested SAR shall remain
exercisable for one year thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of
the SAR Period); and (C) a Participant's Termination for any other reason,
each outstanding unvested SAR granted to such Participant shall immediately
terminate and expire, and each outstanding vested SAR shall remain
exercisable for 90 days thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of
the SAR Period).

  



  

(d)   _Method of Exercise_. SARs that have become exercisable
may be exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to
the Company in accordance with the terms of the Award, specifying the
number of SARs to be exercised and the date on which such SARs were awarded.

  



  

(e)   _Payment_. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall
pay to the Participant an amount equal to the number of shares subject to the
SAR that is being exercised multiplied by the excess of the Fair Market Value
of one share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the Strike Price, less
an amount equal to any federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income,
employment, and any other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be
withheld in accordance with Section 12(d) of the Plan. The Company shall pay
such amount in cash, in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value,
or any combination thereof, as determined by the Committee. Any fractional
share of Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

  



  

8.  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

(a)   _General_. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Restricted Stock
and Restricted Stock Unit so granted shall be subject to the conditions set
forth in this Section 8, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with
the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Notation; Escrow or
Similar Arrangement_. Upon the grant of Restricted Stock, the
Committee shall, at its discretion, cause a stock certificate registered in
the name of the Participant to be issued or shall cause share(s) of Common
Stock to be registered in the name of the Participant and held in book-entry
form subject to the Company's directions and, if the Committee determines
that the Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company or in escrow rather
than issued to the Participant pending the release of the applicable
restrictions, the Committee may require the Participant to additionally
execute and deliver to the Company (i) an escrow agreement satisfactory to
the Committee, if applicable, and (ii) the appropriate stock power (endorsed
in blank) with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by such agreement. If
a Participant shall fail to execute and deliver (in a manner permitted under
Section 12(a) of the Plan or as otherwise determined by the Committee) an
agreement evidencing an Award of Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an
escrow agreement and blank stock power within the amount of time specified by
the Committee, the Award shall be null and void. Subject to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 8, Section 12(b) of the Plan, and the
applicable Award Agreement, a Participant generally shall have the rights and
privileges of a stockholder as to shares of Restricted Stock, including,
without limitation, the right to vote such Restricted Stock. To the extent
shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited, any stock certificates issued to
the Participant evidencing such shares shall be returned to the Company
without undue delay, and all rights of the Participant to such shares and as
a stockholder with respect thereto shall terminate automatically without
further obligation on the part of the Company. A Participant shall have no
rights or privileges as a stockholder as to Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

   



 

16

    



  

(c)   _Vesting; Termination_.

  



  

(i)  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall vest, and
any applicable Restricted Period shall lapse, in such manner and on such date
or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the Committee
including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such dates or events, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit or the lapsing of any applicable
Restricted Period at any time and for any reason.

  



  

(ii)  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of a Participant's Termination for
any reason prior to the time that such Participant's Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, have vested, (A) all vesting with
respect to such Participant's Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as
applicable, shall cease and (B) unvested shares of Restricted Stock and
unvested Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, shall be forfeited to the
Company by the Participant for no consideration as of the date of such
Termination.

  



  

(d)   _Issuance of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted
Stock Units_.

  



  

(i)  Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect
to any shares of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement shall be of no further force or effect with respect
to such shares, except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. If an
escrow arrangement is used, upon such expiration the Company shall issue to
the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, without charge, the stock
certificate (or, if applicable, a notice evidencing a book-entry notation)
evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock that have not then been forfeited
and with respect to which the Restricted Period has expired (rounded down to
the nearest full share).

  



  

(ii) Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in an Award
Agreement or otherwise, upon the expiration of the Restricted Period
with respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall
issue to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, without charge,
one share of Common Stock (or other securities or other property, as
applicable) for each such outstanding Restricted Stock Unit; _provided,
however_ , that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to (A)
pay cash or part cash and part shares of Common Stock in lieu of issuing only
shares of Common Stock in respect of such Restricted Stock Units or (B) defer
the issuance of shares of Common Stock (or cash or part cash and part shares
of Common Stock, as the case may be) beyond the expiration of the Restricted
Period if such extension would not cause adverse tax consequences under
Section 409A of the Code. If a cash payment is made in lieu of issuing shares
of Common Stock in respect of such Restricted Stock Units, the amount of such
payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock as
of the date on which the Restricted Period lapsed with respect to such
Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

   



 

17

    



  

(e)   _Legends on Restricted Stock_. Each certificate, if any,
or book entry representing Restricted Stocks awarded under the Plan, if any,
shall bear a legend or book-entry notation substantially in the form of the
following, in addition to any other information the Company deems
appropriate, until the lapse of all restrictions with respect to such
shares of Common Stock:

  



  

TRANSFER OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS RESTRICTED
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE Experience investment Corp. 2021 Omnibus
INCENTIVE PLAN AND A RESTRICTED Stock AWARD AGREEMENT BETWEEN experience
investment corp. AND THE PARTICIPANT. A COPY OF SUCH PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENT
IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF experience investment corp.

  



  

9.  Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may grant Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards under the Plan to Eligible Persons, alone or in tandem with other Awards, in such amounts and dependent on such conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan. Each Other Equity-Based Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and each Other Cash-Based Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced in such form as the Committee may determine from time to time. Each Other Equity-Based Award or Other Cash-Based Award, as applicable, so granted shall be subject to such conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement or other form evidencing such Award, including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 12(c) of the Plan.

  



  

10.  Changes in Capital Structure and Similar Events. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to all Awards granted hereunder (other than Other Cash-Based Awards):

  



  

(a) _General_. In the event of (i) any dividend (other than
regular cash dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of
cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities, or other property),
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or
exchange of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company,
issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock
or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or
event that affects the shares of Common Stock (including a Change in
Control), or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company,
including changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations, or other
requirements, that the Committee determines, in its sole discretion,
could result in substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights intended to
be granted to, or available for, Participants (any event in (i) or (ii), an "
_Adjustment Event_ "), the Committee shall, in respect of any such Adjustment
Event, make such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any, as it, in
its sole discretion, deems equitable, to any or all of: (A) the Absolute
Share Limit, or any other limit applicable under the Plan with respect to the
number of Awards that may be granted hereunder; (B) the number of shares of
Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other
securities or other property) that may be issued in respect of Awards or with
respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan or any Sub-Plan; and
(C) the terms of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation,
(I) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company
(or number and kind of other securities or other property) subject to
outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards relate; (II) the Exercise
Price or Strike Price with respect to any Award; or (III) any applicable
performance measures; _provided_ , that in the case of any
"equity restructuring" (within the meaning of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor
pronouncement thereto)), the Committee shall make an equitable or
proportionate adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity
restructuring. Any adjustment under this Section 10 shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes.

  



  

   



 

18

    



  

(b)   _Adjustment Events_. Without limiting the foregoing,
except as may otherwise be provided in an Award Agreement, in connection with
any Adjustment Event, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for
any one or more of the following:

  



  

(i)  substitution or assumption of Awards (or awards of an
acquiring company), acceleration of the exercisability of, lapse of
restrictions on, or termination of Awards, or a period of time (which shall
not be required to be more than ten days) for Participants to exercise
outstanding Awards prior to the occurrence of such event (and any such
Award not so exercised shall terminate upon the occurrence of such event);
and

  



  

(ii) subject to any limitations or reductions as may be
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, cancellation of any one or
more outstanding Awards and payment to the holders of such Awards that are
vested as of such cancellation (including, without limitation, any Awards
that would vest as a result of the occurrence of such event but for such
cancellation or for which vesting is accelerated by the Committee in
connection with such event) the value of such Awards, if any, as determined by
the Committee (which value, if applicable, may be based upon the price per
share of Common Stock received or to be received by other stockholders of the
Company in such event), including, without limitation, in the case of an
outstanding Option or SAR, a cash payment in an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of the Fair Market Value (as of a date specified by the Committee) of
the shares of Common Stock subject to such Option or SAR over the aggregate
Exercise Price or Strike Price of such Option or SAR (it being understood
that, in such event, any Option or SAR having a per share Exercise Price or
Strike Price equal to, or in excess of, the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock subject thereto may be canceled and terminated without any
payment or consideration therefor), or, in the case of Restricted Stock,
Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards that are not vested as
of such cancellation, a cash payment or equity subject to deferred vesting
and delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions applicable to such
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards prior
to cancellation, or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

  



  

   



 

19

    



  

Payments to holders pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be made in cash or,
in the sole discretion of the Committee, in the form of such other
consideration necessary for a Participant to receive property, cash, or
securities (or combination thereof) as such Participant would have been
entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the transaction if the Participant
had been, immediately prior to such transaction, the holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by the Award at such time (less any applicable
Exercise Price or Strike Price).

  



  

(c)   _Other Requirements_. Prior to any payment or adjustment
contemplated under this Section 10, the Committee may require a Participant
to (i) represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to the
Participant's Awards; (ii) bear such Participant's pro rata share of any
post-closing indemnity obligations, and be subject to the same post-closing
purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and
similar conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any
limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code; and (iii) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably
determined by the Committee.

  



  

(d)   _Fractional Shares_. Any adjustment provided under this
Section 10 may provide for the elimination of any fractional share that might
otherwise become subject to an Award.

  



  

(e)   _Binding Effect_. Any adjustment, substitution,
determination of value or other action taken by the Committee under this
Section 10 shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

  



  

11.  Amendments and Termination.

  



  

(a)   _Amendment and Termination of the Plan_. The Board may
amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion
thereof at any time; _provided_ , that no such amendment, alteration,
suspension, discontinuance, or termination shall be made without stockholder
approval if: (i) such approval is required under Applicable Law; (ii) it
would materially increase the number of securities which may be issued under
the Plan (except for increases pursuant to Section 5 or 10 of the Plan), or
(iii) it would materially modify the requirements for participation in the
Plan; _provided further_ , that any such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance, or termination that would materially and adversely affect
the rights of any Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Award
theretofore granted shall not to that extent be effective without the consent
of the affected Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment shall be made to the last proviso of Section 11(b) of
the Plan without stockholder approval.

  



  

   



 

20

    



     

(b)   _Amendment of Award Agreements_. The Committee may, to the
extent consistent with the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award
Agreement, in its sole discretion, waive any conditions or rights under,
amend any terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel, or terminate, any
Award theretofore granted or the associated Award Agreement, prospectively or
retroactively (including after a Participant's Termination); _provided_ ,
that, other than pursuant to Section 10, any such waiver, amendment,
alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation, or termination that
would materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant with
respect to any Award theretofore granted shall not to that extent be
effective without the consent of the affected Participant; _provided further_
, that without stockholder approval, except as otherwise permitted under
Section 10 of the Plan, (i) no amendment or modification may reduce the
Exercise Price of any Option or the Strike Price of any SAR; (ii) the
Committee may not cancel any outstanding Option or SAR and replace it with a
new Option or SAR (with a lower Exercise Price or Strike Price, as the case
may be) or other Award or cash payment that is greater than the intrinsic
value (if any) of the canceled Option or SAR; and (iii) the Committee may not
take any other action which is considered a "repricing" for purposes of the
stockholder approval rules of any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the securities of the Company are listed or quoted.

  



  

12.  General. 

  



  

(a)   _Award Agreements_. Each Award (other than an Other Cash-
Based Award) under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which
shall be delivered to the Participant to whom such Award was granted
and shall specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules
applicable thereto, including, without limitation, any
Performance Conditions, the effect on such Award of the death, Disability, or
Termination of a Participant, or of such other events as may be determined by
the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, an Award Agreement may be in any such
form (written or electronic) as determined by the Committee (including,
without limitation, a Board or Committee resolution, an employment agreement,
a notice, a certificate, or a letter) evidencing the Award. The Committee
need not require an Award Agreement to be signed by the Participant or a duly
authorized representative of the Company.

  



  

(b)   _Nontransferability_.

  



  

(i)  Each Award shall be exercisable only by such Participant to
whom such Award was granted during the Participant's lifetime, or, if
permissible under Applicable Law, by the Participant's legal guardian
or representative. No Award may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached,
sold, or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant (unless such
transfer is specifically required pursuant to a domestic relations order or by
Applicable Law) other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution
and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale,
transfer, or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against any member
of the Company Group; _provided_ , that the designation of a beneficiary
shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale,
transfer, or encumbrance.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, permit Awards (other than Incentive Stock Options) to
be transferred by a Participant, without consideration, subject to such rules
as the Committee may adopt consistent with any applicable Award Agreement to
preserve the purposes of the Plan, to: (A) any Person who is a "family member"
of the Participant, as such term is used in the instructions to Form S-8
under the Securities Act or any successor form of registration statement
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, the "
_Immediate Family Members_ "); (B) a trust solely for the benefit of the
Participant and the Participant's Immediate Family Members; (C) a partnership
or limited liability company whose only partners or stockholders are the
Participant and the Participant's Immediate Family Members; or (D) a
beneficiary to whom donations are eligible to be treated as  "charitable
contributions" for federal income tax purposes (each transferee described in
clauses (A), (B), (C), and (D) above is hereinafter referred to as a "
_Permitted Transferee_ "); _provided_ , that the Participant gives the
Committee advance written notice describing the terms and conditions of the
proposed transfer and the Committee notifies the Participant in writing that
such a transfer would comply with the requirements of the Plan.

  



  

   



 

21

    



  

(iii)  The terms of any Award transferred in accordance with clause
(ii) above shall apply to the Permitted Transferee and any reference in the
Plan or in any applicable Award Agreement to a Participant shall be deemed to
refer to the Permitted Transferee, except that: (A) Permitted Transferees
shall not be entitled to transfer any Award, other than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution; (B) Permitted Transferees shall not be entitled
to exercise any transferred Option unless there shall be in effect a
registration statement on an appropriate form covering the shares of Common
Stock to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option if the Committee
determines, consistent with any applicable Award Agreement, that such a
registration statement is necessary or appropriate; (C) neither the Committee
nor the Company shall be required to provide any notice to a Permitted
Transferee, whether or not such notice is or would otherwise have been
required to be given to the Participant under the Plan or otherwise; and (D)
the consequences of a Participant's Termination under the terms of the Plan
and the applicable Award Agreement shall continue to be applied with respect
to the Participant, including, without limitation, that an Option shall be
exercisable by the Permitted Transferee only to the extent, and for the
periods, specified in the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

(c)   _Dividends and Dividend Equivalents_.

  



  

(i)  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a
Participant as part of an Award with dividends, dividend equivalents, or
similar payments in respect of Awards, payable in cash, shares of Common
Stock, other securities, other Awards or other property, on a current or
deferred basis, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, payment
directly to the Participant, withholding of such amounts by the Company
subject to vesting of the Award or reinvestment in additional shares of Common
Stock, Restricted Stock or other Awards.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, unless otherwise provided
in the Award Agreement, any dividend otherwise payable in respect of
any shares of Restricted Stock that remain subject to vesting conditions at
the time of payment of such dividend shall be retained by the Company, remain
subject to the same vesting conditions as the Restricted Stock to which the
dividend relates and shall be delivered (without interest) to the Participant
within 15 days following the date on which such restrictions on such
Restricted Stock lapse (and the right to any such accumulated dividends shall
be forfeited upon the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock to which such
dividends relate).

  



  

   



 

22

    



  

(iii)  To the extent provided in an Award Agreement, the holder of
outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to be credited with
dividend equivalent payments (upon the payment by the Company of dividends
on shares of Common Stock) either in cash or, in the sole discretion of the
Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the
amount of such dividends (and interest may, in the sole discretion of the
Committee, be credited on the amount of cash dividend equivalents at a rate
and subject to such terms as determined by the Committee), which accumulated
dividend equivalents (and interest thereon, if applicable) shall be payable
at the same time as the underlying Restricted Stock Units are settled
following the date on which the Restricted Period lapses with respect to such
Restricted Stock Units, and if such Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, the
Participant shall have no right to such dividend equivalent payments (or
interest thereon, if applicable).

  



  

(d)   _Tax Withholding_.

  



  

(i)  A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, an amount in cash (by check or
wire transfer) equal to the aggregate amount of any income, employment, and/or
other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld in
respect of an Award. Alternatively, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may elect, in its sole discretion, to satisfy this requirement by withholding
such amount from any cash compensation or other cash amounts owing to a
Participant.

  



  

(ii)  Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may (but is
not obligated to), in its sole discretion, permit or require a Participant to
satisfy all or any portion of the minimum income, employment, and/or
other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld with
respect to an Award by: (A) the delivery of shares of Common Stock (which are
not subject to any pledge or other security interest) that have been both held
by the Participant and vested for at least six months (or such other period
as established from time to time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse
accounting treatment under applicable accounting standards) having an
aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such minimum statutorily
required withholding liability (or portion thereof); or (B) having the
Company withhold from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or
deliverable to, or that would otherwise be retained by, the Participant upon
the grant, exercise, vesting, or settlement of the Award, as applicable, a
number of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to
an amount, subject to clause (iii) below, not in excess of such minimum
statutorily required withholding liability (or portion thereof).

  



  

(iii) The Committee, subject to its having considered the
applicable accounting impact of any such determination, has full
discretion to allow Participants to satisfy, in whole or in part, any
additional income, employment, and/or other applicable taxes payable by them
with respect to an Award by electing to have the Company withhold from the
shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to, or that would
otherwise be retained by, a Participant upon the grant, exercise, vesting,
or settlement of the Award, as applicable, shares of Common Stock having an
aggregate Fair Market Value that is greater than the applicable minimum
required statutory withholding liability (but such withholding may in no event
be in excess of the maximum statutory withholding amount(s) in a
Participant's relevant tax jurisdictions).

(e)   _No Claim to Awards; No Rights to Continued Employment;
Waiver_. No employee of any member of the Company Group, or other Person,
shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan or,
having been selected for the grant of an Award, to be selected for a grant of
any other Award. There is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of
Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions
of Awards and the Committee's determinations and interpretations with respect
thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant and may be made
selectively among Participants, whether or not such Participants are
similarly situated. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall
be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ
or service of the Service Recipient or any other member of the Company Group,
nor shall it be construed as giving any Participant any rights to continued
service on the Board. The Service Recipient or any other member of the
Company Group may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or
discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any liability or any claim
under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or any
Award Agreement. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant shall
thereby be deemed to have waived any claim to continued exercise or vesting
of an Award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation
of the Award beyond the period provided under the Plan or any Award
Agreement, except to the extent of any provision to the contrary in any
written employment contract or other agreement between the Service Recipient
and/or any member of the Company Group and the Participant, whether any such
agreement is executed before, on, or after the Date of Grant.

  



  

(f)   _International Participants_. With respect to
Participants who reside or work outside of the United States of America, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan and create
or amend Sub-Plans or amend outstanding Awards with respect to such
Participants in order to permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by
such Participants, conform such terms with the requirements of Applicable Law
or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant or any
member of the Company Group.

  



  

(g) _Designation and Change of Beneficiary_. Each Participant
may file with the Committee a written designation of one or more Persons
as the beneficiary or beneficiaries, as applicable, who shall be entitled to
receive the amounts payable with respect to an Award, if any, due under the
Plan upon the Participant's death. A Participant may, from time to time,
revoke or change the Participant's beneficiary designation without the
consent of any prior beneficiary by filing a new designation with the
Committee. The last such designation received by the Committee shall be
controlling; _provided, however_ , that no designation, or change or
revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior
to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a
date prior to such receipt. If no beneficiary designation is filed by a
Participant, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Participant's spouse
or, if the Participant is unmarried at the time of death, the Participant's
estate.

  



  

   



 

24

    



  

(h)   _Termination_. Except as otherwise provided in an Award
Agreement, unless determined otherwise by the Committee at any point
following such event: (i) neither a temporary absence from employment or
service due to illness, vacation, or leave of absence (including, without
limitation, a call to active duty for military service through a Reserve or
National Guard unit) nor a transfer from employment or service with one
Service Recipient to employment or service with another Service Recipient (or
vice-versa) shall be considered a Termination; and (ii) if a Participant
undergoes a Termination, but such Participant continues to provide services
to the Company Group in a non-employee capacity, including as a consultant,
such change in status shall not be considered a Termination for purposes of
the Plan. Further, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event
that any Service Recipient ceases to be a member of the Company Group (by
reason of sale, divestiture, spin-off, or other similar transaction), unless
a Participant's employment or service is transferred to another entity that
would constitute a Service Recipient immediately following such transaction,
such Participant shall be deemed to have suffered a Termination hereunder as
of the date of the consummation of such transaction.

  



  

(i)   _No Rights as a Stockholder_. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Plan or any Award Agreement, no Person shall be
entitled to the privileges of ownership in respect of shares of Common Stock
that are subject to Awards hereunder until such shares have been issued or
delivered to such Person.

  



  

(j)   _Government and Other Regulations_.

  



  

(i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in shares of
Common Stock or other consideration shall be subject to compliance with
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the
contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to
sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any shares of
Common Stock pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly
registered for sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel
(if the Company has requested such an opinion), satisfactory to the Company,
that such shares may be offered or sold without such registration pursuant
to an available exemption therefrom and the terms and conditions of such
exemption have been fully complied with. The Company shall be under no
obligation to register for sale under the Securities Act any of the shares of
Common Stock to be offered or sold under the Plan. The Committee shall have
the authority to provide that all shares of Common Stock or other securities
of any member of the Company Group issued under the Plan shall be subject to
such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem
advisable under the Plan, the applicable Award Agreement and Applicable Law,
and, without limiting the generality of Section 8 of the Plan, the Committee
may cause a legend or legends to be put on certificates representing shares
of Common Stock or other securities of any member of the Company Group issued
under the Plan to make appropriate reference to such restrictions or may
cause such shares of Common Stock or other securities of any member of the
Company Group issued under the Plan in book-entry form to be held subject to
the Company's instructions or subject to appropriate stop-transfer orders.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the
Committee reserves the right to add, at any time, any additional terms or
provisions to any Award granted under the Plan that the Committee, in its
sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in order that such Award
complies with the legal requirements of any governmental entity to whose
jurisdiction the Award is subject.

  



  

   



 

25

    



  

(ii)  The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if
it determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or contractual restrictions
and/or blockage and/or other market considerations would make the
Company's acquisition of shares of Common Stock from the public markets, the
Company's issuance of Common Stock to the Participant, the Participant's
acquisition of Common Stock from the Company, and/or the Participant's sale of
Common Stock to the public markets, illegal, impracticable, or inadvisable.
If the Committee determines to cancel all or any portion of an Award
in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall, subject to any
limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code: (A) pay to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (I) the
aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such
Award or portion thereof canceled (determined as of the applicable exercise
date, or the date that the shares would have been vested or issued, as
applicable), over (II) the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price (in the
case of an Option or SAR, respectively) or any amount payable as a condition
of issuance of shares of Common Stock (in the case of any other Award), with
such amount being delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable
following the cancellation of such Award or portion thereof or (B) in the
case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based
Awards, provide the Participant with a cash payment or equity subject to
deferred vesting and delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions
applicable to such Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-
Based Awards, or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

  



  

(k)   _No Section 83(b) Elections Without Consent of Company_.
No election under Section 83(b) of the Code or under a similar provision of
law may be made unless expressly permitted by the terms of the applicable
Award Agreement or by action of the Committee (or its designee in accordance
with Section 4(c) of the Plan) in writing prior to the making of such
election. If a Participant, in connection with the acquisition of shares of
Common Stock under the Plan or otherwise, is expressly permitted to make such
election and the Participant makes the election, the Participant shall notify
the Company of such election within ten days of filing notice of the election
with the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority,
in addition to any filing and notification required pursuant to Section 83(b)
of the Code or other applicable provision.

  



  

(l)   _Payments to Persons Other Than Participants_. If the
Committee shall find that any Person to whom any amount is payable under the
Plan is unable to care for the Participant's affairs because of illness or
accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment due to such Person or
the Participant's estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a
duly appointed legal representative) may, if the Committee so directs the
Company, be paid to the Participant's spouse, child, relative, an institution
maintaining or having custody of such Person, or any other Person deemed by
the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such Person otherwise
entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the
liability of the Committee and the Company therefor.

  



  

   



 

26

    



  

(m)   _Nonexclusivity of the Plan_. Neither the adoption of the
Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the
Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the
power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem
desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of equity-based awards
otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable
generally or only in specific cases.

  



  

(n)   _No Trust or Fund Created_. Neither the Plan nor any Award
shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind
or a fiduciary relationship between any member of the Company Group, on the
one hand, and a Participant or other Person, on the other hand. No provision
of the Plan or any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose of
satisfying any obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any
assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or
otherwise to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company be obligated to
maintain separate bank accounts, books, records, or other evidence of the
existence of a segregated or separately maintained or administered fund
for such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under the Plan other
than as unsecured general creditors of the Company, except that insofar as
they may have become entitled to payment of additional compensation by
performance of services, they shall have the same rights as other service
providers under general law.

  



  

(o)   _Reliance on Reports_. Each member of the Committee and
each member of the Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to
act, as the case may be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or
failed to act in good faith, in reliance upon any report made by the
independent public accountant of any member of the Company Group and/or any
other information furnished in connection with the Plan by any agent of the
Company or the Committee or the Board, other than himself or herself.

  



  

(p)   _Relationship to Other Benefits_. No payment under the
Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any
pension, retirement, profit sharing, group insurance, or other benefit plan of
the Company except as otherwise specifically provided in such other plan or
as required by Applicable Law.

  



  

(q) _Governing Law_. THIS PLAN AND ITS ENFORCEMENT AND ANY
CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF [NEW YORK]. Each Participant who accepts an Award hereby (i)
agrees that any action, directly or indirectly, arising out of, under or
relating to the Plan or any Award hereunder shall exclusively be brought in
and shall exclusively be heard and determined by either the Supreme Court of
the State of [New York] sitting in [Manhattan or the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York], and (ii) solely in connection
with the action(s) contemplated by subsection (i) hereof, (A) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts identified in subsection (i) hereof, (B) irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue in any of the
courts identified in clause (i) of this Section 12(q), (C) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any of the courts
identified in such clause (i) is an inconvenient forum or does not have
personal jurisdiction over such Participant or any member of the
Company Group, and (D) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action in the manner provided herein or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof. EACH PARTICIPANT WHO ACCEPTS AN AWARD IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER
PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY OR AGAINST SUCH PARTICIPANT IN RESPECT OF THE
PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

  



  

   



 

27

    



  

(r)   _Severability_. If any provision of the Plan or any Award
or Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or
would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the
Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to
Applicable Law, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the
determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or
the Award, such provision shall be construed or deemed stricken as to such
jurisdiction, Person, or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such
Award shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

(s)   _Obligations Binding on Successors_. The obligations of
the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or
organization resulting from the merger, consolidation, or other
reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or
organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business
of the Company.

  



  

(t)   _Section 409A of the Code_.

  



  

(i)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary,
it is intended that the provisions of the Plan comply with Section 409A of
the Code, and all provisions of the Plan shall be construed and
interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes
or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Each Participant is solely
responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that
may be imposed on or in respect of such Participant in connection with the
Plan (including any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and
neither the Service Recipient nor any other member of the Company Group shall
have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold such Participant (or any
beneficiary) harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties. With
respect to any Award that is considered "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A of the Code, references in the Plan to "termination of
employment" (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean "separation from
service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, each of the payments that may be made in respect of
any Award granted under the Plan is designated as a separate payment.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if a
Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, no payments in respect of any Awards
that are "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code and
which would otherwise be payable upon the Participant's "separation
from service" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) shall be made to such
Participant prior to the date that is six months after the date of such
Participant's "separation from service" or, if earlier, the date of
the Participant's death. Following any applicable six-month delay, all such
delayed payments will be paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date
permitted under Section 409A of the Code that is also a business day.

  



  

   



 

28

    



  

(iii)  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award
Agreement or otherwise, in the event that the timing of payments in respect
of any Award (that would otherwise be considered "deferred
compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code) are accelerated upon the
occurrence of (A) a Change in Control, no such acceleration shall be
permitted unless the event giving rise to the Change in Control satisfies the
definition of a change in the ownership or effective control of a
corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
assets of a corporation pursuant to Section 409A of the Code or (B) a
Disability, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the Disability also
satisfies the definition of "Disability" pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code.

  



  

(u)   _Clawback/Repayment_. All Awards shall be subject to
reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent necessary to
comply with (i) any clawback, forfeiture or other similar policy adopted
by the Board or the Committee and as in effect from time to time; and (ii)
Applicable Law. Further, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to the
extent that the Participant receives any amount in excess of the amount that
the Participant should otherwise have received under the terms of the Award
for any reason (including, without limitation, by reason of a financial
restatement, mistake in calculations or other administrative error), the
Participant shall be required to repay any such excess amount to the Company.

  



  

(v)   _Detrimental Activity_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if a Participant has engaged in any Detrimental
Activity, as determined by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, provide for one or
more of the following:

  



  

(i)  cancellation of any or all of such Participant's
outstanding Awards; or

  



  

(ii)  forfeiture by the Participant of any gain realized on the
vesting or exercise of Awards, and repayment of any such gain promptly to the
Company.

  



  

(w)   _Right of Offset_. The Company will have the right to
offset against its obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock (or other
property or cash) under the Plan or any Award Agreement any outstanding
amounts (including, without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance
account balances, loans, repayment obligations under any Awards, or
amounts repayable to the Company pursuant to tax equalization, housing,
automobile, or other employee programs) that the Participant then owes to any
member of the Company Group and any amounts the Committee otherwise deems
appropriate pursuant to any tax equalization policy or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Award is "deferred compensation" subject
to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee will have no right to offset
against its obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock (or other
property or cash) under the Plan or any Award Agreement if such offset could
subject the Participant to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A of
the Code in respect of an outstanding Award.

  



  

   



 

29

    



     

(x)   _Expenses; Titles and Headings_. The expenses of
administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company Group. The titles and
headings of the sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only,
and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such
titles or headings, shall control.

Common Stock remains outstanding. All Class A Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation
and all Class A Common Stock issued as part of the Merger Agreement and the
Subscription Agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement shall be Common
Stock for all purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated,
is hereby amended, integrated and restated to read in its entirety as follows:

have authority to issue is [ ], which shall be divided into two classes
as follows:

  



   | (i)| [ ] shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (" _Common Stock_ "); and

to each such series, to fix, without further stockholder approval, the
number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series,
the powers (including voting powers), preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of such series
of Preferred Stock. The powers (including voting powers), preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights of, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of
Preferred Stock, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series at
any time outstanding.

   | 2.| Each holder of record of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled
to one vote for each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on
all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, including
the election or removal of directors. Except as otherwise required by law,
holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms
of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such
affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders
of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate
of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any
series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

   | 5.| Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
liabilities of the Corporation and subject to the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series
of stock having a preference over or the right to participate with the Common
Stock with respect to the distribution of assets of the Corporation upon such
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of

Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in
proportion to the number of shares held by them. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| The number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in
voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon
irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any
successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Common
Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required
therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this
Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock).

Article V _ 
 AMENDMENT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS_

  



  

A.  The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make,
alter, amend, change, add to, rescind or repeal, in whole or in part, the
bylaws of the Corporation (as in effect from time to time, the " _Bylaws_ ")
without the assent or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent
with the laws of the State of Delaware, this Certificate of Incorporation or
the Investor Rights Agreement.

Article VI

     

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

  



  

A.  Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Except as
otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement or
any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred Stock,
the total number of directors shall be determined from time to time
exclusively by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. The directors
(other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such
series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated
Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as
possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors. Class I
directors shall initially serve for a term expiring immediately following the
Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December
31, 2021, Class II directors shall initially serve for a term expiring
immediately following the Company's annual meeting of stockholders for the
calendar year ended December 31, 2022 and Class III directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring immediately following the Company's annual meeting
of stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. Commencing
with the annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year ended December
31, 2021, the directors of the class to be elected at each annual meeting
shall be elected for a three year term. If the number of such directors is
changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as
to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a
newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall
hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that
class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or
shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold
office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his
or her successor shall be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of
Directors is authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already
in office to their respective class.

  



  

B.  Without limiting the rights of any party to the Investor
Rights Agreement, any newly-created directorship on the Board of Directors
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board of Directors (whether by death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause) may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director or by the stockholders. Any
director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,

C.  Without limiting the rights of any party to the Investor
Rights Agreement, any or all of the directors (other than the directors
elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation,

continues: (i) the then otherwise total authorized number of directors of the
Corporation shall automatically be increased by such specified number of
directors, and the holders of such Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect
the additional directors so provided for or fixed pursuant to said

director's successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, or until
such director's right to hold such office terminates pursuant to said

establishing such series, whenever the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested
of such right pursuant to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office
of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or
elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation,
disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith

qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total authorized
number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced
accordingly.

A.  In recognition and anticipation that (i) certain directors,

Sponsor and its Affiliates (as defined below) may serve as directors, officers
or agents of the Corporation, (ii)  the Original Sponsor and its Affiliates,
including (I) any portfolio company in which they or any of their respective
investment fund Affiliates have made a debt or equity investment (and vice
versa) or (II) any of their respective limited partners, non-managing members
or other similar direct or indirect investors may now engage and may continue
to engage in the same or similar activities or related lines of business as
those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or
other business activities that overlap with or compete with those in which
the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage, and (iii) members of the

activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation,

set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the
Corporation with respect to certain classes or categories of business
opportunities as they may involve any of the Original Sponsor, the Non-
Employee Directors or their respective Affiliates and the powers, rights,
duties and liabilities of the Corporation and its directors, officers and
stockholders in connection therewith.

  



  

B. None of (i) the Original Sponsor or (ii) any Non-Employee
Director (including any Non-Employee Director who serves as an officer of the
Corporation in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her
Affiliates (the Persons (as defined below) identified in (i) and (ii) above
being referred to, collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and,
individually, as an " _Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1)
engaging in and possessing interests in other business ventures of every type
and description, including those engaged in the same or similar business
activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries now engages or proposes to engage or (2) competing with
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, on its own account, or in
partnership with, or as an employee, officer, director or shareholder of any
other Person, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Identified
Person shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or to any
Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason
of the fact that such Identified Person engages in any such activities. To
the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of
Delaware, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or
right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business
opportunity that may be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section (C)
of this _Article IX_. Subject to said Section (C) of this _Article IX_, in
the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a
potential transaction or matter that may be a corporate or other business
opportunity for such Identified Person or any of such Identified Person's
Affiliates, and the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, such Identified
Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have no duty
(fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) to communicate or present
such transaction or matter to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, as
the case may be and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or to any subsidiary of the
Corporation for breach of any duty (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) as a
stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation by reason of the
fact that such Identified Person, directly or indirectly, pursues or acquires
such opportunity for itself, herself or himself, directs such opportunity to
another Person or does not present such opportunity to the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries.

C.  The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any
corporate opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any
Non-Employee Director who serves as an officer of this Corporation) if such
opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of the Corporation, and the provisions of Section (B)
of this _Article IX_ shall not apply to any such corporate opportunity.

  



  

D.  In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Article IX_, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed
to be a potential corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a
business opportunity that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or
legally able, nor contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature,
is not in the line of the Corporation's business or is of no practical
advantage to the Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no
interest or reasonable expectancy.

  



  

E. For purposes of this _Article IX_, (i) " _Affiliate_ "
shall mean (a) in respect of the Original Sponsor, any Person that, directly
or indirectly, is controlled by the Original Sponsor (as applicable),
controls the Original Sponsor (as applicable) or is under common control with

is not owned by the interested stockholder, or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| the stockholder became an interested stockholder inadvertently and
(i) as soon as practicable divested itself of ownership of sufficient shares
so that the stockholder ceased to be an interested stockholder and (ii) was
not, at any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a business

to the Secretary not earlier than the Close of Business on the 120th
calendar day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting nor later than the Close of Business on the 90th calendar day prior
to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting

that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30
calendar days before or more than 70 calendar days after the anniversary date

annual meeting and not later than the Close of Business on the later of the
90th calendar day prior to the date of such annual meeting or the tenth

date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the
public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting
commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a
stockholder's notice as described above. For the avoidance of doubt, a
stockholder shall not be entitled to make additional or substitute
nominations following the expiration of the time periods set forth in
these Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything in this _____Section 2.03(A)(2)_ to
the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the
Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public
announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or
specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 calendar
days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting
of stockholders, then a stockholder's notice required by this _____Section
2.03_ shall be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any
new positions created by such increase, if it is received by the Secretary of
the Corporation not later than the Close of Business on the tenth calendar day
following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the

the Corporation entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at all
meetings of stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a separate
vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a majority in
voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or classes or

stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder by proxy in any manner provided by applicable law, but no such
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it
states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder
may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting
and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a
revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Unless required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law, or determined by the
chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any question need not be
by ballot. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the
stockholder voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, if there be such proxy.
When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in
person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter
shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is
one upon which, by express provision of applicable law, of the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, of any
regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, of the
Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a different vote is
required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence and subject
to the Certificate of Incorporation, all elections of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast in respect of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors.

place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation
determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the
Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If
the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the
list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole
time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be

Section 5.06   _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

  



  

(A)  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise
required by law, not be more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall
also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes
such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall
be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; _provided, however,_ that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case
shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned
meeting.

  



  

(B)  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or
allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to
such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

(C)  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation, in order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for determining
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting is fixed by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior action
of the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such
purpose shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by
the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for such purpose
shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner of such share
or shares. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof.

Section 6.02   _Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any notice,
signed by a stockholder or director, or waiver by electronic transmission by
such person, whether given before or after the time of the event for which
notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to the notice required to
be given to such person. Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting
need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance at any meeting (in person or
by remote communication) shall constitute waiver of notice except
attendance for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the

lawfully called or convened.

  



  

Article VII 
  
 Indemnification

  



  

Section 7.01 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is
made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter a  " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that
he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent
or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered
by such indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided, however,_ that, except
as provided in ___Section 7.03_ with respect to proceedings to
enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses or with respect
to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. Any reference to
an officer of the Corporation in this ___Article VII_ shall be deemed to
refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman, President,
Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the
Corporation appointed pursuant to ___Article IV_ of these Bylaws, and to any
Vice President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer, other officer of
the Corporation appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant to ___Article IV
_of these Bylaws or other person designated by the title of "Vice President"
of the Corporation, and any reference to an officer of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of
directors or equivalent governing body of such other entity pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational documents
of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise.

Section 7.02   _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the
right to indemnification conferred in ___Section 7.01_, an indemnitee shall
also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including
attorney's fees) incurred by the indemnitee in appearing at, participating in
or defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in
connection with a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this ___Article VII_ (which
shall be governed by ___Section 7.03_) (hereinafter an " _advancement of
expenses_ ");  _provided, however,_ that, if the DGCL requires or in the case
of an advance made in a proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to
indemnification or advancement, an advancement of expenses incurred by an
indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation
(and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit
plan) shall be made solely upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking
(hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter
a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified or entitled to advancement of expenses under ___Section
7.01_ and ___Section 7.02_ or otherwise.

  



  

Section 7.03 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under
___Section 7.01_ or ___Section 7.02 _is not paid in full by the Corporation
within (i) 60 days after a written claim for indemnification has been received
by the Corporation or (ii) 20 days after a claim for an advancement of
expenses has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim or to obtain advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, if successful in whole or in part in any such suit,
or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an
advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought
by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including by its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including by its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that
the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case
of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this ___Article VII _or otherwise shall
be on the Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.04   _Indemnification Not Exclusive_.

  



  

(A)  The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of
expenses and costs to any indemnitee under this ___Article VII_, or the
entitlement of any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses
and costs under this ___Article VII_, shall not limit or restrict in any way
the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to
such indemnitee in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of,
or invalidate, any right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such indemnitee's capacity as an officer, director, employee or
agent of the Corporation and as to action in any other capacity.

(B)  Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined
below) may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director or
officer of the Corporation at the request of the indemnitee-related entities
(as defined below), the Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible
for the payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement
of expenses in connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims,
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this ___Article
VII_, irrespective of any right of recovery the indemnitee may have from the
indemnitee-related entities. Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be
entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by the indemnitee-related
entities and no right of advancement or recovery the indemnitee may have from
the indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of
the indemnitee or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder. In the event
that any of the indemnitee-related entities shall make any payment to the
indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with
respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity
making such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all
of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the
indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all
things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the
execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-
related entities effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the
indemnitee-related entities shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect
to this ___Section 7.04(B)_ of ___Article VII_, entitled to enforce this
___Section 7.04(B)_ of ___Article VII_.

  



     

For purposes of this  __ _Section 7.04(B)_ of ___Article VII_, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

  



  

(1)  The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any
other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has
agreed, on behalf of the Corporation or at the Corporation's request, to
serve as a director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered
by the indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation.

  



  

(2)  The term "j _ointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be
broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or
proceeding for which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses from both the indemnitee-related entities and the
Corporation pursuant to Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or
comparable organizational documents of the Corporation or the indemnitee-
related entities, as applicable.

  



  

Section 7.05   _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon
indemnitees in this ___Article VII_ shall be contract rights and such rights
shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and
administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this  __ _Article
VII_ that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall
be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right
with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence
of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or
repeal.

  



  

Section 7.06   _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7.07   _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation_. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this ___Article VII_ with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.
