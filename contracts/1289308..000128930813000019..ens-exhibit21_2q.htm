corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
Purcell Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and with
respect to Article VII only, Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability

herein shall have the meaning set forth in Section 9.2.

RECITALS

A. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative have previously
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 15, 2013
(the "Prior Agreement").

B. The parties to the Prior Agreement believe it is in the best interests of
all parties to effect certain changes to the terms of the Prior Agreement by
amending and restating the Prior Agreement as set forth in this Agreement,
effective as of the date of this Agreement.

C. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders that Parent and the Company consummate the
business combination and other transactions provided for herein.

D. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved, in accordance with applicable provisions of the laws of the
state of Delaware, including the DGCL ("Delaware Law"), this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

E. As a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this
Agreement and to complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company has secured and delivered to Parent a written consent
irrevocably (1) adopting the Prior Agreement and (2) approving the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Prior Agreement,
including, but not limited to, the Merger, in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Written Consent"), from the holders of (a) at least
seventy seven percent (77%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
Capital Stock, voting together as a single class on an as converted into
Common Stock basis, and (b) ninety percent (90%) of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an

F. Concurrently with, and as a condition to, the Closing, Parent, the Company,
the Representative and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (with such changes as
the Escrow Agent may reasonably request and which Parent and the
Representative shall have approved the "Escrow Agreement") to become effective
upon the Closing, pursuant to which a portion of the aggregate Merger





Consideration otherwise payable to holders of Company Securities shall be
placed in an escrow account at the Closing to secure the obligations set forth
in Section 1.6(h)(vi) and Article VII.

G. Concurrently with, and as a condition to, the Closing, Parent and each
Designated Person shall have entered into an Agreement Not to Compete in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Non-Competition
Agreement"), to become effective upon the Closing.

H. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree to amend and restate in its entirety the Prior Agreement as
follows:

Article I 

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving
corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."

1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D
(the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time
of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such
later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified
in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined below). The closing of
the Merger (the "Closing") will be coordinated by means of overnight delivery,
electronic mail or facsimile (rather than by means of the attendance of the
parties hereto in person) at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation, located at 701 Fifth Avenue, Suite 5100, Seattle,
Washington on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those that by their terms are
to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), or at such other time, date and location as the
parties hereto agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law, including Section 259 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
as amended ("DGCL"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub, until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as





provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the
Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
"The name of the corporation is "Purcell Systems, Inc." and the Certificate of
Incorporation shall be amended so as to comply with Section 5.8(b). At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such
Bylaws; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, if necessary, the
Bylaws shall be amended so as to comply with Section 5.8(b).

1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.
The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

1.6 Effect on Company Securities.

(a) Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of Capital
Stock of the Company, the following shall occur:

(i) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(e), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Amount, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Series A Preferred
Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and indemnity, if
required in the manner provided in Section 1.9).

(ii) Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 1.6(e) will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Amount, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Series B Preferred
Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and indemnity, if
required in the manner provided in Section 1.9).

(iii) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
1.6(e) will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive, without interest, the Per Share Amount, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such share of Common Stock in the manner provided
in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit and indemnity, if required in the manner
provided in Section 1.9).

(b) Stock Options. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any Company Options, each Company Option, will be converted into and will
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to
each share of Common Stock subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price of such Company Option
(such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration"), and
each such Company Option will automatically and irrevocably terminate at the
Effective Time. The payment of the Option Consideration to the holder of a
Company Option will be reduced by any required tax withholdings.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6(b) to the contrary, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions anticipated by this Section 1.6(b) under all Company Option
agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company (whether written
or oral, formal or informal), including delivering all required notices and
obtaining all waivers or consents from the holders of the Company Options
which are necessary to cause the Company Options to terminate at the Effective
Time as provided in this





Section 1.6(b), which waivers and consents, if any, shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent in all respects.

(c) Warrant Termination. Upon the Effective Time, the Company Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount of cash, without interest, with respect to each
share of Capital Stock underlying such Company Warrant, equal to the excess of
the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per share of such Company Warrant
(the "Warrant Termination Amount").

(d) Calculations. For purposes of calculating the amount of cash to be paid to
each Company Stockholder and each holder of outstanding Company Options and/or
outstanding Company Warrants pursuant to this Section 1.6, respectively, all
amounts payable to such holder (without rounding) shall be aggregated and
after such aggregation, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole
cent. For purposes of illustration, the distribution provisions set forth in
this Section 1.6 are intended to result in the distribution of the Merger
Consideration substantially in the manner set forth in Schedule 1.6(d), which
may be updated by the Company at the Closing and the Representative following
the Closing to update the estimated amounts set forth therein with the actual
amounts.

(e) Cancellation of Treasury and Company Owned Stock. Each share of Capital
Stock held by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

(f) [Intentionally Omitted]

(g) Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) validly issued fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

(h) Merger Consideration Adjustment.

(i) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
basis consistent with the Company Balance Sheet and the principles and
methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.6(h) and setting forth the Company's
good faith estimate of the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the
Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and (B) a statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail (1) a good
faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital based on the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), (2)
the amount of the Closing Working Capital Deficit, if any, based on the amount
of the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working
Capital Deficit"), or the amount of the Closing Working Capital Surplus, if
any, based on the amount of the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the
"Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus"), (3) the Total Debt Amount,
comprising the Closing Debt Amount determined by reference to the pay-off
letters referred to in Section 6.3(d)(i) and the Post-Closing Debt Amount
determined by reference to the debt confirmation letter referred to in Section
6.3(d)(ii), (4) the Closing Transaction Expenses (if any) that are unpaid as
of the Closing determined by reference to the invoices, statements and
releases referred to in Section 6.3(d)(iii), and (5) a good faith estimate of
the Closing Cash Amount based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (the
"Estimated Closing Cash Amount"). At the time of the Closing, the Merger
Consideration shall be calculated based upon the Total Debt Amount (comprising
the Closing Debt Amount determined by reference to the pay-off letters
referred to in Section 6.3(d)(i) and the Post-Closing Debt Amount determined
by reference to the debt confirmation letter referred to in Section
6.3(d)(ii)), the Closing Transaction Expenses (if any) that are unpaid as of
the Closing (determined by reference to the invoices, statements, and releases
referred to in Section 6.3(d)(iii)), the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Deficit (if any), the Estimated Closing Working Capital Surplus (if any) and
the Estimated Closing Cash Amount as set forth in the Estimated Closing
Statement, subject to the





reasonable review and approval of Parent, and the Company shall (I) provide
Parent and the authorized representatives of Parent copies of, or reasonable
access during normal business hours to, all relevant financial information to
the extent required to complete Parent's review of the Estimated Closing
Statement and (II) cooperate with the reasonable requests of Parent and the
authorized representatives of Parent with respect to the review of the
Estimated Closing Statement, including by providing all information reasonably
necessary in reviewing the Estimated Closing Statement.

(ii) Within sixty (60) Business Days following the Closing, Parent shall (A)
prepare (or caused to be prepared) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and a statement (the
"Closing Statement" and, together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the "Closing
Financial Data") indicating Parent's calculation (based on the Closing Balance
Sheet and consistent with the definitions and terms set forth in this
Agreement) of the Closing Working Capital Components and reconciling the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Deficit (if any), the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Surplus (if any) and the Estimated Closing Cash Amount as set
forth in the Estimated Closing Statement and (B) deliver a copy of the Closing
Financial Data to the Representative. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
Company Balance Sheet and the principles and methodologies set forth on
Schedule 1.6(h). Following such sixty (60) Business Day period, Parent shall
be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Company's calculation of each
Closing Working Capital Component as set forth in the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement except with respect to each
individual Closing Working Capital Component that is expressly disputed during
such period by Parent in the Closing Financial Data and any undisputed Closing
Working Capital Components shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive on
Parent; provided, however, that Parent shall be deemed to have expressly
disputed any Closing Working Capital Component if and to the extent that the
net amount of such Closing Working Capital Component as set forth in the
Closing Financial Data varies from the net amount of such Closing Working
Capital Component as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement.

(iii) After receipt of the Closing Financial Data, the Representative shall
have thirty (30) Business Days to review the Closing Financial Data. Parent
shall (A) provide the Representative and the authorized representatives of the
Representative copies of, or reasonable access during normal business hours
to, all relevant financial information to the extent required to complete the
Representative's review of the Closing Financial Data and (B) cooperate with
the reasonable requests of the Representative and the authorized
representatives of the Representative with respect to the review of the
Closing Financial Data, including by providing all information reasonably
necessary in reviewing the Closing Financial Data. Unless the Representative
delivers a written dispute notice signed by the Representative to Parent on or
prior to the thirtieth (30th) Business Day after the Representative's receipt
of the Closing Financial Data (a "Dispute Notice") disputing that the Closing
Financial Data is not mathematically correct, or was not prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Company Balance
Sheet and the principles and methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.6(h), then
the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to, on behalf
of the Company Securityholders and the Other Participants, Parent's
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Components as set forth in the
Closing Financial Data, and such calculation shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Parent, the Company, all Company Securityholders and the Other
Participants.

(iv) If the Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice, the
Representative and Parent shall, within thirty (30) Business Days (or such
longer period as Parent and the Representative may agree in writing) following
receipt of such Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good
faith to resolve their differences and any resolution in writing signed by
each of them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

(v) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are any amounts
remaining in dispute, then such amounts remaining in dispute may be submitted
by either the Representative or Parent for binding resolution to a nationally
recognized independent certified public accounting firm (which firm shall be
subject to the mutual approval of Parent and the Representative and may not be
Parent's independent registered certified public accounting firm or perform
audit services for the Representative, or any Company Securityholders





holding more than ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding Company
Securities, as determined on a fully-diluted basis, immediately prior to the
Effective Time), appointed by the mutual agreement of Parent and the
Representative (the "Independent Accountant") within ten (10) Business Days
after the expiration of the Resolution Period. The Independent Accountant
shall act as an arbitrator to determine whether the Closing Working Capital
Components set forth in the Closing Financial Data that remain disputed
following the Resolution Period (the "Disputed Components") are not
mathematically correct or were not prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a basis consistent with the Company Balance Sheet and the principles and
methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.6(h) by choosing the position of Parent
or the Representative. The Independent Accountant shall not have the authority
to determine the accuracy of any Closing Working Capital Components other than
the Disputed Components and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not have the
authority to alter any Closing Working Capital Component in favor of a party
if such Closing Working Capital Component has become final, binding and
conclusive on such party pursuant to this Section 1.6(h) or has been resolved
by Parent and the Representative in writing during the Resolution Period. The
Independent Accountant's resolution of the Disputed Components shall be made
within twenty (20) Business Days following its engagement, shall be set forth
in a written statement delivered to the Representative and Parent and shall be
final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid (A) out of the
Representative Fund if the amount of the Merger Consideration calculated after
substituting for the Disputed Amounts the Independent Accountant's calculation
of such Disputed Amounts, is closer to the amount of the Merger Consideration
last proposed by Parent and (B) by Parent if the amount of the Merger
Consideration calculated after substituting for the Disputed Amounts the
Independent Accountant's calculation of such Disputed Amounts, is closer to
the amount of the Merger Consideration last proposed by the Stockholders
Representative.

(vi) If it is determined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.6(h) that the Closing Working Capital Components as calculated by the
Company and set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement shall have been
inaccurate, then (A) if such inaccuracy resulted in the Merger Consideration
being overstated, Parent shall be entitled to deduct, from the Working Capital
Fund, the amount by which the Merger Consideration shall have been overstated
(the "Merger Consideration Excess Amount") and (B) if such inaccuracy resulted
in the Merger Consideration being understated, Parent shall deliver to the
Company Securityholders and the Other Participants (pursuant to the written
instructions from the Representative) the amount by which the Merger
Consideration was understated (the "Merger Consideration Shortfall Amount"),
less the Pro Rata Portion thereof allocable to any Company Securityholder
which has theretofore failed to comply with Section 1.7, and the

such indebtedness, and the Company Securityholders shall have no liability to
Parent for the Post-Closing Debt Amount.

(c) Exchange Procedures. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the

instruments (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates by the Company Stockholders to Parent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for cash
constituting the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration (less the
amounts of cash to be deposited in the Escrow Fund, the Working Capital Fund
and the Representative Fund with respect to shares of Company Securities of
such Company Securityholder in accordance with Section 1.7(b)), including a
means of hand-delivery. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
Parent required for all Company Stockholders, together with such letter of

instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
Parent for all Company Securityholders, the holder of record of such Company

Stockholders shall forthwith be canceled. Parent shall make the foregoing
payment by check or wire transfer (as elected by such Company Securityholder):

least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to Parent along with
the materials required by this Section 1.7(c), on the Closing Date and (B)
with respect to Certificates and transmittal letters that are delivered less
than three (3) Business Days prior to, or on or after, the Closing Date to
Parent along with the materials required by this Section 1.7(c), within two
(2) Business Days after delivery of such materials to Parent. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the ownership of
the portion of the Merger Consideration into which such securities shall have
been so converted.

(d) Required Withholding. The Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as
appropriate, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Capital Stock, Company Options, or Company Warrants or to any
Other Participants such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, provided that any
amounts so withheld are promptly paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over,
the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all





purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to
a holder of shares of Capital Stock or any Company Option or Company Warrant
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements.

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. Parent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of the
Company Securities pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to holders of the Company
Securities pursuant to this Article I shall be paid to Parent.

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any holders of the Certificates who have not
surrendered such Certificates and letters of transmittal in compliance with
this Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for the amount of cash constituting
the portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a) with
respect to the shares of Capital Stock, Company Options, or Company Warrants
formerly represented thereby. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity, any such portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of the Company Securities
immediately prior to twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. Subject in all respects to
the provisions of the last sentence of Section 1.7(c), all cash paid upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Capital Stock, Company Options and Company
Warrants in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Capital
Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Article I.

1.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall transfer in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact, which shall include usual and customary indemnities in
favor of the Surviving Corporation, by the holder thereof, such amount of cash
constituting the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) with respect to the shares of Capital Stock, Company Options or
Company Warrants formerly represented thereby.

1.10 Further Action. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

waived with respect to such Company Participants and shall provide them with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments)
made during the plan year which includes the Closing Date for the purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements
under any Parent employee benefit plans or arrangements in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date.

(b) Payment of Certain Severance Obligations. Parent agrees to assume, and/or
cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the severance obligations payable to
only those Employees of the Company set forth on Schedule 5.7(b) upon
termination of each such Employee's employment pursuant to the terms of the
written Contracts with each such Employee as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be obligated to pay (i) any such severance to the extent that such
severance is comprised of, or determined based on, the Accrued Bonuses or (ii)
any of the Severance Payments to any of the Other Participants. Parent also
agrees to assume, and/or cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, any
severance obligations payable to Employees of the Company who become employees
of the Surviving Corporation (except the Other Participants) that would have
been paid by the Company to such Employees in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice upon the termination of each such Employee's
employment, in accordance with the severance policies as set forth on Schedule
5.7(b) following the Closing.

5.8 Indemnification.

(a) For the period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement, in each case to the extent actually and
reasonably incurred (the "Company Indemnified Liabilities") in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by reason of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or relating (directly or indirectly) to such person's duties as
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after the Effective
Time excluding, however, all Company Indemnified Liabilities based on, or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Company Indemnified Proceedings"), in each case to the full extent a
corporation is permitted by applicable Legal Requirements to indemnify its own
directors and officers, but only if and to the extent that such Company
Indemnified Parties, in their capacity as an officer or director of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, met





the applicable standard of conduct prescribed for indemnification under (i)
the Company Charter Documents or the Subsidiary Charter Documents, as
appropriate, (ii) applicable Legal Requirements, or (iii) the directors' and
officers' or any similar liability insurance maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, in effect at the time of the act or omission
giving rise to such claim for indemnification. In the event any Company
Indemnified Party is or becomes involved in any Company Indemnified
Proceeding, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such Company Indemnified
Proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Company Indemnified
Proceeding is brought against any Company Indemnified Party, (A) the Company
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel of their choosing, (B) Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of one counsel for all of the Company Indemnified Parties
with respect to each such Company Indemnified Proceeding unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified
Parties, in which case Parent shall pay the fees of such additional counsel
required by such conflict, promptly as statements therefor are received; and
(C) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in the defense of any such matters; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement of any claim effected without its written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Company Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.8(a) upon becoming aware
of any such Company Indemnified Proceeding shall promptly notify Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (but the failure to so notify Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from any liability it may have under this Section 5.8(a) except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Parent or the Surviving Corporation), and
shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving Corporation the undertaking
contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company pursuant to the indemnification agreements
between the Company and the Company Indemnified Parties identified in Section
2.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, subject to applicable Legal
Requirements. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at
least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the Company Indemnified Parties.

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain directors' and officers' liability
insurance, or purchase a "tail" policy for such insurance, covering those
Persons who are covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy as of the date hereof in an amount and on terms no less
favorable than coverage under such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement and those applicable to the current directors and officers of the
Company. The premium for any such insurance policy maintained by the Company
will constitute a portion of the Closing Transaction Expenses payable out of
the Merger Consideration at the Closing.

(d) This Section 5.8 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its successors and assigns and shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as appropriate, will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause proper provision to be made so that
the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, agrees to honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.8.





5.9 Certain Tax Matters. If the Company is obligated to make any payments, or
is a party to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate it
to make any payments, that will not be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code if the stockholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) are not
satisfied (including those payments comprised of the Severance Payments and
the Change of Control Payments but excluding the employer payroll portion of
such Change of Control Payments and Severance Payments), then, on or prior to
the Closing, the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent a waiver from each
other Person who is a party to such Contract pursuant to which such Person
will waive his or her right to any such payments to the extent such payments
constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of the Code, unless such
stockholder approval is obtained, and if that stockholder approval has not
already been obtained, Parent agrees that it shall cooperate and assist the
Company in obtaining the requisite stockholder approval described in Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, and the Company agrees to use commercially
reasonably efforts to obtain such stockholder approval promptly after the date
hereof and in any event prior to the Closing Date.

5.10 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth herein, if the Merger is
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the
respective party incurring such expenses. On behalf of the Company, at the
Closing, the Parent shall pay the Closing Transaction Expenses that remain
unpaid as of the Closing, including the portion of the Change of Control
Payments outstanding as of the Closing, and the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration payable to the Company Securityholders at the Closing will be
reduced, on a Dollar-for-Dollar basis, by the amount of all such Closing
Transaction Expenses paid by the Parent on behalf of the Company at Closing as
provided in Section 1.7(b).

5.11 FIRPTA Compliance. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
for purposes of satisfying Parent's obligations under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

5.12 Third Party Consents. Except for the Necessary Consents and the consents
set forth on Schedule 6.1(d) (to the extent not waived by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.4), Parent acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with
respect to the Merger may be required from parties to Contracts to which the
Company is a party and that such consents and waivers have not been obtained.
Parent agrees that the Company and its affiliates shall not have any liability
whatsoever to Parent arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents or waivers that may be required in connection with the Merger, other
than any consent that would constitute a breach of Section 2.3(d) or Section
1.6(d), or because of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof.
Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate with Parent, upon the
request of Parent, in any reasonable manner in connection with Parent
obtaining any such consents and waivers; provided that such cooperation shall
not include any requirement of the Company or any of its affiliates to expend
money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third Person.

5.13 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all
of Merger Sub's obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the Merger.

5.14 Tax Matters.

(a) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date and such
Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed consistent with past practice, except
as required by any Legal Requirement.

(b) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (including any periods beginning before and ending after the Closing
Date as allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to the definition of
"Unpaid Pre-Closing





Taxes") that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and such Tax
Returns shall be prepared and filed consistent with past practice, except as
required by any Legal Requirement. To the extent that any such Tax Return
could give rise to an indemnity claim under Article VII hereof, Parent shall
submit such Tax Return to the Representative for review and approval at least
fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

(c) Except to the extent required by any Legal Requirement, with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall not make any elections relating to
the Company or file any amended Tax Return of the Company solely for the
purpose of triggering an indemnity claim under Article VII hereof.

(d) Parent and the Representative agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as reasonably promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to
the Company as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return
(including any report required pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements), for
the preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Parent and the
Representative agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to retain or cause
to be retained all books and records pertinent to the Company until the
applicable period for assessment under applicable Legal Requirements (giving
effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or
cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Entity.

ARTICLE VII 

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY ESCROW

7.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement other than the
Fundamental Representations (the "General Representations") shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and continue until the expiration of the eighteen
(18) month period immediately following the Closing Date (the "General
Representations Termination Date"), after which time such representations and
warranties shall terminate. The representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Sections 2.1(a) (Organization), 2.2 (Capitalization), 2.3(a)
(Authority), 2.7 (Taxes), 2.8 (Intellectual Property), 2.11 (Brokers' and
Finders' Fee), 2.12 (Employee Benefits Plans), 2.14 (Assets) and 2.15
(Environmental Matters) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations")
shall survive until the date that is the three (3) year anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Escrow Termination Date"), after which time such
representations and warranties shall terminate. In the event of fraud with
respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby by
any Company Securityholder, the Representative or any other Person or any
breach of any provision of a Non-Competition Agreement by the Designated
Person party thereto, all claims of the Indemnified Parties shall survive
indefinitely with respect to any such fraud or breach committed by such
Person.





Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims made pursuant to an
Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Representative on
or prior to the General Representations Termination Date for any breach of any
General Representations and on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date for any
breach of any Fundamental Representations, the representations and warranties
with respect to such claims shall survive (but only for the purpose of
pursuing such claims) until such claims are finally resolved pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. The agreements, covenants and other obligations of the
parties hereto shall survive the Closing and the Effective Time in accordance
with their respective terms or, absent such terms, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements.

7.2 Escrow Amount Deposit; Representative Escrow Amount Deposit. Promptly
following the Closing, and without any act of any stockholder of the Company,
Parent shall, as provided in Section 1.7(b), pay and deposit from the Merger
Consideration an amount of cash equal to the Escrow Amount and the Working
Capital Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent and an amount of cash equal to the
Representative Escrow Amount with the Representative. For purposes of
determining the reduction in the amount of the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to each Company Securityholder pursuant to Section 1.6(a) through
Section 1.6(c), as applicable, Parent will be deemed to have contributed on
behalf of each Company Securityholder, his, her or its (a) Pro Rata Portion of
the Adjusted Escrow Amount and the Adjusted Working Capital Escrow Amount to
the Escrow Fund to be governed under the terms set forth in this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and (b) Pro Rata Portion of the Adjusted Representative
Escrow Amount to the Representative Fund. The parties hereto agree that, for
Tax purposes, Parent is the owner of any cash in the Escrow Fund and Working
Capital Fund and the Company Securityholders are the owners of any cash in the
Representative Fund. All interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned
from the investment of cash in the Escrow Fund and Working Capital Fund
pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be treated for Tax
purposes as earned by Parent. All interest on or other taxable income, if any,
earned from the investment of cash in the Representative Fund pursuant to this
Agreement or the Representative Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as
earned by the Representative. Upon release of the cash in the Escrow Fund and
Working Capital Fund, a portion of any cash distributed to the Company
Securityholders, Lazard and Other Participants shall be treated as interest
under the imputed interest rules of the Code.

7.3 Indemnification From Escrow Fund and Working Capital Fund; Representative
Fund.

(n) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the
Escrow Fund, without duplication, the amount of any Losses suffered or
incurred by each such Indemnified Party resulting from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article II of this
Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter except as otherwise
provided in Section 4.2) (except for breaches of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.19 (Warranty Claims), which
are indemnifiable and recoverable from the Escrow Fund pursuant to clause (iv)
of this Section 7.3(a)), and in each case read without regard to any
qualifications or limitations to any of the Company's representations or
warranties based upon materiality or Material Adverse Effect, other than the
representation and warranty set forth in Section 2.6(a), (ii) any failure by
(A) the Company to perform or comply with any covenant of the Company
contained in this Agreement prior to the Closing Date or (B) the
Representative to perform or comply with any covenant of the Representative
contained in this Agreement, (iii) any Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes and (iv) any
(A) breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
Section 2.19 (Warranty Claims), in each case read without regard to any
qualifications or limitations to any of such representations or warranties of
the Company based upon materiality and (B) claim asserted by any Person at any
time prior to the Escrow Termination Date alleging, in whole or in part, that
any product (including any Company Product) which was sold or shipped by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective predecessors in
interest) prior to the Closing Date is defective or fails to conform in any
respect with any guarantee or warranty (whether express or implied) regarding
the workmanship, materials, quality, performance or specifications of any such
products, including any claims for the repair or replacement of such products
or for a refund of the cost thereof (collectively, "Warranty Claims"). Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to recover from the Working Capital Fund the Merger
Consideration Excess Amount, if applicable. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Representative Fund shall be available to
the Representative to cover (I) the fees of the Independent Accountant
pursuant to Section 1.6(h)(v) if applicable, (II) the Representative Losses
and expenses incurred by the





Representative and (III) the expenses and fees of counsel or other skilled
professionals for the Representative if it elects to undertake the defense of
any Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 7.7.

(o) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow Fund
shall not be available to compensate any of the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) for breaches of (i) the
General Representations or (ii) those Fundamental Representations set forth in
Section 2.7 (Taxes) and Section 2.8 (Intellectual Property), and no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund for such
breaches, unless and until the Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) for breaches of the General
Representations or breaches of those Fundamental Representations set forth in
Section 2.7 (Taxes) and Section 2.8 (Intellectual Property), in excess of Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) in the aggregate (the "Basket
Amount"); provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Fund for any Losses for any Warranty Claims unless and
until the Indemnified Parties have incurred aggregate Losses with respect to
such Warranty Claims in excess of the amount set forth on Schedule 7.3(b)(i)
during any applicable Warranty Claim Period (the "Warranty Deductible"). Once
the total of all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) incurred
by the Indemnified Parties with respect to breaches of the General
Representations or the Fundamental Representations set forth in Section 2.7
(Taxes) and Section 2.8 (Intellectual Property) exceeds the Basket Amount, the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund for the
entire amount of all such Losses incurred (including those taken into account
in determining the Basket Amount). With respect to Warranty Claims, the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund only the
amount of Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(iv) in excess of the
Warranty Deductible for each separate Warranty Claim Period and, accordingly,
all Losses for Warranty Claims sustained, incurred or accrued during any
Warranty Claim Period shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether
the Warranty Deductible has been exceeded for such Warranty Claim Period. All
Losses attributable to Warranty Claims shall (A) be determined without regard
to any general or specific reserves for warranty claims included in the
Financial Statements or otherwise reflected on the Company's books of account
and (B) also include Losses incurred in connection with the matters set forth
on Schedule 7.3(b)(ii). The Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for Losses attributable to Warranty Claims regardless of the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 2.19. Despite anything to the contrary set forth in this Article VII,
the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(b) shall not apply in the event
of fraud or any Losses resulting from a breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations (other than the Fundamental Representations set forth in
Section 2.7 (Taxes) and Section 2.8 (Intellectual Property)) or any claims for
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(ii) or Section 7.3(a)(iii).

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) in the
event that any Losses which an Indemnified Party is otherwise entitled to
recover from the Escrow Fund (A) are covered by insurance which was heretofore
or is hereafter maintained by or for the benefit of the Indemnified Party or
(B) result in a current, cash Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party, the amount
of any "Losses" that the Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
recover from the Escrow Fund will be reduced by the amount of (1) any
insurance proceeds actually received by, or actually paid to a third party for
the benefit of, the Indemnified Party less (I) any reasonable costs of the
collection of such insurance and (II) any actual premium increase attributable
to the claim with respect to which such insurance proceeds are paid and (2)
any such current, cash Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party,
as appropriate; (ii) no Losses shall be recoverable from the Escrow Fund
hereunder that would have been avoided through commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate such Losses which were not taken by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and/or the Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3(c), in no event
shall any Indemnified Party be obligated or required to take any action to
pursue any insurance or realize any current, cash Tax benefit with respect to
any Losses suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Party as a condition to
recovering any amounts from the Escrow Fund for or on account of such Losses
or otherwise; and (iii) the amount of any Loss subject to recovery under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of any amounts specifically accrued or
reserved for in the final Closing Balance Sheet with respect to the fact or
matter giving rise to the claim resulting in such Losses.

(q) All claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Escrow Fund and
the Working Capital Fund shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and
be governed by the terms of, this Agreement





and the Escrow Agreement. All claims for recovery from the Representative Fund
shall be made in accordance with, and governed by the terms of, this Agreement
and the Representative Agreement.

(r) The Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any knowledge (whether actual or constructive) acquired, or
capable of being acquired by any of the Indemnified Parties or their
respective representatives from any source (including the Virtual Data Room),
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of,
or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.
The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such representation
or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any such covenant or
agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or any other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements.

7.4 Exclusive Remedy. Recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties for any Losses incurred by any
Indemnified Party or otherwise arising in connection with this Agreement
except for the matters recoverable from the Working Capital Fund as set forth
in Section 7.3(a) and as otherwise hereinafter provided in this Section 7.4.
If the Merger Consideration Excess Amount exceeds the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, the Company Securityholders and Other Participants shall, severally
and not jointly, make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction
of such amount; provided that no Company Securityholder or Other Participant's
obligation hereunder shall exceed such Company Securityholder's or Other
Participant's proportionate amount of such obligation, based on the
consideration actually received by all Company Securityholders and Other
Participants pursuant to this Agreement and the Change of Control Agreements.
Except for fraud and for breaches by a Designated Person of his or its Non-
Competition Agreement, in which case the Indemnified Parties shall have the
right to proceed directly against such Person committing such fraud or breach
of such Non-Competition Agreement, no Company Securityholder or Other
Participant shall be liable to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Indemnified Party for any damages or other remedies arising out of, in
connection with or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein.

7.5 Distribution of Escrow Fund, Working Capital Fund and Representative Fund.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Fund shall promptly be delivered to the Company Securityholders, Other
Participants and Lazard on the Escrow Termination Date; provided, however,
that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate with respect to any amount which is
necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officer's
Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Representative (i) on or
prior to the General Representations Termination Date with respect to claims
for breaches of the General Representations or (ii) the Escrow Termination
Date with respect to (A) claims for breaches of the Fundamental
Representations, (B) claims for breach of covenants pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(ii), (C) claims for Unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(iii) and (D) Warranty Claims (except for claims pursuant to Section
2.19 which shall terminate pursuant to Section 7.5(a)(i)), pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(iv), as applicable. As soon as all such claims have been resolved, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund (if any)
not required to satisfy such claims to the Company Securityholders, the Other
Participants and Lazard in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement.

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the Working
Capital Fund (if any) shall promptly be delivered to the Company
Securityholders and Other Participants in accordance with the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement following (i) the expiration of the thirty (30) Business
Day period immediately following the Closing Date if the parties shall have
agreed that the Estimated Closing Statement Sheet shall have been accurate in
accordance with Section 1.6(h) or (ii) the payment of the Merger Consideration
Excess Amount or Merger Consideration Shortfall Amount, as applicable, if the
Estimated Closing Statement Sheet shall have not been accurate in accordance
with Section 1.6(h).





(e) Upon the completion of the Representative's duties hereunder, the
Representative shall wire any remaining amount in the Representative Fund to
the Escrow Agent and direct the Escrow Agent to distribute such amounts to the
Company Securityholders, Other Participants and Lazard in accordance with the
provisions of the Representative Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(f) If and only to the extent that the Company Securityholders become entitled
to receive funds from the Escrow Fund, the Working Capital Fund or the
Representative Fund in accordance with Sections 7.5(a), 7.5(b) or 7.5(c),
respectively, deliveries from the Escrow Fund, Working Capital Fund and
Representative Fund to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Section
7.5, the Escrow Agreement and the Representative Agreement shall be made in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Adjusted
Escrow Amount, remaining Adjusted Working Capital Escrow Amount and remaining
Adjusted Representative Escrow Amount, with each amount rounded to the nearest
whole cent ($0.01). Deliveries of the Escrowed Transaction Expenses from the
Escrow Fund, the Escrowed Working Capital Transaction Expenses from the
Working Capital Fund and the Escrowed Representative Transaction Expenses from
the Representative Fund to the Other Participants and Lazard, as applicable
pursuant to this Section 7.5, shall be made in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and the agreements with each respective Other Participant and
Lazard, as applicable, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole cent
($0.01).

7.6 Representative.

(e) Designation of Representative; Authority and Rights of Representative. By
virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite vote of
the Company Securityholders, each of the Company Securityholders shall be
deemed to have agreed to irrevocably appoint Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, as the initial Representative to be its agent and
attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders to (i) give
and receive notices and communications, (ii) to object to claims by an
Indemnified Party for the release of any amount from the Escrow Fund or by
Parent for the release of any amount from the Working Capital Escrow Fund in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Escrow Agreement in
satisfaction of claims against the Escrow Fund under this Article VII by any
Indemnified Party or against the Working Capital Escrow Fund under Section
1.6(h) by Parent, (iii) to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such claims
against the Escrow Fund or Working Capital Escrow Fund, in each case relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) to do or
refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of the Company
Securityholders which the Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
his, her or its sole discretion relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as fully and completely as any of such
Company Securityholder could do if personally present and acting on their own
behalf and (v) to take all other actions that are either necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing or specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative (A) cannot
consent to any term providing direct liability or obligation of a Company
Securityholder and (B) shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Company Securityholders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement. All of the immunities and powers granted to the Representative and
the Advisory Group under this Agreement shall survive the resignation or
removal of Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing
and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The grant
of authority to the Representative provided for in this Agreement (1) is
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Company
Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor, heir or personal
representative thereto and (2) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by
any Company Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its
interest in the Escrow Fund, the Working Capital Fund or the Representative
Fund. The Representative shall be permitted to communicate with the Company
Securityholders, including in electronic form.

(f) Replacement of Representative. The Representative may be changed by the
Company Securityholders upon the written approval of the holders of a majority
in interest of the Pro Rata Portions of the Adjusted Escrow Amount from time
to time and upon prior written notice to the Parent; provided, however, that
the Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest
of the Adjusted Escrow Amount agree in





writing to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative may resign at any time by
providing written notice of intent to resign to the Company Securityholders
and the Parent, which resignation shall be effective upon the earlier of (i)
thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such written notice or (ii)
the appointment of a successor by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Adjusted Escrow Amount. No bond shall be required of the Representative. Any
successor Representative shall be deemed automatically to be the
"Representative" under both this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. If for
any reason there is no Representative at any time, all references herein to
the Representative shall be deemed to refer to the designee of the holders of
a majority in interest of the Pro Rata Portions of the Adjusted Escrow Amount.

(g) Representative Fund. The Representative Escrow Amount shall be wired to
the Representative by Parent upon the Closing of the Merger and shall be held
by the Representative as agent and for the benefit of the Company
Securityholders in a segregated client bank account and shall be used for the
purposes set forth in Section 7.3(a), including paying directly, or
reimbursing the Representative for, any third party expenses (including
counsel, accountants or other experts retained by the Representative) or
Representative Losses incurred pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Representative Agreement. The Representative will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The
interest or other earnings on the Representative Escrow Amount shall be
irrevocably assigned to the Representative. The Company Securityholders
acknowledge that the Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice. The Representative shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Escrow Amount other than as a result of its willful misconduct or bad faith.
For tax purposes, the Representative Escrow Amount shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Securityholders at the
time of Closing. The parties agree that the Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Representative Fund. Each Company Securityholder agrees that Representative
Losses may be deducted by the Representative from the Representative Fund,
subject to the prior approval by the Advisory Group as set forth in the
Representative Agreement.

(h) Limitation of Liability; Indemnification. Certain Company Securityholders
have entered into the Representative Agreement with the Representative to
provide direction to the Representative in connection with the performance of
its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (such Company Securityholders hereinafter referred to as
the "Advisory Group"). To the maximum extent permissible by applicable Legal
Requirements, neither the Representative nor any member of the Advisory Group
shall incur any liability of any kind to any Company Securityholder or any
other Person with respect to any action or inaction taken or failed to be
taken, by it or by its agents, in connection with its services as the
Representative or member of the Advisory Group, except with respect to its own
willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Representative and the Advisory
Group may act in reliance upon any signature believed by it to be genuine and
may reasonably assume that such person has proper authorization to sign on
behalf of the applicable Company Securityholder or other party. In all
questions arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Representative or any member of the
Advisory Group may rely on the advice of counsel, accountants or other skilled
persons, and the Representative will not be liable to any Company
Securityholder or any other Person for anything done, omitted or suffered in
good faith by the Representative based on such advice of counsel, accountants
or other skilled persons, as the case may be. No provision of this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
require the Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Representative shall not be required to
take any action unless the Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Representative in performing such actions. The Representative
and its members, managers, directors, officers, agents and employees shall be
indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Company Securityholders as set
forth in this Section 7.6(d) from and against any and all Losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and disbursements and costs and including costs incurred in connection with
seeking recovery from insurers), judgments, fines or amounts





paid in settlement ("Representative Losses") arising from, based upon or with
respect to the Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
otherwise in connection with acting as the Representative (so long as the
Representative was acting in good faith in connection therewith), in each case
as such Representative Loss is incurred. Any such Representative Losses shall
be recovered first from the Representative Fund, second from any distribution
of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Company Securityholders
pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of
distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Representative to the Escrow Agent, and third directly from the Company
Securityholders, severally and not jointly, in proportion to their Pro Rata
Portion of the Adjusted Representative Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any liability or obligation to indemnify,
defend or hold harmless the Representative.

(i) To the extent the Representative receives documents, spreadsheets or other
forms of information from any party and the Representative is required to
deliver any such document, spreadsheet or other form of information to another
party, the Representative is not responsible for the content of such
materials, nor is the Representative responsible for confirming the accuracy
of any information contained in such materials or reconciling the content of
any such materials with any other documents, spreadsheets or other
information. The Representative shall not be liable to any Company
Securityholder for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Company
Securityholder to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from
other Company Securityholders any payment in excess of the amount to which
they are determined to have been entitled pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, however, that the foregoing recourse limitation shall not apply in
any case where such error was due to fraud or willful misconduct by the
Representative. The Representative shall be entitled to rely upon Schedule
1.6(d) setting forth any apportionment or distribution of payments required to
be made pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

7.7 Third Party Claims.

(i) In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party
claim, excluding, however, any Warranty Claims of the type described in
Section 7.3(a)(iv)(B) (which Warranty Claims will be administered as provided
in Section 7.8) (a "Third Party Claim"), that the Indemnified Party reasonably
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, Parent shall promptly notify the
Representative of such claim. The Representative may, at his or her election,
undertake and conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, but only if and
to the extent that the relief or remedy requested by the claimant in such
Third Party Claim is limited solely to monetary damages and such Third-Party
Claim does not include a claim for any equitable, injunctive, or other non-
monetary relief or remedies. If the Representative elects to undertake the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Representative (i) shall use counsel of
its choice but reasonably acceptable to Parent, (ii) shall be fully
responsible for the outcome thereof, and (iii) shall be solely responsible for
payment of all costs and expenses of its counsel; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative's right to assume and
control the defense of any Third Party Claim is conditioned upon (A) the
Representative acknowledging to the Indemnified Party, in writing and without
qualification or limitation (other than the applicable limitations (if any)
set forth in Sections 7.2 and 7.4), the Indemnified Party's right to recover
all Losses relating to such Third Party Claim from the Escrow Fund and (B) the
amount to fully pay all costs of defending such Third Party Claim, including
the costs and expenses of its counsel, not exceeding the amount then held in
the Representative Fund. Notwithstanding the Representative's election to
undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
nevertheless be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund the amount of all
Losses consisting of costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the response to, or defense of, such Third Party Claim prior
to the assumption of such defense by the Representative to the extent
recoverable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof, but the Representative shall
not be liable to Parent or any other Indemnified Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by Parent or any other Indemnified Party, as applicable,
in connection with the defense thereof, unless such legal expenses are
incurred as a result of the Representative's failure to defend such Third
Party Claim after agreeing to assume the defense thereof.





(j) The Representative shall give notice to Parent as to its intention to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claims within thirty (30) days after the
date of the Representative's receipt of Parent's notice of the existence of
such Third Party Claim. If the Representative elects to undertake the defense
of any Third Party Claim, Parent shall be entitled to participate in, but not
to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Representative does not, within thirty (30) days after the date of its receipt
of Parent's notice of the existence of a Third Party Claim, give notice to the
Parent of its assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Representative shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its right to control
the defense thereof and Parent or the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to control the defense of such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate and shall have the right to recover all Losses relating or
attributable to the defense of such Third Party Claim from the Escrow Fund to
the extent recoverable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof. The party not
controlling the defense of such claim may participate therein at its own
expense.

(k) Neither Representative nor Parent shall have the right to settle or
compromise any such claim except, in the case of a settlement or compromise by
the Representative, with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, in the case of a settlement
or compromise by Parent, with the prior consent of the Representative (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that
with respect to Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages and
that will not result in Parent becoming subject to injunctive or other relief,
if the amount of the Third Party Claim does not exceed the amount then held in
the Escrow Fund (less the aggregate amount of (i) any pending, disputed claims
and (ii) any claims which are undisputed or which have been resolved, but not
yet paid from the Escrow Fund) and such settlement includes a complete release
of the Indemnified Parties from all further liability and no admission of
liability or culpability on the part of the Indemnified Parties, the
Representative may settle or compromise any such claim without the prior
written consent of Parent; provided, further, that no settlement of any such
Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the
amount of Losses relating to such matter; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not alter or affect the right of the Indemnified Party to
recover any amounts actually paid in settlement of such Third Party Claim from
the Escrow Fund to the extent recoverable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof.
The Representative may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim only if it
has agreed to defend such Third Party Claim in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Section 7.7 and, if any proposed settlement or compromise
of any such Third Party Claim includes as an element thereof any non-monetary
remedy or relief or any other non-monetary obligation that will be binding on
the Company or any other Indemnified Party, the Representative shall not
accept or otherwise effect such settlement or compromise, and such settlement
or compromise shall not be effective or binding upon the Company or any other
Indemnified Party, without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
may withheld or granted by Parent in its sole discretion, for any reason or no
reason.

7.8 Warranty Claims. The Surviving Corporation and its designated
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and subcontractors shall have the exclusive right and
authority to respond to, administer and settle all Warranty Claims of the type
described in Section 7.3(a)(iv)(B) and to provide the products and services
necessary to perform or otherwise discharge the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries with respect to such Warranty Claims and,
accordingly, in no event will any such Warranty Claim be deemed to constitute
a Third Party Claim for purposes of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating party or parties, whether before or after the requisite approvals
of the stockholders of the Company, as follows:

(k) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of Directors of
Parent and the Company;





(l) by either the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated before October 9, 2013 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however,
that if 100% of the Company Stockholders have not approved the Merger in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL on or before the Outside
Date, then the Outside Date shall be extended to the date that is twenty one
(21) days following the mailing of the notice of appraisal or dissenters
rights to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL;
provided, further, that if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Outside
Date, but on such date, all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VI other than (i) conditions that by their nature are only to be satisfied as
of the Closing and (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) (but solely
to the extent the matter giving rise to the failure of such condition is
related to the HSR Act or equivalent foreign antitrust Legal Requirements, if
any) or Section 6.1(c), have been satisfied or waived in writing, then the
Outside Date shall be extended by one (1) month; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such
date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

(m) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action (including the failure to have taken an action), in any case, having
the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final and
nonappealable;

(n) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if such
inaccuracy in Parent's representations and warranties or breach by Parent is
curable by Parent prior to the Outside Date through the exercise of
commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) prior to thirty (30) days following the
receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
breach by Parent is cured so that such conditions would then be satisfied); or

(o) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if such
inaccuracy in the Company's representations and warranties or breach by the
Company is curable by the Company prior to the Outside Date through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) prior to the thirty (30) days
following the receipt of written notice from Parent to the Company of such
breach (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if it shall have materially breached this
Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured so that such conditions
would then be satisfied).

8.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.1 will be effective (subject to the cure periods
provided above) immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the
terminating party to the other party hereto. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be void and
of no further force or effect and neither party shall have any liability
hereunder, except (a) as set forth in Section 5.3(a), this Section 8.2,
Section 8.3 and Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability
for breach of any covenant set forth in Article IV or Article V of this
Agreement or fraud or any willful and knowing breach of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Company shall have no liability for any
corrections, supplements or unknown omissions made pursuant to Section 4.2
upon termination of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms.





8.3 Amendment. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after obtaining the
Required Stockholder Approval, provided that after obtaining the Required
Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made which requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Representative.

8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein; provided, however, that any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure

subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, including the Prior Agreement, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the

reason of this Agreement other than (a) as specifically provided in Section
5.7 and Section 5.8; (b) the rights of Company Securityholders and the Other

their sole and absolute discretion. Subject in all respects to Section 7.3(e),
each of the Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has made its
own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its businesses and
operations, and Parent and Merger Sub have been furnished with or given full
access to such information about the Company and its businesses and operations
as they requested. Subject in all respects to Section 7.3(e), Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets;
(ii) Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with such uncertainties; and (iii)
Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluations of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them or their representatives.
Subject in all respects to Section 7.3(e), Parent and Merger Sub each
acknowledge that, except as expressly set forth in Article II, there are no
representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, by the Company
or any other Person, including (A) with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their assets and liabilities, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (B) as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company furnished or made available to Parent,
Merger





Sub and their representatives (including any projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans or budgets). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no
express or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose with respect to any of the Company's tangible personal property.

9.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy; provided, however, the
parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that the remedy of specific
performance or any similar equitable remedies shall not be available to the
Company or the Representative for the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
complete the Merger for any reason.

9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

9.9 Consent to Jurisdiction.

(d) Each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts of Delaware, New
Castle County and to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, for the purpose of any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and each of Parent,
the Company and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively
in any of such courts. Each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub agrees that
a final judgment in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

(e) Each of Parent, the Company and Merger Sub irrevocably consents to the
service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other action
or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on
behalf of itself or its property, by the personal delivery of copies of such
process to such party. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY, THE
COMPANY SECURITYHOLDERS, THE REPRESENTATIVE AND THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY,
OR THE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.11 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law,





regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

9.12 Assignment. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties, except that following the Closing, Parent shall have the
right, upon notice to the Representative, to (a) assign and delegate all of
its rights, duties and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent,
provided that Parent nevertheless remains secondarily liable to the
Representative for any failure of such Affiliate to perform any of Parent's
obligations hereunder and (b) pledge and assign any or all of Parent's rights
hereunder to the bank or financial institution providing financing to Parent
as collateral security for Parent's obligations to such bank or financial
institution. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 9.12 shall
be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

9.13 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

9.14 No Personal Liability. Except as set forth herein, this Agreement will
not create or be deemed to create or permit any personal liability or
obligation on the part of any direct or indirect stockholder of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub or any officer, director, employee, agent, representative
or investor of any party.

9.15 Guarantee. EnerSys, a Delaware corporation and the ultimate parent
corporation of Parent ("Guarantor"), by its execution and delivery of the
Limited Joinder appended to this Agreement, hereby unconditionally,
absolutely, continuing and irrevocably guarantees, as surety, the full and
complete payment and performance of all obligations and liabilities, whether
now in existence or hereafter arising, of Parent, Merger Sub and, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation under (a) this Agreement (but
only to the extent that any such obligations of the Surviving Corporation are
required by this Agreement to be paid or performed by the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time and not by the Company prior to the
Effective Time) and (b) the Escrow Agreement (the "Guarantor Undertakings").
The obligations of Guarantor with respect to the Guarantor Undertakings shall
not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any
reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration,
compromise, modification or amendment. Notice of acceptance of this guarantee
and of the incurring of any obligation or default of the Guarantor
Undertakings, as well as demand and protest with respect to such Guarantor
Undertakings, are hereby waived by Guarantor.

9.16 Effectiveness of Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement amends and
restates certain provisions of the Prior Agreement and restates the terms of
the Prior Agreement in their entirety. All amendments to the Prior Agreement
effected by this Agreement, and all other covenants, agreements, terms and
provisions of this Agreement, shall have effect as of the date of the Prior
Agreement unless expressly stated otherwise, and accordingly, the phrases "as
of the date hereof," "as of the date of this Agreement," or any similar terms
as used in this Agreement will be deemed to refer to the date of the Prior
Agreement. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date that copies hereof
have been executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto.
