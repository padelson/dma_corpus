(iii)   _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. On or before the
120th day following the Closing Date, the Buyer, at Buyer's sole cost and
expense shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative a final
balance sheet of each of the Company Sellers as of the Effective Time (each,
a " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " and collectively, the " _Final
Closing Date Balance Sheets_ "), which shall include the final determination
of the Net Working Capital of the Company Sellers as of the Effective Time
(the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "). The Final Closing Date
Balance Sheets shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the preparation
of the Closing Date Balance Sheets; provided, however, that any accounts
receivable reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheets will be disregarded
for purposes of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets to the extent such
accounts receivable remain uncollected 120 days following the Closing. During
the 30-day period immediately following the Sellers' Representative's receipt
of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheets, the Sellers' Representative, at its
sole cost and expense, shall be permitted to review the Buyer's
working papers related to the preparation and determination of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheets.

  

(iv)  The Final Closing Date Balance Sheets shall become final and
binding upon the Parties thirty (30) days following the
Sellers' Representative's receipt thereof, unless the Sellers' Representative
gives written notice of disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the
Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so
asserted. If the Buyer receives a Notice of Disagreement within
the appropriate time frame, each undisputed item on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheets shall become final and binding and each disputed item on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheets shall become final and binding on the
earliest of (x) the date the Parties resolve in writing each such difference
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
or (y) the date on which each such matter in dispute is finally resolved
jointly by the independent public accounting firm selected by the Sellers'
Representative and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Parent's independent
public accountant. During the twenty (20) days following delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement, if the Parties have not resolved such differences outlined
in the Notice of Disagreement, the Parties, unless otherwise mutually agreed
to in writing, shall submit to their respective independent public
accountants for review and resolution only such matters that remain in dispute
and that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Parties
shall instruct their respective independent public accountants to resolve such
disputed matters within thirty (30) days of submission and to not assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such
item assigned by either Party or lesser than the smallest value of such item
assigned by either Party. Each Party shall pay the fees and expenses of its
respective independent public accountant.

(v)  Upon the final determination of the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital as set forth in _Section 1.5(c)(iv)_ , if the aggregate Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected in the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheets exceeds the aggregate Closing Date Net Working Capital as
reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheets, then the Purchase Price shall
be increased in total by an amount equal to the absolute value of the
difference between the aggregate Final Closing Date Net Working Capital and
the aggregate Closing Date Net Working Capital (such difference, the " _Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "), with such increase to the
Purchase Price being allocated solely to the Estimated Cash Purchase Price.
Any additional Purchase Price payable in regards to the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price shall be paid to the Company Sellers within thirty (30) days
of such amount becoming final pursuant to this _Section 1.5(c)(iv)_. Upon the
final determination of the aggregate Final Closing Date Net Working Capital,
if the aggregate Final Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected in the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheets is less than the aggregate Closing Date Net
Working Capital as reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheets, then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced in total by an amount equal to the Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, with such reduction to the
Purchase Price being allocated solely to the Estimated Cash Purchase Price.
Any reduction in the Estimated Cash Purchase Price as a result of the
adjustment contemplated by _Section 1.5(c)(iv)_ shall be deducted from the
Asset Purchase Escrow Amount (as defined in _Section 1.6_ of this Agreement),
and, if the Asset Purchase Escrow Amount is exhausted, the Company Sellers
and the Shareholders, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Buyer any
portion of the Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount applicable to
the Estimated Cash Purchase Price not paid from the Escrow Amount within
thirty (30) days of demand by the Buyer.

  

(vi)  Any payments made under this _Section 1.5(c)_ shall be
treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be allocated to the Company Sellers based on the
percentages set forth on _Schedule 1.5(b)_.

  

(d)   _Adjusted EBITDA Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase
Price shall be adjusted by an amount equal to the difference between the
Final 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount and the Targeted Adjusted EBITDA Amount (the
" _Adjusted EBITDA Adjustment_ "), as follows:

  

(i)   _Closing Date Adjusted EBITDA Purchase Price
Adjustment_. On or before (but in no event earlier than ten (10) Business
Days prior to) the Closing Date, the Sellers' Representative shall deliver to
the Buyer a statement (the " _Closing Date Adjusted EBITDA Statement_ "),
which sets forth the estimated aggregate Adjusted EBITDA Amount of the Company
Sellers and Del Monte for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014 (the "
_Estimated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount_ "). The Closing Date Adjusted EBITDA
Statement shall be derived from the income statements of each of the Company
Sellers and Del Monte prepared in connection with the preparation of the
Audited Financial Statements (as defined in _Section 2.4_ of this
Agreement) and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, sound business
practices and, to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP, in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements,
and shall be calculated in a manner substantially consistent with and
substantially in the form of _Schedule 1.5(d)(i)_. If the Estimated 2014
Adjusted EBITDA Amount is less than the Targeted Adjusted EBITDA Amount, then
the Purchase Price shall be decreased in total by an amount equal to the
product of (A) the absolute value of the difference between the Targeted
Adjusted EBITDA Amount and the Estimated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA
Amount multiplied by (B) the Purchase Price Multiple. If the Estimated 2014
Adjusted EBITDA Amount is greater than the Targeted Adjusted EBITDA Amount,
then the Purchase Price shall be increased in total by an amount equal to the
product of (i) the absolute value of the difference between the Targeted
Adjusted EBITDA Amount and the Estimated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount
multiplied by (ii) the Additional Earn-Out Multiple, and such increase, if
any, will be allocated to the Additional Earn-Out Amount. Any decrease to the
Purchase Price on account of the adjustment contemplated by this _Section
1.5(d)(i)_  shall be allocated to the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, the
Primary Earn-Out Amount and the Subordinated Convertible Seller Note Amount
in the Percentages set forth on _Schedule 1.5(d)(i)_.

(ii)   _Post-Closing Adjusted EBITDA Purchase Price Adjustment_.
On or before the 120th day following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Sellers' Representative a statement (the " _Final
Adjusted EBITDA Statement_ ") setting forth the final determination of the
aggregate Adjusted EBITDA Amount of the Company Sellers and Del Monte for the
fiscal year ended December 27, 2014 (the " _Final 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount_
"). The Final Adjusted EBITDA Statement shall be derived from the income
statements of each of the Company Sellers and Del Monte prepared in connection
with the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements and shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, sound business practices and, to the extent
not inconsistent with GAAP, in a manner consistent with the preparation of the
Audited Financial Statements and shall be calculated in a manner consistent
with _Schedule 1.5(d)(i)_. During the 30-day period immediately following
the Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Final Adjusted EBITDA Statement,
the Sellers' Representative shall be permitted to review the Buyer's working
papers related to the preparation and determination of the Final 2014
Adjusted EBITDA Amount. The Final Adjusted EBITDA Statement shall become
final and binding upon the Parties thirty (30) days following the Sellers'
Representative's receipt thereof, unless the Sellers' Representative gives
written notice of disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA_ ") to
the Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement
so asserted. If the Buyer receives a Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA within
the appropriate time frame, each undisputed item on the Final Adjusted EBITDA
Statement shall become final and binding and each disputed item on the Final
Adjusted EBITDA Statement shall become final and binding on the earliest of
(x) the date the Parties resolve in writing each such difference they have
with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA
or (y) the date on which each such matter in dispute is finally resolved
jointly by the Sellers' independent public accountant selected pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)_ and Parent's independent public accountant. During the
twenty (20) days following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA, if
the Parties have not resolved such differences outlined in the Notice of
Disagreement - EBITDA, the Parties, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in
writing, shall submit to their respective independent public accountants for
review and resolution only such matters that remain in dispute and that were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement - EBITDA. The Parties shall
instruct their respective independent public accountants to resolve such
disputed matters within thirty (30) days of submission and to not assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by either Party or lesser than the smallest value of such
item assigned by either Party. Each Party shall pay the fees and expenses of
its respective independent public accountants.

  

(iii)  Upon the final determination of the Final 2014 Adjusted
EBITDA Amount as set forth in this _Section 1.5(d)_ , if the Final 2014
Adjusted EBITDA Amount exceeds the Estimated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount as
reflected in the Closing Date Adjusted EBITDA Statement, then the Additional
Earn-Out Amount shall be increased in total by an amount equal to the product
of (i) the absolute value of the difference between the Final 2014 Adjusted
EBITDA Amount and the Estimated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount (the "
_Final Adjusted EBITDA Difference_ ") multiplied by (ii) the Additional Earn-
Out Multiple. Upon the final determination of the Final 2014 Adjusted EBITDA
Amount, if the Final 2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount is less than the Estimated
2014 Adjusted EBITDA Amount as reflected in the Closing Date Adjusted EBITDA
Statement, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced in total by an amount
equal to the product of (i) the Final Adjusted EBITDA Difference and (ii) the
Purchase Price Multiple, with such reduction to the Purchase Price being
allocated to the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, the Primary Earn-Out Amount
and the Subordinated Convertible Seller Note Amount in the percentages set
forth on _Schedule 1.5(d)(iii)_.

(iv)  Any reduction in the Estimated Cash Purchase Price shall, at
the Buyer's sole election, either be deducted from the Asset Purchase Escrow
Amount, or such amount not deducted from the Asset Purchase Escrow Amount, if
any, shall be paid jointly and severally by the Company Sellers and the
Shareholders within thirty (30) days of demand by the Buyer. In the event that
the adjustment resulting from this _Section 1.5(d)_ results in a decrease in
the Primary Earn-Out Amount and the Subordinated Convertible Seller
Note Amount, such adjustments shall be reflected in an amendment to the
Primary Earn-Out Agreement and the Subordinated Convertible Seller Note that
in each case is entered into within thirty (30) days of such amounts becoming
final pursuant to this _Section 1.5(d)_.

  

(v)  Any payments made under this _Section 1.5(d)_ shall be
treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

  

1.6   _Escrow Agreement_. At Closing, the Company Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative, the Buyer, the Merger Sub, Chef's Warehouse and the
Escrow Agent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which provides for the payment
by the Buyer or the Merger Sub, as of the Closing Date, to the escrow
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") of (i) the aggregate sum of Five Million

of Del Monte pursuant to the Merger Agreement which is required to be placed
into escrow at the closing of the transaction contemplated thereby (the "
_Stock Escrow Amount_ ", the Asset Purchase Escrow Amount and the Stock

ARTICLE II. 
  Representations and Warranties of the Sellers

  

Each Seller, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to the Buyer and

Power_.

under the Laws of the State of California. Each Company Seller is duly
qualified or otherwise authorized to act as a foreign corporation or limited
liability company, as applicable, and is in good standing under the Laws of
every other jurisdiction in which such qualification or authorization is
necessary. Each jurisdiction in which each Company Seller is qualified to do
business is set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_. True, complete and accurate
copies of the organizational documents of each Company Seller have been
delivered to the Buyer. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.1(a)_ , neither of
the Company Sellers has any subsidiaries or owns any equity interests, or
rights to acquire any equity interests, in any other entity.

  

(b)  Each Company Seller possesses all requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, necessary to

contemplated hereby, including, without limitation those contemplated by
_Section 1.7(b)_ of this Agreement (the " _Transaction Documents_ ") (to which
such Company Seller is, or will be, a party), and to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents (to
which such Company Seller is, or will be, a party). Each Company Seller

number and class of equity interests of each Company Seller authorized, issued
and outstanding and the number and class of equity interests of each Company

Shareholder will own the equity interests in the Company Sellers owned
thereby as of the date hereof. The equity interests of each Company
Seller have not been issued in violation of, and are not subject to, any
preemptive or subscription rights or rights of first refusal. Neither Company
Seller has violated the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or other
applicable Laws in connection with the offer, sale or issuance of its equity

otherwise) in, any other Person.

equity interest of any other Person.

performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by such Seller. This

limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity (the "

Seller is a party, each of such Transaction Documents will constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sellers that are a party thereto,
enforceable against such Sellers in accordance with their respective terms
except for Creditors' Rights and Equitable Limitations.

applicable requirements under the HSR Act, the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to

Closing (the " _Excluded Employees_ "). Other than the Excluded Employees, on
or before the Closing, the Buyer or an Affiliate thereof shall offer to hire
or retain as of the Effective Time all Company Employees (the " _Eligible
Employees_ "). Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right

between an employee and the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the employment or
retention of each Eligible Employee who is employed or retained by the Buyer

(b)  Up to and following the Closing, each Company Seller shall
continue the health insurance Employee Benefit Plan currently in effect with
respect to the Business if and as required by Law (or adopt a successor plan),
and assume all responsibility for the provision of health continuation
coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("
_COBRA_ "), as amended, to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations §54.4980B-9, QandA-4) that experience a
qualifying event under COBRA prior to or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) all
Company Employees not hired by the Buyer or its Affiliates at the Closing and
their beneficiaries, and (ii) all other current and former employees of the
Company Sellers and their respective Affiliates (not including any
Hired Employees employed by the Buyer or its Affiliates as of the Effective
Time), and their beneficiaries. Each Company Seller's obligation to continue
the health insurance Employee Benefit Plan currently in effect pursuant to
this _Section 4.6_ shall continue following the Closing until such time as
prescribed by Law. The Buyer shall not have any responsibility, liability
or obligation, whether to employees not hired by it or its Affiliates at the
Closing and their beneficiaries, or to other current and former employees of
any Company Seller or their Affiliates (not including any Hired Employees
employed by the Buyer as of the Effective Time) with respect to any
notification or provision of health continuation coverage in accordance with
the requirements of COBRA.

  

(c)  Each Company Seller shall cease contributions to, and
adopt all corporate or limited liability company resolutions, as
applicable, required to terminate their respective Employee Benefit Plans,
and vest all participants under any applicable 401(k) Plan, in each case as
prescribed by Law, immediately prior to Closing.

  

(d)   No Seller, nor any Affiliate thereof, shall enter into any
agreement or arrangement (whether written, oral or otherwise) with any Person
whether denominated as a payment, security, gift, or otherwise, pursuant to
which such Person would be entitled to receive any portion of the Purchase
Price or Merger Consideration (including, without limitation, the Earn-Out
Amount or the Additional Earn-Out Amount), whether denominated in cash or
equity securities, if the effect of such agreement or arrangement would be
that Buyer or Parent, or any Subsidiary of Parent other than Buyer, would be
required to recognize expense for financial reporting purposes (including,
without limitation, compensation expense) following the Closing on account
thereof.

4.7   _Non-Competition_.

  

(a) _Material Inducement_. Each Company Seller and Shareholder
hereby acknowledges that such Company Seller or Shareholder is familiar with
the Combined Companies' Business's Trade Secrets and with other Confidential
Information and Trade Secrets pertaining to the Acquired Assets and the
assets of Del Monte and the Business and Del Monte's Business. Each
Company Seller and Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the Buyer and
Parent and their Affiliates would be irreparably damaged if any of the
Company Sellers or Shareholders or any of their Affiliates were to provide
services to or otherwise participate in the business of any Person competing
or planning to compete with the Buyer or its Affiliates in a business similar
to the Combined Companies' Business and that any such competition by any of
the Company Sellers or Shareholders or any of their Affiliates would result
in a significant loss of goodwill by the Business. The Company Sellers and the
Shareholders further acknowledge and agree that the covenants and agreements
set forth in this _Section 4.7_ were a material inducement to the Buyer and
Parent to enter into this Agreement and to perform their obligations hereunder
and that neither the Buyer nor its Affiliates would obtain the benefit of the
bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties
if any of the Company Sellers or Shareholders or their Affiliates breached the
provisions of this _Section 4.7_.

  

(b)   _Restrictive Covenants_. In further consideration of the
amounts to be paid hereunder for the Business, each Company Seller and each
of the Shareholders covenants and agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which
consent may be withheld in the Buyer's sole discretion), engage, directly or
indirectly, including through direct or indirect equity ownership, in any
business competing or planning to compete with the Combined
Companies' Business, including, but not limited to, soliciting or serving any
customers of the Combined Companies' Business, for a period of five (5) years
following the Closing in all States of the United States of America and all
foreign jurisdictions where the Combined Companies' Business has operations
or does business. In addition, each Company Seller and each
Shareholder agrees that until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, it
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) directly, or indirectly
through another Person, solicit, hire or attempt to hire any Hired Employee,
any employee of Del Monte's as of the date hereof or the Closing Date or
other employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates without the Buyer's prior
written consent, which consent may be withheld in the Buyer's sole
discretion.

  

(c)   _Remedies_. If, at the time of enforcement of any of the
covenants contained in _Section 4.7(b)_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), a
court shall hold that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein
are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that
the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall
be substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court
shall be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to
cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by applicable Laws. Each
Company Seller and Shareholder has determined and hereby acknowledges that
the Restrictive Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area
restrictions and are necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and
the substantial investment in the Acquired Assets and the Business made by the
Buyer hereunder. Each Company Seller and Shareholder further acknowledges and
agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are being entered into by them in
connection with the sale of the Business and the goodwill of the Business.

If any of the Company Sellers or the Shareholders, or any of their
Affiliates, breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of
the Restrictive Covenants, the Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates
shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which rights and
remedies shall be independent of the others and severally enforceable, and
each of which is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to the Buyer, or any of its Affiliates, at law or in
equity:

  

(i)  the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants
specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed
that any breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable injury to the Buyer and that monetary damages would not provide
an adequate remedy to the Buyer; and

  

(ii)  the right and remedy to require the Company Sellers or the
Shareholders to account for and pay over to the Buyer or its Affiliates any
profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by
such Person as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the
Restrictive Covenants from the date any Company Seller or Shareholder or any
Company Seller's Affiliate was in breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants.

  

(d)  In the event of any breach or violation by any Company
Seller or Shareholder or any Company Seller's Affiliate of any of the
Restrictive Covenants, the time period of such covenant shall be tolled until
such breach or violation is resolved.

  

(e)  The parties recognize the possibility that a Shareholder
may execute in the future or may have executed in the past other
agreements with Parent, Buyer, any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates, including, but not limited to, the Merger Agreement and the
Transaction Documents contemplated in the Purchase Agreement including any
employment agreement or offer letter (the " _Additional Agreements_ "), which
contain restrictive covenants similar to the ones contained in this Section
4.7. It is intended that Parent, Buyer, their Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates at all times be afforded the broadest benefit and protection
possible under this Agreement and any Additional Agreements, and, to the
extent possible and permissible under applicable law, any similar restrictive
covenants contained in this Agreement and any Additional Agreement shall be
read together and their terms combined in the manner most restrictive to a
Shareholder and most protective to Parent, Buyer, their Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates. To the extent that any restrictive covenants contained in any
Additional Agreement differ from, conflict with or are inconsistent with any
restrictive covenants contained in any other Additional Agreement or contained
in this Agreement, the restrictive covenants most restrictive to a
Shareholder and most protective to Parent, Buyer, their Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates shall control, without regard to the relative timing of their
execution, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law.

  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.7_ or this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents to the contrary, the provisions of
this _Section 4.7_ , including but not limited to, the prohibitions,
restrictions and limitations on Sellers (and/or its/their Affiliates or
family members), shall _not_ prohibit the ownership by such Persons of the OWP
Interest held or to be held by Sellers (and/or its/their Affiliates or family
members), and shall _not_ apply to the OWP Business as it is conducted on the
date hereof, _nor_ any of Sellers' (and/or its/their Affiliates' or family
members') involvement in the OWP Business as it is conducted on the date
hereof, which OWP Interests and OWP Business Sellers (and/or its/their
Affiliates or family members) may, subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Section 4.7(f)_ , hold and conduct in Sellers' (and/or its/their
Affiliates' or family members') sole and absolute discretion.

--- 

    

 _Schedule 4.7(f)_ attached hereto contains a description (including a
description of the mix of business between retail and wholesale) of the OWP
Business as it is conducted on the date hereof, and each of the Sellers, Buyer
and Parent acknowledge and agree that the description of the OWP Business
included on _Schedule 4.7(f)_ represents a business that is not in violation
of the Restrictive Covenants and is non-competitive with the Business. Should
the OWP Business as conducted on the date hereof materially change at any
time post-Closing, then the Sellers' Representative shall promptly notify the
Buyer and Parent in writing of such change and if Parent and Buyer reasonably
conclude that as so changed the OWP Business is competitive with the Combined
Companies' Business or any Sellers' (and/or its/their Affiliates' or family
members') involvement in the OWP Business or continued ownership of the OWP
Interests violates the Restrictive Covenants, then any such Seller, Affiliate
or family member shall promptly resign from the Board of Directors or other
organizational body and as an employee of OWP or any successor thereof, and
shall divest its/their OWP Interests on or before twelve (12) months from the
date of such material change in the OWP Business.

Sellers and the Shareholders shall execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer as the Buyer or Parent may
reasonably request and provide and shall take such additional action as the
Buyer or Parent may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or
evidence the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
transfer to the Buyer of the Acquired Assets, and each of the Company Sellers
and the Shareholders shall execute such reasonable documentation provided by
the Buyer or Parent as may be reasonably necessary to assist the Buyer or

4.13   _Consents_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assumed
Contract, claim or other right of the Company Sellers if the assignment or

asserted on or prior to the Effective Time, other than the
Assumed Liabilities. If any Excluded Liabilities or Pre-Closing Liabilities
are not so paid or provided for, or if the Buyer reasonably determines that
failure to make any payments will impair Buyer's use or enjoyment of the
Acquired Assets or conduct of the Business, the Buyer may at any time after
the Closing Date, upon prior written notice to the Company Sellers (provided
that the failure to notify the Company Sellers shall not relieve the Company
Sellers from their obligations under this _Section 4.14_ ), elect to make all
such payments directly (but shall have no obligation to do so) and seek
reimbursement from the Sellers for such payments to the extent that Buyer is

8.16   _Sellers ' Representative_.

  

(a)  John DeBenedetti, as the Sellers' Representative, shall be
constituted and appointed as agent for and on behalf of each Company Seller
and Shareholder to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to,
negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the Company Sellers and Shareholders,
amendments, consents and waivers under this Agreement pursuant to the terms
set forth herein, to make and receive payments on behalf of the Company
Sellers and Shareholders pursuant to the terms set forth herein, to take such
other actions as authorized by this Agreement, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers' Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. If at any time the Sellers'
Representative resigns, dies or becomes incapable of acting, the Company
Sellers and Shareholders shall choose another person to act as the
Sellers' Representative under this Agreement. The Selling Party Indemnitees
may not make a claim for indemnity against either Buyer or Parent pursuant to
this Agreement except through the Sellers' Representative. Once the Sellers'
Representative has initiated such a claim for indemnity, the Sellers'
Representative may enforce, prosecute and settle such claim without
further directions from the Selling Party Indemnitees, and all acts and
decisions of the Sellers' Representative in connection with such matter shall
be binding on all the Selling Party Indemnitees. No bond shall be required of
the Sellers' Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall receive no
compensation for services provided hereunder. Notices or communications to or
from the Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice to or from each
Company Seller and Shareholder.

  

(b)  The Sellers' Representative will be entitled to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents as the Sellers' Representative deems
necessary or proper in connection with performing the Sellers'
Representative's obligations hereunder, and will be promptly reimbursed by
the Company Sellers and Shareholders for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred by the Sellers' Representative in such
capacity upon demand. Each Company Seller and Shareholder shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers' Representative pro rata based upon such Company
Seller's and Shareholder's pro rata share of the equity interests in the
Company Sellers as of the Closing Date, from any and all Losses that are
incurred by the Sellers' Representative as a result of actions taken, or
actions not taken, by the Sellers' Representative herein, except to
the extent that such Losses arise from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Sellers' Representative. The Sellers' Representative shall
not be liable to the Company Sellers and Shareholders for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers' Representative, excluding acts which
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  

(c)  A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers'
Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement shall constitute
a decision of all of the Company Sellers and Shareholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Company Seller and Shareholder and the
Buyer and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Sellers' Representative hereunder as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of each and every such Company Seller and Shareholder. Each of
the Buyer and Parent is hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person
(including any Company Seller and Shareholder) for any acts done by the Buyer
or Parent in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers' Representative.
