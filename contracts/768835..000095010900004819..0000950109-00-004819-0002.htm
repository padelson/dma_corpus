the Company and the Subsidiaries to prepare and provide to Seller one or more packages of information materials as are reasonably necessary for the purpose of preparing each such Income Tax Return (the &quot;Tax Packages&quot;). Each Tax Package shall be
completed in all material respects in accordance with the standards that Seller has established for its other subsidiaries. If Buyer reasonably believes that such standards differ materially from Seller's past practices for the Company and the

Seller's past practices, Buyer and Seller will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve such dispute within 10 days, such dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee in accordance with Section 13.07. If

such Indemnifying Party's expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party (i) delivers written notice to the Indemnified Party within ten days of receipt of notice of such

conduct such defense in a commercially reasonable manner through judgment or settlement in accordance with this Section 11.03, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in such defense to the extent the Indemnified Party is not prejudiced
thereby. So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of such Action as provided in the previous sentence, the Indemnified Party may participate in the defense of such Action by retaining separate counsel at its sole cost and expense, and

any settlement with respect to, such Action in any manner it may reasonably deem to be appropriate; <U>provided</U>, that the Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgement or enter into any settlement with respect to such Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably

party any proposed entry of judgment or settlement to which the other party does not consent within ten business days, the non-consenting party shall, and hereby agrees to, indemnify the proposing party against all Losses relating to such Action to the
extent in excess of the amount of such Losses based upon the proposed settlement. The indemnification provided by the immediately preceding sentence shall be in addition to that provided by the other provisions of this Article XI, shall be from the first
dollar and shall not be subject to the limitations on Losses set forth in Sections 11.02(a) or (b) or Section 11.04(b).</FONT></P>

Accounting Referee&quot; under this Agreement. The Arbitration shall be conducted under the auspices of the Accounting Referee and, except to the extent said rules conflict with the terms of this Section 13.07, shall be conducted in accordance with the

parties are unable after good faith negotiation to agree upon and select one of the individuals so identified to act as the Arbitrator, then each party shall have the right to deliver to the Accounting Referee a confidential communication striking no more
than one of the individuals previously identified as a potential Arbitrator. The Accounting Referee shall then proceed to select the Arbitrator from among the previously identified individuals who have not been stricken from consideration. Upon being
selected, the Arbitrator shall conduct the Arbitration in question; shall determine the matter at issue in the Arbitration and shall set forth such determination in a written ruling, which ruling shall be rendered within 30 days of the date on which the
Arbitrator was selected and shall be delivered to the parties in accordance with the terms of Section 13.01 of this Agreement. The ruling of the Arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties; shall have the legal effect of an arbitral
award and shall be subject only to the judicial review permitted by the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the ruling of the Arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their assets. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be allocated between the parties in the same proportion that the aggregate amount submitted to the Accounting Referee that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Accounting
Referee) bears to the total amount so submitted.</FONT></P>
