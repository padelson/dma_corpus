and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company
nor its Affiliates does now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies

or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity&nbsp;or any other theory of legal
liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the &#8220;<B><I>Released Claims</I></B>&#8221;).

agreement with OAC or its Affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement
and specifically relied upon by the OAC and its Affiliates to induce OAC to enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends
and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent the Company or any of its
Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating
