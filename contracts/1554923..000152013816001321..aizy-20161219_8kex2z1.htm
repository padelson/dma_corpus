share capital, warrants and rights of OAC immediately prior to the Effective
Time (as defined herein), shall no longer be outstanding and shall

233 of the Cayman Act (the time of

    

1

 



    

such filing, or such later time as specified in the Certificate of Merger and
Plan of Merger, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

1.3   _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger,
the Plan of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Cayman
Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, agreements,
powers and franchises, debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of OAC and
Merger Sub shall become the property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers
and franchises, debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, which shall include the assumption by the Surviving Corporation
of any and all agreements, covenants, duties and obligations of OAC and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Effective
Time.

  

1.4   _Surviving Corporation Organizational Documents_. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation.

  

1.5   _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the board of directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the board of directors and officers of the Company at the
Effective Time (after giving effect to Section 5.13).

  

1.6   _Merger Consideration_. As consideration for the Merger,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each holder of OAC
Securities shall be entitled to receive from the Company in exchange for:

  

(a)  each OAC Ordinary Share (including any OAC Rights that are
converted into Ordinary Shares in accordance with the OAC Organizational
Documents, the IPO Prospectus and Section 1.7(e) below), 0.600 shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ");

  

(b)  each OAC Warrant, a Replacement Company Warrant;

  

(c)  the OAC UPO, the Replacement Company UPO;

  

(d)  the OAC Fortress Convertible Notes, the consideration
described in Section 1.7(h) below; and

  

(e)  the OAC Management Convertible Note, if converted by the
holders thereof upon the consummation of the Closing in accordance with the
terms thereof, the consideration described in Section 1.7(i) below.

  

1.7   _Effect of Merger on OAC Securities_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party or
the holders of any OAC Securities or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

(a)   _OAC Ordinary Share_. Subject to clauses (b) and (c)
below, each OAC Ordinary Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes
to represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest. As of the Effective Time, each holder of OAC Ordinary Shares shall
cease to have any other rights with respect to OAC Ordinary Shares other than
for such holders who have redeemed their OAC Ordinary Shares in accordance
with the OAC Organizational Documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the right to receive redemption funds from the Trust Account
in accordance with the such Organizational Documents. Any OAC Ordinary Shares
that are held in escrow or subject to lock-up

    

2

 



    

shall have the Per Share Merger Consideration issued in exchange therefore
continue to be so held in escrow or subject to lock-up. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no fractional shares of Company
Common Stock will be issued and instead the applicable Merger consideration
will be rounded in the aggregate for each holder to the nearest whole number.

  

(b)   _Treasury Shares_. Notwithstanding clause (a) above or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time,
if there are any OAC Securities that are owned by OAC as treasury shares or
any OAC Securities owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of OAC
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such OAC Securities shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

  

(c)   _Dissenting Shares_. Each of the Dissenting Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and cease to exist in accordance with Section 1.10 and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in
Section 1.10.

  

(d)   _OAC Warrants_. Each outstanding OAC Warrant shall be
cancelled, retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire
OAC Ordinary Shares and automatically converted into the right to receive from
the Company a new warrant for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of the applicable OAC Warrant (each, a " _Replacement Company
Warrant_ "). The Company shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long as any
of the Replacement Company Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of such
Replacement Company Warrants.

  

(e)   _OAC Rights_. In accordance with the OAC Organizational
Documents and the IPO Prospectus, effective as of the Effective Time, each
OAC Right shall convert into one-tenth (1/10th) of an OAC Ordinary Share,
with the total number of OAC Ordinary Shares to be received by each holder of
OAC Rights rounded to the nearest whole share, and with the holder of each
such converted OAC Ordinary Share entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(a). Each OAC Right issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and
automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration for each OAC Ordinary Share represented by
such OAC Right (as rounded in accordance with this Section 1.7(e)), without
interest.

  

(f)   _OAC Units_. Any OAC Unit that has not previously been
separated into OAC Ordinary Shares, OAC Rights and OAC Warrants in accordance
with its terms will automatically be so separated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with the holder thereof being entitled to receive the Merger
consideration for each OAC Security represented thereby.

  

(g)   _OAC UPO_. The OAC UPO will be cancelled, retired and
terminated and automatically converted into the right to receive from the
Company a new unit purchase option (the " _Replacement Company UPO_ "). The
Replacement Company UPO shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions set forth in the OAC UPO, except that instead of 400,000
OAC Public Units, it will be exercisable for 400,000 units of Company
securities at a price per Company unit equal to (x) $11.00 divided by (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, with each Company unit entitled to receive a
number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to 1.1 multiplied by the Per
Share Merger Consideration (rounded in the aggregate for each holder to the
nearest whole share) and a Replacement Company Warrant (in lieu of an OAC
Public Warrant), in each case, subject to subsequent equitable adjustments
for stock splits and similar events occurring after the Closing. The Company
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and
shall maintain such reservation for

    

3

 



    

so long as the Replacement Company UPO remain outstanding, a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the
Replacement Company UPO and the exercise of any Replacement Company Warrants
issuable under the Replacement Company UPO.

  

(h)   _OAC Fortress Convertible Notes_. The OAC Fortress
Convertible Notes will be cancelled, retired and terminated and automatically
converted into a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to 35,750
multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration (rounded in the aggregate
for each holder to the nearest whole share) and 32,500 Replacement Company
Warrants (in lieu of OAC Private Warrants).

  

(i)   _OAC Management Convertible Note_. If in accordance with
the terms thereof, a portion of the principal of the OAC Management
Convertible Note is converted by the holders thereof upon the Closing rather
than being repaid in full upon the Closing, the OAC Management Convertible
Note will be converted into, for each $10.00 of principal
converted thereunder, (i) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
(x) 1.1, multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (rounded in the
aggregate for each holder to the nearest whole share) and (ii) one (1)
Replacement Company Warrant (in lieu of an OAC Private Warrant).

  

1.8   _Surrender of OAC Certificates_.

  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall appoint an
agent reasonably acceptable to OAC (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose
of exchanging for stock certificates and warrant certificates for the Merger
consideration certificates, if any were issued, representing OAC Ordinary
Shares, OAC Warrants and OAC Rights (collectively " _OAC Certificates_ ").
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Company shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of OAC Ordinary Shares, OAC
Warrants and OAC Rights as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which, if OAC Certificates were
issued, shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of OAC Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

(b)  Each holder of OAC Ordinary Shares, OAC Warrants and OAC
Rights shall be entitled to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable, upon
delivery to the Exchange Agent of the OAC Certificate(s) for its OAC Ordinary
Shares, OAC Warrants and OAC Rights (if any OAC Certificates were issued),
together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Exchange Agent, new stock certificates and warrant certificates for the Per
Share Merger Consideration in respect of the OAC Ordinary Shares, OAC Warrants
and OAC Rights owned by such holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Cayman Act, regardless of whether any OAC Certificate is surrendered,
each holder of OAC Ordinary Shares (other than Dissenting Shares), OAC
Warrants and OAC Rights shall be entitled to receive their applicable portion
of the Merger consideration upon the Effective Time and shall be reflected as
owning such Merger consideration as of the Effective Time in the Company's and
the Surviving Corporation's books and records.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
in the event that any OAC Certificate which was issued shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, in lieu of delivery of an OAC Certificate to the Exchange
Agent, the holder of the applicable OAC Security may instead deliver to the
Exchange Agent an affidavit of lost certificate in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, which at the reasonable
discretion of the Company may include a requirement that the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed OAC Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to OAC Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Any affidavit of lost OAC

    

4

 



    

Certificate properly delivered in accordance with this Section 1.8(c) shall
be treated as an OAC Certificate for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

(d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of OAC Ordinary Shares, OAC Warrants or OAC Rights.
If, after the Effective Time, OAC Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Company, the Company or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and, if
not previously issued, exchanged for certificates for the applicable portion
of the Merger consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article I. All securities issued upon the
surrender of OAC Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such securities.

  

1.9   _Effect of Transaction on Merger Sub Stock_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any party or any holder of OAC Securities or the holders of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Merger Sub Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into an equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation,
with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

1.10   _Appraisal and Dissenter 's Rights_. No holder of OAC Ordinary
Shares who has validly exercised their rights to dissent from the Merger
pursuant to Section 238 of the Cayman Act (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shareholders_ ") shall be entitled to receive their portion of
the Merger consideration with respect to the OAC Ordinary Shares owned by
such Dissenting Shareholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") unless and until such
Dissenting Shareholder shall have lost its rights to dissent from the Merger
under the Cayman Act. Each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive from OAC (or after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) only the
payment resulting from the procedure in Section 238 of the Cayman Act with
respect to Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Shareholder. In the
absence of agreement between OAC (or after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) and Dissenting Shareholder as to the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares, OAC (or after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and the
Dissenting Shareholder shall take all steps and actions within their
respective control to ensure that the fair value of such Dissenting Shares is
as determined by any one of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
Limited, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young or KPMG, as appointed by OAC
(or after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) to do so. In the event that
any written notices of objection to the Merger are served by any holder of OAC
Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 238(2) of the Cayman Act, OAC (or after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) shall serve written notice of the
authorization and approval of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the
Merger on such shareholders pursuant to Section 238(4) of the Cayman Act
within twenty (20) days of obtaining the Required OAC Stockholder Vote.

  

1.11   _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of OAC and Merger Sub, the officers
and directors of OAC and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

  

1.12   _Section 368 Reorganization_. For U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereby (a) adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section
1.368-2(g) of the United States Treasury Regulations, (b) agree to file and
retain such information as shall be required under Section 1.368-3 of the
United States Treasury Regulations, and (c) agree to file all Tax and other
informational returns on a basis consistent with such characterization. Each
of the parties acknowledge and agree that each (i) has had the opportunity to
obtain independent legal and tax advice with respect to

    

5

 



    

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) is responsible for
paying its own Taxes, including any adverse Tax consequences that may result
if the Merger is determined not to qualify as a reorganization under Section
368 of the Code.

  

Article II _

2.1   _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, the consummation of the Merger and the

OAC's stockholders as necessary for the Required OAC Stockholder Vote and the
Extension), on the part of OAC are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and each Ancillary Document to which it is a party
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement has been, and each Ancillary Document to which OAC is a party shall
be when delivered, duly and validly executed and delivered by OAC and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and
such Ancillary Documents by the other parties hereto, constitutes, or when

Property currently used, licensed or held for use by such Target Company, and

be occurring or has or may have occurred, in any case, in any material
respect, as a consequence of the business activities of any Target Company.

licensed to, or otherwise used or held for use by any Target Company ("
_Company IP_ ").

privacy, personal data protection, and the collection, processing and use of

Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the

current or former officer, director, consultant or employee (or beneficiary

(iii) no Action is pending, or to the Company's Knowledge, threatened (other
than routine claims for benefits arising in the ordinary course of
administration); (iv) no prohibited transaction, as defined in Section 406 of

effected pursuant to a statutory or administration exemption; and (v) all
contributions and premiums due through the Closing Date have been made as
required under ERISA or have been fully accrued on the Company Financials.

  

(e)  No Company Benefit Plan is a "defined benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 414(j) of the Code), a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or is otherwise subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and no Target Company has incurred any Liability or
otherwise could have any Liability, contingent or otherwise, under Title IV of
ERISA and no condition presently exists that is expected to cause such
Liability to be incurred. No Company Benefit Plan will become a
multiple employer plan with respect to any Target Company immediately after
the Closing Date. No Target Company currently maintains or contributes to, or
has ever maintained or contributed to or in any way directly or indirectly had
any Liability (whether contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
"multiemployer plan," within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA. No Target Company currently maintains or has ever maintained, or is
required currently or has ever been required to contribute to or otherwise
participate in, a multiple employer welfare arrangement or voluntary
employees' beneficiary association as defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

  

(f)  There is no arrangement under any Company Benefit Plan
with respect to any employee that would result in the payment of any amount
that by operation of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code would not be
deductible by the Target Companies and no arrangement exists pursuant to
which a Target Company will be required to "gross up" or otherwise compensate
any person because of the imposition of any excise tax on a payment to such
person.

  

(g)  With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is a
"welfare plan" (as described in Section 3(1) of ERISA): (i) no such plan
provides medical or death benefits with respect to current or former employees
of a Target Company beyond their termination of employment (other than
coverage mandated by Law, which is paid solely by such employees); and (ii)
there are no reserves, assets, surplus or prepaid premiums under any such
plan. Each Target Company has complied with the provisions of Section 601 et
seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

  

(h)  Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.21(h)_ , the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents will not: (i) entitle any individual to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or other benefits or compensation; (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation
due, or in respect of, any individual; (iii)

    

26

 



    

result in or satisfy a condition to the payment of compensation that would,
in combination with any other payment, result in an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Target Company
has incurred any Liability for any Tax imposed under Chapter 43 of the Code
or civil liability under Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA.

  

(i)  Except to the extent required by Section 4980B of the
Code or similar state Law, no Target Company provides health or welfare
benefits to any former or retired employee or is obligated to provide such
benefits to any active employee following such employee's retirement or other
termination of employment or service.

  

(j)  All Company Benefit Plans can be terminated at any time
as of or after the Closing Date without resulting in any liability to the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates for any
additional contributions, penalties, premiums, fees, fines, excise taxes or
any other charges or liabilities.

  

(k)  Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A
of the Code (each, a " _Section 409A Plan_ ") as of the Closing Date is
indicated as such on _Schedule 4.21(k)_. No Company Options or other equity-
based awards have been issued or granted by the Company that are, or are
subject to, a Section 409A Plan. Each Section 409A Plan has been administered
in compliance, and is in documentary compliance, with the applicable
provisions of Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder and other
official guidance issued thereunder. No Target Company has any obligation to
any employee or other service provider with respect to any Section 409A Plan
that may be subject to any Tax under Section 409A of the Code. No payment to
be made under any Section 409A Plan is, or to the Knowledge of the Company
will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. There is
no Contract or plan to which any Target Company is a party or is bound to
compensate any employee, consultant or director for penalty taxes paid
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

  

4.22   _Transactions with Related Persons_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 4.22_ , or as set forth in the Company SEC Reports available on
EDGAR, no Target Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any officer,
director, manager, employee, trustee or beneficiary of a Target Company or
any of its Affiliates, nor any immediate family member of any of the
foregoing (whether directly or indirectly through an Affiliate of such Person)
(each of the foregoing, a " _Related Person_ ") is presently, or in the past
three (3) years has been, a party to any transaction, Contract, commitment or
other arrangement with a Target Company that would be required to be disclosed

policy number, insurer, coverage period, coverage amount, annual premium,
type of policy and scope of coverage) held by a Target Company relating to a
Target Company or its business, properties, assets, directors, officers and
employees, copies of which have been provided to OAC. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to a
Target Company, each such insurance policy (i) is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect and (ii) will continue to be legal,
valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect on identical terms
following the Closing. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to a Target Company, no Target Company
is in default with respect to its obligations under any insurance policy, nor
has any Target Company ever been denied insurance coverage for any reason. No
Target Company has any self-insurance or co-insurance programs. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to a Target Company, since April 1, 2012, no Target Company has

any adverse change or any change other than in the ordinary course of
business, in the conditions of insurance, any refusal to issue an insurance

alteration of any of assets of a Target Company, purchase of additional
equipment or material modification of any of methods of doing business by a
Target Company.

  

(b)   _Schedule 4.23(b)_ identifies each individual insurance
claim made by a Target Company since April 1, 2012. Each Target Company has
reported to its insurers all claims and pending circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in a claim, except where such failure to
report such a claim would not be reasonably likely to be material to the
Target Companies. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and
no condition or circumstance exists, that would reasonably be expected to
(with or without notice or lapse of time) give rise to or serve as a basis for
the denial of any such insurance claim. No Target Company has made any claim
against an insurance policy as to which the insurer is denying coverage.

  

4.24   _Top Customers and Suppliers_. _Schedule 4.24_ lists, by dollar
volume paid for each of (a) the twelve (12) months ended on March 31, 2016

Article IX _ 
 TRUST FUND WAIVER_

  

9.1   _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the
IPO Prospectus. The Company warrants and represents that it has read the IPO
Prospectus and understands that the OAC has established the Trust Account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and the OAC Private Placement (including
interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of OAC's public
stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by OAC's underwriters)
(the " _Public Stockholders_ ") and that, except as otherwise described in
the IPO Prospectus, OAC may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a)
to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their OAC
Ordinary Shares in connection with the consummation of OAC's initial business
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) (" _Business
Combination_ "), (b) to the Public Stockholders if OAC fails to consummate a
Business Combination by March 12, 2017 (as extended by the Initial Extension
and the Second Extension, and as it may be further extended by the Extension),
(c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust
Account necessary to pay any taxes or for working capital requirements or (d)
to OAC after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination.
For and in consideration of the OAC entering into this Agreement and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor its Affiliates does now or shall at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom that are paid directly
or indirectly through OAC to Public Stockholders (" _Public Distributions_
"), or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any Public
Distributions), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, any proposed or actual business
relationship between the OAC or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The
Company on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any
Released Claims that the Company or its Affiliates may have against the Trust
Account (including any Public Distributions) now or in the future as a result
of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with OAC or
its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any Public Distributions) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement
with OAC or its Affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such
irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon
by the OAC and its Affiliates to induce OAC to enter in this Agreement, and
the Company further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding
and enforceable under applicable Law. To the extent the Company or any of
its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection
with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the OAC or its
Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief
against the OAC or its Representatives, the Company hereby acknowledges and
agrees its sole

    

49

 



    

remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit any the Company or its Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim
against the Trust Account (including any Public Distributions) or any amounts
contained therein. In the event that the Company or any of its Affiliates
commences an Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to OAC or its Representatives which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
Public Distributions) or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of money
damages or injunctive relief, OAC and its Representatives shall be entitled
to recover from the Company and its Affiliates the associated legal fees and
costs in connection with any such Action, in the event the OAC or its
Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such Action. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of this Section 9.1, the members of the OAC Sponsor Group
shall be deemed to be Affiliates of OAC. This Section 9.1 shall survive
termination of this Agreement for any reason.

its obligations hereunder.

  

10.3   _Third Parties_. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument or document executed by any party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be deemed to
have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a party hereto
or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a party.

  

10.4   _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed
by, construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of

jurisdiction of any Specified Court for the purpose of any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b)

the

    

51

 



    

jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune
