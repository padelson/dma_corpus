number or class of shares by reason of the occurrence of or record date with
respect to any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar readjustment, in any such case within such
period, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date
within such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Per

stock of Parent shall remain issued and outstanding and unchanged.

  

2.3 _ Election Procedures._

  

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the

       

" ** _Election Form_** ") and pursuant to which each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the
Election Form Record Date may make an election pursuant to this Section
2.3, shall be mailed at the same time as the Proxy Statement or at such other
time as the Company and Parent may agree (the date on which such mailing
is commenced or such other agreed date, the " ** _Mailing Date_** ") to each
holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the
record date for notice of the Company Special Meeting (the " ** _Election Form
Record Date_**").

  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Appraisal Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of
such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects
to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (" ** _Stock Election Shares_**
"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration (" ** _Cash Election Shares_** "), or (iii) that such holder
makes no election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock (" **
_No Election Shares_** "). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election
Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the 33rd day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall
agree) (the " ** _Election Deadline_** ") (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of such time) shall also be
deemed to be No Election Shares. If the Closing has not occurred within 10
days of the Election Deadline, then, unless the Closing is then scheduled to
take place by the tenth day thereafter, the Election Deadline shall be
changed, unless Parent and the Company agree that no such change shall be
made, to such tenth day, or such other date as is agreed to by Parent and the
Company, and the Company and Parent shall make a public announcement of such
new Election Deadline, if any.

  

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

  

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by (i) one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all certificated
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form or (ii) in
the case of shares in book-entry form, any additional documents specified by
the procedures set forth in the Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked
prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Parent
shall cause the Certificates, if any, representing Company Common Stock to be
promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form
upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the
Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is
properly made with respect to any or all of the applicable shares of Company
Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made
and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

  

(e) Within ten Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Merger I
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Merger I
Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more

       

than ten Business Days after the Merger I Effective Time), Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company
Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger
in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

  

(i) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

  

(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

  

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of Cash Election Shares (except as provided in the last
paragraph of Section 2.3(e)), a sufficient number of shares (" **
_Stock Designated Shares_** ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will
be paid in the Mergers equals as closely as practicable the Total
Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and

  

(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  

(ii) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

  

(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

  

(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, in each
case pro rata to the holders of No Election Shares or Stock Election Shares,
as the case may be, in accordance with their respective numbers of No
Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as the case may be, a sufficient
number of shares (" ** _Cash Designated Shares_** ") such that the aggregate
cash amount that will be paid in the Mergers equals as closely as practicable
the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and

  

(C) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

  

(iii) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the Cash Election Shares by (y) the Per Share
Cash Consideration is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i)
and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all
Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, for purposes of determining the allocations set
forth in this Section 2.3, Parent shall have the right to require, but not
the obligation to require (unless such requirement is necessary to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(d) or Section 6.3(d)), that any
shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of the
Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares not subject to the pro
rata selection process contemplated by this Section 2.3, and, if Parent so
requires, then, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Appraisal Shares
that receive the Merger Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election
Shares not subject to the pro rata selection process contemplated by this
Section 2.3.

   

6   

  

(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Company.

  

2.4 _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under Delaware law, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger I
Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **
_Appraisal Shares_** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.3, but instead at the
Merger I Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value
of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
and at the Merger I Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited
and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline,
each of such holders Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
at the Merger I Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration into which No
Election Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.3(e) **,**
subject to the last sentence of Section 2.3(e). The Company shall deliver
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock and provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  

2.5 _ Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Company Awards._

  

(a) Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " ** _Committee_**
") shall take all actions necessary under the Companys 1996 Stock Option
Plan (the " ** _1996 Plan_** "), the Companys 1999 Non-Qualified Stock
Option Plan (the " ** _1999 Plan_** "), the Companys 2002 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the " ** _2002 Plan_** ") and the Companys 2004 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (the " ** _2004 Plan_** " and, together with the 1996 Plan,
the 1999 Plan and the 2002 Plan, the " ** _Stock Plans_** ") to cause each
holder of an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under
a Stock Plan, which option is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger I
Effective Time (a " ** _Company Option_** "), to have the right to exercise
such Company Option in full (whether or not vested) immediately prior to the
Merger I Effective Time pursuant to procedures to be established by the
Committee. To the extent any Company Option that has an exercise price per
share that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Cash Consideration is
not so exercised immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time, such
Company Option shall be cancelled at the Merger I Effective Time for no
consideration by virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub. To the extent any
Company Option that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Per
Share Cash Consideration is not so exercised immediately prior to the Merger
I Effective Time (the " ** _In-the-Money Company Options_** "), such In-the-
Money Company Option shall, by virtue of the Mergers and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive, from the Surviving Entity,
as soon as practicable following the Merger I Effective Time, an amount in
cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes and without interest) equal to
the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration over
(B) the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such In-
the-Money Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option immediately prior to
the Merger I Effective Time (whether or not vested). As of the

       

Merger I Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except, with respect to
In-the-Money Company Options, the right to receive the payment described in
the immediately preceding sentence. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the Committee shall take all actions necessary
under the Stock Plans, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.5(a), including providing notice
to the holders of Company Options of such provisions.

  

(b) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, as of the Merger I
Effective Time, the restrictions on each restricted share of Company Common
Stock (the " ** _Company Restricted Stock_** ") granted and then outstanding
under the Stock Plans shall, and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, lapse immediately prior to the
Merger I Effective Time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock
shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each such
share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated at the Merger I Effective
Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the
same conditions, as each share of Company Common Stock not subject to
any restrictions; provided, that upon vesting the holder may satisfy the
applicable withholding Tax obligations by returning to the Surviving Entity
or Parent a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in
value to such obligation. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Company,
the Company Board and the Committee shall take all actions necessary under
the Stock Plans, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate
this Section 2.5(b).

  

(c) Subject to the terms and upon the conditions herein, immediately prior to
the Merger I Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted and
then outstanding under the Stock Plans (each, a " ** _Company Award_**
") shall be fully vested in each holder thereof and the underlying shares
of Company Common Stock shall be issued and will be treated at the Merger
I Effective Time the same as, and shall have the same rights and be subject
to the same conditions as, other shares of Company Common Stock; provided
that upon vesting and issuance, the holder may satisfy the applicable
withholding Tax obligations by returning to the Surviving Entity or Parent a
sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value to such
obligation. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board and the Committee shall take all actions necessary under the Stock
Plans, the award agreements thereunder and otherwise to effectuate this
Section 2.5(c).

  

(d) Except as contemplated by clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, the Surviving
Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Section 2.5 to any holders of Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock or Company Awards such amounts as it may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Awards, as applicable, in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Entity, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

2.6 _ Exchange of Certificates._

  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Companys transfer agent or
a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** "), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent Common
Stock to make pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent
Common Stock as required by this Article II. Parent agrees to make available
to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay
any dividends and other distributions pursuant

       

to Section 2.6(c) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.6(e). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with
Section 2.6(e) and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.6(c)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " ** _Exchange
Fund_**." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by Sections 2.6(c) and 2.6(e) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Merger I Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the
Merger I Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate that immediately prior
to the Merger I Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Shares
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be
in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Merger
I Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates.
Promptly after the Merger I Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such
Certificates and the holders of Certificates who previously surrendered
Certificates to the Exchange Agent with properly completed and duly executed
Election Forms shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A)
shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3 (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3 and this Article II, including cash
payable in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.6(e) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.6(c). No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable
to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.6, each
Certificate other than Certificates representing Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed at any time after the Merger I Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(c).

  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Merger I Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.6. Subject to
applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to such holder of Parent Common Stock issuable in

       

exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash due pursuant to Section 2.3 and cash
payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Merger I Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to the Parent Common Stock and payable with
respect to such Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Merger I Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Common
Stock.

  

(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.6(c) or
Section 2.6(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

  

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common Stock
representing fractional Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of the same
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to have any rights as a holder of any Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the average of
the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by
_The Wall Street Journal_ for the five trading days immediately preceding the
date on which the Merger I Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction
of a Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit such amount with the
Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms
hereof.

  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after 180 days
following the Merger I Effective Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders
of Company Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(c), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent free
and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

(g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange

       

Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.6(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon.

  

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may
be.

  

(j) _Affiliate Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any "affiliate" of the
Company (as determined pursuant to Section 5.16) shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as provided in
Section 5.16.

  

(k) _Book Entry_. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Mergers shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

  

2.7 _ Stock Transfer Books._ At the close of business on the date on
which the Merger I Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on
the records of the Company. From and after the close of business on the date
on which the Merger I Effective Time occurs, any Certificates presented to
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity for any reason shall
be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu
of fractional Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.6(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.6(c), in each case,
without any interest thereon.

Report_** "). The factual, non-interpretive data relating to the Oil and Gas
Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries on which the Company Reserve
Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves set
forth therein, to the knowledge of the Company, was accurate in all material
respects at the time such data was provided to the reserve engineers for the
2005 Company Reserve Report and utilized by the Company for the Interim
Company Reserve Report. The 2005 Company Reserve Report conforms to the
guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for the sale of
substantially all of the Companys Gulf of Mexico assets in 2006 and changes
(including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the
oil and gas industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no
change in respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Since January 1, 2003 all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
wells have been drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced
in compliance in all respects with applicable oil and gas leases and
applicable Laws, except where any noncompliance would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Companys knowledge, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any applicable Law or
contract requiring the Company to plug and abandon any well because the well
is not currently capable of producing in commercial quantities or for any
other reasons. With respect to any Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that are not operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Company makes the representations and warranties set forth
in this Section 3.6 only to its knowledge without having made specific
inquiry of the operators with respect hereto.

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Oil and Gas Interests_** " means
direct and indirect interests in and rights with respect to oil, gas
or minerals, including working, leasehold and mineral interests and
operating rights and royalties, overriding royalties, production payments,
net profit interests and other non-working interests and non-operating
interests; all interests in rights with respect to oil, condensate, gas,
casinghead gas and other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons (collectively, " **
_Hydrocarbons_** ") and other minerals or revenues therefrom, all contracts
in connection therewith and claims and rights thereto (including all oil and
gas leases, operating agreements, unitization and pooling agreements and
orders, division orders, transfer orders, mineral deeds, royalty deeds, oil
and gas sales, exchange and processing contracts and agreements, and in each
case, interests thereunder), surface interests, fee interests, reversionary
interests, reservations, and concessions; all easements, rights of way,
licenses, permits, leases, and other interests associated with, appurtenant
to, or necessary for the operation of any of the foregoing; and all interests
in equipment and machinery (including wells, well equipment and machinery),
oil and gas production, gathering, transmission, treating, processing, and
storage facilities (including tanks, tank batteries,

       

pipelines, and gathering systems), pumps, water plants, electric plants,
gasoline and gas processing plants, refineries, and other tangible personal
property and fixtures associated with, appurtenant to, or necessary for the
operation of any of the foregoing.

  

(c) Set forth in Section 3.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a list of
all material Oil and Gas Interests that were included in the Interim
Company Reserve Report that have been disposed of prior to the date hereof.

")), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any trade
or business, whether or not incorporated, which together with the Company
would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (a " **

and Section 3.10(a)(2) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each material
individual employment, severance or similar agreement with respect to which

18   

  

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan: (i) if intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, such Company Benefit Plan
satisfies the requirements of such sections and has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its

Company; (iii) neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in, and the Company and each Company ERISA Affiliate do not have any
knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or
failed to act in any manner that would subject the Company or any Company
ERISA Affiliate to any liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA
that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company; (iv) no disputes are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any Company ERISA Affiliate, threatened other than ordinary claims for
benefits; (v) neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has engaged
in, and the Company and each Company ERISA Affiliate do not have any

exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the
Code or Section 4975(d) of the Code that could reasonably be expected

made have been properly recorded on the books of the Company or a Company
ERISA Affiliate.

  

(c) No Company Benefit Plan (including for such purpose, any employee benefit
plan described in Section 3(3) of ERISA which the Company or any Company

or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA) or any similar benefits, (ii) neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

and 280G of the Code, respectively, whether or not some other subsequent
action or event would be required to cause such payment or benefit to be
triggered, and (iii) neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall result in, cause
the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of,
any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not some other

       

subsequent action or event would be required to cause such payment or benefit
to be triggered, accelerated, delivered or increased.

(a) Except for such Litigation expressly set forth in the Company

Company, (i) there is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of the

properties or assets or any of the Companys officers or directors (in their
capacities as such), (ii) there is no order, judgment, decree, injunction or
award of any Governmental Entity against and/or binding upon the Company, any

of its Subsidiaries has pending against other parties, where such Litigation
is intended to enforce or preserve material rights of the Company or any of

publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or as individually or
in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have
or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has complied, and is in compliance, with all Laws and
Company Permits that affect the respective businesses of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the Company Real Property and/or the Company Assets, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation of
any such Law or Company Permit; nor has any notice, charge, Claim or action
been received in writing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or been
filed, commenced, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries alleging any violation of the foregoing,
except for such violations or allegations of violations as individually or in
the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of clause (b) above and mindful of the
principles of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
similar applicable foreign Laws, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, in any such case, any of their respective
Representatives has (i) made, offered or authorized any payment or given or
offered anything of value directly or indirectly (including through a friend
or family member with personal relationships with government officials) to an
official of any government for the purpose of influencing an act or decision

Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received notice that any Company Permit will be terminated or modified
or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business, and the Company has
no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination,

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
material contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written
or oral) (i) which is an employment agreement between the Company, on the one
hand, and its officers and key employees, on the other hand, (ii) which, upon
the consummation of the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts
or events, including the passage of time) result in any material payment or
benefit (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or the
acceleration or vesting of any right to any material payment or benefits,
from Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer, director, consultant or employee of
any of the foregoing, (iii) which is a material contract (as defined in Item
601(b)(10)(i) or 601(b)(10)(ii) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed
after the date of this Agreement, (iv) which expressly limits the ability of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or would limit the ability of
the Surviving Entity (or any of its affiliates) after the Merger I Effective
Time, to compete in or conduct any line of business or compete with any
Person or in any geographic area or during any period of time, in each case,
if such limitation is or is reasonably likely to be material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, following the Merger I Effective

Agreement (including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights plan,
restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan) or (vii) which is a shareholder
rights agreement or which otherwise provides for the issuance of any
securities in respect of this Agreement or the Mergers. Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this Section 3.13(a), whether or not included as an exhibit to the Company
SEC Documents, is referred to herein as a " ** _Company Material Contract_**
," and for purposes of Section 5.1(r) and the bringdown of Section 3.13(b)
pursuant to Section 6.3(a), "Company Material Contract" shall include as of
the date entered into any such contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding that is entered into after the date of this Agreement. The
Company has previously made available to Parent true, complete and correct
copies of each Company Material Contract that is not included as an exhibit
to the Company SEC Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, the Companys
charter constitutes a Company Material Contract.

   

22   

  

(b) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding and in full force and
effect and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have performed all
obligations required to be performed by them to date under each Company
Material Contract, except where such failure to be valid and binding or in
full force and effect or such failure to perform individually or in the
aggregate has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except for such matters as
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, to the
Companys knowledge, (i) there does not exist, nor has the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries received written notice of, any breach of or violation or
default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company
Material Contract and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received written notice of the desire of the other party or parties to
any such Company Material Contract to exercise any rights such party has to
cancel, terminate or repudiate such Company Material Contract or exercise
remedies thereunder. Each Company Material Contract is enforceable by the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (x) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws, now or hereafter in
effect, affecting creditors rights generally and (y) the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity) or except where such unenforceability
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

(c) The Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not
subject to (i) any instrument or agreement evidencing or related to
indebtedness for borrowed money, whether directly or indirectly, except for
the Company Credit Agreement and Permitted Liens or (ii) any agreement not
entered into in the ordinary course of business in which the amount involved
is in excess of $1,000,000. In addition, except as set forth in the Company
SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date hereof, no
Company Material Contract contains any provision that prevents the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from owning, managing and operating the Oil and Gas
Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with historical
practices.

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 3.13(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) there are no outstanding calls for
payments in excess of $1,000,000 that are due or that the Company or its
Subsidiaries are committed to make that have not been made; (ii) there are no
material operations with respect to which the Company or its Subsidiaries
have become a non-consenting party; and (iii) there are no commitments for
the material expenditure of funds for drilling or other capital projects
other than projects with respect to which the operator is not required under
the applicable operating agreement to seek consent.

  

(e) Except as reflected in Section 3.13(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there are no provisions applicable to the material Oil and Gas Interests
reflected in the Reserve Report of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
increase the royalty percentage of the lessor thereunder in a manner that is
not accounted for in the Reserve Report; and none of the Oil and Gas

duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by the

likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger
Sub.

  

(b) No material filing or registration with, declaration or notification to,
or order, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity or
any other Person is required to be obtained or made by Parent or Merger Sub,
or any of Parents other Subsidiaries, in connection with the execution,

4.5 _ SEC Reports and Financial Statements._

  

(a) Parent has timely filed with the SEC all forms and documents required to
be filed by it since January 1, 2004 under the Exchange Act, including (A)
its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, (B) its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, (C)
all proxy statements relating to meetings of shareholders of Parent (in the
form mailed to shareholders), and (D) all other forms, reports and
registration statements required to be filed by Parent with the SEC since
January 1, 2004. The documents described in clauses (A)-(D) above, in each
case as amended (whether filed prior to, on or after the date of this
Agreement), are

       

referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " ** _Parent SEC
Documents_**." As of their respective dates or, if amended and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment with respect to those disclosures that are amended, the Parent SEC
Documents, including the financial statements and schedules provided therein
or incorporated by reference therein, (x) did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (y)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other applicable
Laws as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder. None of the Subsidiaries of the Parent is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file any form,
report or other document with the SEC, The New York Stock Exchange, any stock
exchange or any other comparable Governmental Entity.

  

(b) The December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet of Parent (the " **
_Parent Balance Sheet_** ") and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity
and cash flows (including, in each case, the related notes, where
applicable), as reported in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 filed with the SEC under the Exchange
Act, and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the related notes, where applicable) as of September
30, 2006 and the related (i) unaudited consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income for the three and nine-month periods then ended and
(ii) unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine-month period
then ended (in each case including the related notes, where applicable), as
reported in Parents Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2006 filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act,
fairly present (within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the
financial statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of
this Agreement will fairly present (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to recurring audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position and the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders
equity of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the
respective fiscal periods therein set forth; each of such statements
(including the related notes, where applicable) complies, and the financial
statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of this
Agreement will comply, with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and each of
such statements (including the related notes, where applicable) has been, and
the financial statements to be filed by Parent with the SEC after the date of
this Agreement will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation
S-X of the SEC. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have
been, and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. KPMG was an independent public accounting firm for Parent as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents. Ernst and Young LLP is an independent
public accounting firm with respect to Parent and has not resigned (or
indicated that it declines to stand for re-appointment after completion of
the current audit) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Parent.

  

(c) Since January 1, 2000, (A) the exercise price of each Parent Stock
Option has been no less than the Fair Market Value (as defined under the
terms of the respective Parent stock plan under which such Parent Stock
Option was granted) of a share of Parent Common Stock as determined on the
date of grant of such Parent Stock Option, and (B) all grants of Parent Stock
Options were validly issued and properly approved by the Parent Board (or a
duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in material compliance
with applicable Law and recorded in Parents financial statements referred to
in Section 4.5(b) in accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved any
"back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to
the effective date of grant.

4.6 _ Oil and Gas Reserves._

  

(a) Parent has furnished to the Company reserve reports prepared by Parent
and audited by DeGolyer and MacNaughton and Ryder Scott Company
containing estimates of the oil and gas reserves that are owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 (collectively, the " ** _2005
Parent Reserve Report_** ") and another such report audited by DeGolyer and
MacNaughton containing estimates of the Alaskan oil and gas reserves that are
owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2006 (the " **
_2006 Parent Reserve Report_** ") and the internal reserve report
prepared by Parent containing estimates of certain oil and gas reserves
that are owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as of September 30,
2006 (collectively, the " ** _Interim Parent Reserve Report_** ," and
together with the 2005 Parent Reserve Report and the 2006 Parent
Reserve Report, the " ** _Parent Reserve Report_** "). The factual, non-
interpretive data relating to the Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its
Subsidiaries on which the Parent Reserve Report was based for purposes of
estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth therein, to the knowledge of
Parent, was accurate in all material respects at the time such information
was provided to the reserve engineers for the 2005 Parent Reserve Report and
the 2006 Reserve Report and utilized by the Parent for the Interim Parent
Reserve Report. The 2005 Parent Reserve Report and the 2006 Parent Reserve
Report conform to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for
changes (including changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally
affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by production, there
has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve
Report that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Since January 1, 2003 all of Parents and its Subsidiaries wells
have been drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced in
compliance in all respects with applicable oil and gas leases and applicable
Laws, except where any noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. To Parents knowledge, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any Applicable Law or contract requiring Parent of such
Subsidiary to plug and abandon any well because the well is not currently
capable of producing in commercial quantities or for any other reasons. With
respect to any Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are
not operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent makes
the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.6 only to its
knowledge without having made special inquiry of the operators with respect
hereto.

  

(b) Set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter is a list of
all material Oil and Gas Interests that were included in the Interim Parent
Reserve Report that have been disposed of prior to the date hereof.

  

4.7 _ Absence of Certain Changes._

  

(a) Since December 31, 2005, (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective business only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice in all material respects, and (ii) there has not occurred
or continued to exist any event, change, occurrence, effect, fact,
circumstance or condition which, individually or in the aggregate, has had,
or is reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

  

(b) Since September 30, 2006 to the date of this Agreement and except as set
forth in Section 4.7(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) declared, set aside or paid any
dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with
respect to any of Parents capital stock, (ii) effected or authorized any
split, combination or reclassification of any of Parents capital stock or
any issuance thereof or issued any other securities in respect of, in lieu of
or in substitution for shares of Parents capital stock, except for issuances
of Parent Common Stock (1) upon the exercise of Parent Stock Options, in
each case in accordance with their terms at the time of exercise or (2)
in connection with recruitment activities in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (iii) changed in any material
respect, or has knowledge of any reason that would have required or would
require changing in any material respect, any accounting methods (or
underlying assumptions), principles

       

or practices of Parent or its Subsidiaries, including any material reserving,
renewal or residual method, practice or policy, except as required by GAAP or
by applicable Law, (iv) made any material Tax election or settled or
compromised any material income Tax liability, (v) made any material change
in the policies and procedures of Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection
with trading activities, (vi) sold, leased exchanged, transferred or
otherwise disposed of any material Parent Asset other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices, (vii) revalued, or has
knowledge of any reason that would have required or would require revaluing,
any of the Parent Assets in any material respect, including writing down the
value of any of Parent Assets or writing off notes or accounts receivable
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices,
(viii) except as required to comply with applicable Law, adopted or amended
any new or existing Parent Benefit Plan, or (ix) made any agreement or
commitment (contingent or otherwise) to do any of the foregoing.

  

4.8 _ Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities._ Since December 31, 2005 and
except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of
Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of Parents other Subsidiaries, has incurred
any liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or otherwise), except for
(i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business that individually
or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have
or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) liabilities in
respect of Litigation (which are the subject of Section 4.11(a)), and (iii)
liabilities under Environmental Laws (which are the subject of Section 4.15).
None of Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of Parents other Subsidiaries, is in
default in respect of the terms and conditions of any indebtedness or other
agreement which individually or in the aggregate has had, or would be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

4.9 _ Disclosure Documents._

  

(a) None of the information to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in (i) the
Proxy Statement to be filed by the Company and Parent with the SEC, and
any amendments or supplements thereto, or (ii) the S-4 to be filed by Parent
with the SEC in connection with the Mergers, and any amendments
or supplements thereto, will, at the respective times such documents are
filed, and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time the Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to the
Company stockholders and Parent shareholders, at the time of the Company
Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting and at the Merger I Effective
Time, and, in the case of the S-4, when it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be made therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement and the S-4 will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to information provided by the Company specifically for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the S-4.

  

(b) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any document provided to a lender
or potential lender in connection with the Financing (or any amendment or
supplement to such a document), will, at the date on which the Financing is
consummated, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  

4.10 _ Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA._

  

(a) Section 4.10(a)(1) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all the individual or group employee benefit plans or
arrangements of any type (including plans described in Section 3(3) of
ERISA), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which together with Parent would be
deemed a "single employer" within the

       

meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of
ERISA (a " ** _Parent ERISA Affiliate_** ") (" ** _Parent Benefit Plans_**
"), and Section 4.10(a)(2) of the Parent Disclosure Letter lists
each material individual employment, severance or similar agreement with
respect to which Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate has any current or
future obligation or liability (" ** _Parent Employee Agreement_** "). With
respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has made available to the Company
a true, correct and complete copy of such Parent Benefit Plan, and, to the
extent applicable, trust agreements, insurance contracts and other
funding vehicles, the most recent Annual Reports (Form 5500 Series)
and accompanying schedules, summary pan descriptions, and the most
recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service.

  

(b) With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan (i) if intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, such Parent Benefit
Plan satisfies the requirements of such sections and has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (or has a
determination letter application pending with the Internal Revenue Service)
with respect to its qualification, and (except for any such plan with respect
to which a determination letter application is pending with the Internal
Revenue Service) its related trust has been determined to be exempt from tax
under Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the knowledge of Parent,
nothing has occurred since the date of such letter to adversely affect
such qualification or exemption; (ii) each Parent Benefit Plan has
been administered in substantial compliance with its terms and applicable
Law, except for any noncompliance with respect to any such plan that could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent; (iii) neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in,
and Parent and each Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any
Person that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or failed to act in any
manner that would subject Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to any
liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA that could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; (iv) no disputes
are pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate, threatened other than ordinary claims for benefits; (v) neither
Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and Parent and each
Parent ERISA Affiliate do not have any knowledge of any Person that has
engaged in, any transaction in violation of Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption exists under Section 408
of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of the Code that
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent; (vi) all contributions due have been made on a timely basis; and
(vii) except for defined benefit plans (if applicable), such Parent Benefit
Plan may be terminated on a prospective basis without any continuing
liability for benefits other than benefits accrued to the date of such
termination. All contributions made or required to be made under any Parent
Benefit Plan meet the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all
contributions which are required and which have not been made have been
properly recorded on the books of Parent or a Parent ERISA Affiliate.

  

(c) No Parent Benefit Plan (including for such purpose, any employee benefit
plan described in Section 3(3) of ERISA which Parent or any Parent ERISA
Affiliate maintained, sponsored or contributed to within the six-year period
preceding the Merger I Effective Time) is (i) a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) or (iii) except for
the Forest Oil Corporation Pension Plan and The Retirement Income Plan
for Employees of The Wiser Oil Company (collectively, the " ** _Title IV
Plans_** ") subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. No event has occurred with respect to Parent or a Parent ERISA
Affiliate in connection with which Parent could be subject to any liability,
lien or encumbrance with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, except for
regular contributions and benefit payments in the ordinary course of
plan business. With respect to each Title IV Plan, (i) Parent has
made available to the Company the most recent actuarial report for such Title
IV Plan, and there has been no material adverse change in the financial
condition of such Title IV Plan from the date of such actuarial report to the
date of this Agreement, (ii) there has been no "reportable event," as that
term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder,
that would require the giving of notice or any

       

event requiring disclosure under Section 4041(c)(3)(C) or 4063(a) of ERISA,
(iii) all premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " **
_PBGC_** ") have been paid, neither Parent nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate
has filed a notice of intent to terminate such Title IV Plan and has not
adopted any amendment to treat such Title IV Plan as terminated, the PBGC has
not instituted, or threatened to institute, proceedings to treat any such
Title IV Plan as terminated and no event has occurred or circumstance exists
that may constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination
of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, such Title IV Plan.

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(d) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, (i) no present or former employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are covered by any Parent Employee Agreements or Parent Benefit
Plans that provide or will provide any severance pay, post-termination health
or life insurance benefits (except as required pursuant to Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA) or any similar benefits, (ii)
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall cause any payments
or benefits to any employee, officer or director of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to be either subject to an excise Tax or non-deductible to
Parent under Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, respectively, whether or
not some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment or benefit to be triggered, and (iii) neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of,
or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any
employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment or benefit to be triggered, accelerated, delivered or increased.

  

4.11 _ Litigation; Compliance with Law._

  

(a) Except for such Litigation expressly set forth in the Parent SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or
that individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,
(i) there is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
in writing against, relating to or naming as a party thereto Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of Parents other Subsidiaries, any of their respective
properties or assets or any of Parents officers or directors (in their
capacities as such), (ii) there is no order, judgment, decree, injunction or
award of any Governmental Entity against and/or binding upon Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of Parents officers or directors (in their
capacities as such) and (iii) there is no Litigation that Parent or Merger
Sub, or any of Parents other Subsidiaries, has pending against
other parties, where such Litigation is intended to enforce or preserve
material rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Parent SEC Documents filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or as individually or
in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries has complied, and is in compliance with all Laws and Parent
Permits which affect the respective businesses of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Parent Real Property and/or Parent Assets, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries have not been and are not in violation of any such Law or
Parent Permit; nor has any notice, charge, Claim or action been received in
writing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
alleging any violation of the foregoing, except for such violations or
allegations of violations as individually or in the aggregate have not had,
and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of clause (b) above and mindful of the
principles of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other
similar applicable foreign Laws, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, in any such case, any of their respective Representatives has (i) made,
offered or

       

authorized any payment or given or offered anything of value directly or
indirectly (including through a friend or family member with personal
relationships with government officials) to an official of any government for
the purpose of influencing an act or decision in his official capacity or
inducing him to use his influence with that government with respect to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act or other similar applicable foreign Laws, (ii) made, offered or
authorized any payment to any Governmental Entity, political party or
political candidate for the purpose of influencing any official act or
decision, or inducing such Person to use any influence with that government

States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar applicable foreign Laws
or (iii) taken any action that would be reasonably likely to subject Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to any material liability or penalty under any and
all Laws of any Governmental Entity.

  

(d) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits, certifications,
variances, consents, authorizations, waivers, grants, franchises,
concessions, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of Governmental
Entities or other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing, operation,
occupancy and use of the Parent Real Property, Parent Assets and the conduct
of their respective businesses as currently conducted (" ** _Parent
Permits_** "), except where the failure to hold such Parent Permits
individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably
likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Parent Permit
will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such
termination, modification or nonrenewal, in each case except for such
terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that individually or in the
aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result
in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers or any
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not violate any Parent
Permit, or result in any termination, modification or nonrenewal thereof,
except in each case for such violations, terminations, modifications or
nonrenewals that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not
be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

Parent Benefit Plans, ERISA and other employee benefit matters (which are the
subject of Section 4.10), (ii) Tax Laws and other Tax matters (which are
the subject of Section 4.14), (iii) Environmental Laws (which are
the subject of Section 4.15) and (iv) labor matters (which are the subject
of Section 4.17).

  

4.12 _ Intellectual Property._

4.13 _ Material Contracts._

  

(a) Except for such agreements or arrangements that are included as exhibits
to the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement and except as set forth in Section 4.13(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, and except for this Agreement, as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or bound by any material contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) (i) which is an employment agreement
between the Parent, on the one hand, and its officers and key employees, on
the other hand, (ii) which, upon the consummation of the Mergers or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, will (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional acts or events, including the passage of time)
result in any material payment or benefit (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due, or the acceleration or vesting of any right to any
material payment or benefits, from Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer,
director, consultant or employee of any of the foregoing, (iii) which is a
material contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10)(i) or 601(b)(10)(ii) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of this Agreement,
(iv) which expressly limits the ability of the Parent or any Subsidiary of
the Parent, or would limit the ability of the Surviving Entity (or any of its
affiliates) after the Merger I Effective Time, to compete in or conduct any
line of business or compete with any Person or in any geographic area or
during any period of time, in each case, if such limitation is or is

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan)
or (vii) which is a shareholder rights agreement or which otherwise
provides for the issuance of any securities in respect of this Agreement or
the Mergers. Each contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the
type described in this Section 4.14(a), whether or not included as an exhibit
to Parent SEC Documents, is referred to herein as a " ** _Parent Material
Contract_** ," and

       

for purposes of Section 5.1(r) and the bringdown of Section 4.14(b) pursuant
to Section 6.2(a), "Parent Material Contract" shall include as of date
entered into any such contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding that
is entered into after the date of this Agreement. Parent has previously made
available to the Company true, complete and correct copies of each Parent
Material Contract that is not included as an exhibit to Parent SEC Documents.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parents charter constitutes a Parent
Material Contract.

  

(b) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding and in full force and
effect and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be performed by them to date under each Parent Material Contract,
except where such failure to be valid and binding or in full force and effect
or such failure to perform individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Except for such matters as individually or in the aggregate have
not had and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Parent, to the Parents knowledge, (i) there
does not exist, nor has the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries received
written notice of, any breach of or violation or default under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Parent Material Contract and (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of the
desire of the other party or parties to any such Parent Material Contract to
exercise any rights such party has to cancel, terminate or repudiate such
Parent Material Contract or exercise remedies thereunder. Each Parent
Material Contract is enforceable by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to or
limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and
(y) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) or except
where such unenforceability individually or in the aggregate has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

  

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
the Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries are not subject to
(i) any instrument or agreement evidencing or related to indebtedness for
borrowed money, whether directly or indirectly, except for Permitted Liens or
(ii) any agreement not entered into in the ordinary course of business in
which the amount involved is in excess of $1,000,000. In addition, except as
set forth in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to
the date hereof, no Parent Material Contract contains any provision that
prevents Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from owning, managing and
operating the Oil and Gas Interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries
in accordance with historical practices.

  

(d) Except as disclosed in Section 4.13(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

payments in excess of $1,000,000 that are due or that Parent or its
Subsidiaries are committed to make that have not been made; (ii) there are no
material operations with respect to which Parent or its Subsidiaries have
become a non-consenting party; and (iii) there are no commitments for the
material expenditure of funds for drilling or other capital projects other

reflected in any Reserve Report of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that
increase the royalty percentage of the lessor thereunder in a manner that is
not accounted for in such Reserve Report; and none of the Oil and
Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries are limited by terms fixed
by a certain number of years (other than primary terms under oil and gas
leases).

and gas properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the
Parent Reserve Report as attributable to Oil and Gas Interests owned by
Parent and its Subsidiaries and has good and valid title to, or valid
leasehold interests or other contractual rights in, all other tangible
properties and assets (real, personal or mixed) of Parent and its

obligations reflected in the Parent Reserve Report. The oil and gas
leases and other agreements that provide Parent and its Subsidiaries with

individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent and its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) have maintained all of the

nor overproduced, in either case to any material extent, under gas balancing

market prices.

the Company a true, complete and correct copy of each insurance policy or the
binder therefor with respect to their business. All premiums due on such

renewal, except for such defaults or notices as would not constitute a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

such employees, (iv) Parent and its Subsidiaries have each at all times been

work and occupational safety and health, and are not engaged in any unfair
labor practices as defined in the National Labor Relations Act or other
applicable Law, ordinance or regulation, (v) there is no unfair labor
practice charge or complaint against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened before the National Labor
Relations Board or any similar state or foreign agency, (vi) there is no

or threatened claims.

operating units within any site of employment or facility of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (ii) a " _mass layoff_ " (as defined in the WARN Act)
affecting any site of employment or facility of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been affected by any
transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in
number to trigger application of any similar state or local Law, in each case
that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

  

4.19 _ Affiliate Transactions._ Section 4.19 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter contains a complete and correct list of all material
agreements, contracts, transfers of assets or liabilities or other
commitments or transactions (other than Parent Benefit Plans described in
Section 4.10 of the Parent Disclosure Letter), whether or not entered into in
the ordinary course of business, to or by which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective affiliates (other
than Parent or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries) on
the other hand, are or have been a party or otherwise bound or affected, and
that (a) are currently pending, in effect or have been in effect at any time

Transactions entered into after the date of this Agreement will be, entered
into in accordance with applicable Laws, and in accordance with the
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and were,
and will be, entered into with counterparties believed at the time and still
believed to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone
or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such
material Derivative Transactions. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have,
and will have, duly performed all of their respective obligations under the
material Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are and will be
no breaches, violations, collateral deficiencies, requests for collateral or
demands for payment, or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any
party thereunder.

  

4.21 _ Disclosure Controls and Procedures._ Parent has established and
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c)
and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure
that all material information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such

Company Act or the Advisers Act.

       

4.23 _ Rights Agreement._ Parent has taken all action so that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions

to be provided as part of the Merger Consideration.

Parent necessary to approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that in order to approve the Plan Amendment, the

institution has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

other sources of financing (including cash on hand), is sufficient to fund
the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the expenses of Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with the Mergers. Parent has delivered to the

not to, (i) directly or indirectly initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiries regarding or

       

the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company,
(ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose
any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives knows or has reason
to believe is contemplating making an Acquisition Proposal with respect to

Proposal with respect to the Company or (y) that would require, or would have

consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether
or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Board may take any actions described
in clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(a) with respect to a third party at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote if, prior to such vote, (x)
the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not
initiated, solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives after the
date and in violation of this Agreement), (y) the Company Board determines in
good faith by resolution duly adopted (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal from the third party
that made the applicable Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company,
and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith by resolution duly
adopted (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that the third party making such Acquisition Proposal has the
financial and legal capacity to consummate such Acquisition Proposal,
provided that the Company shall not deliver any information to such third
party without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; no
actions taken in accordance with this sentence shall constitute a violation
of clause (i) of this Section 5.3(a). Nothing contained in this Section 5.3
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Companys stockholders a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar disclosure, in
either case to the extent required by applicable Law.

  

(b) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set
forth in paragraph (a) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after the Companys

for information from a Person that has made, or the Company reasonably
believes may be contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company or any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company received from

initiated or continued with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company, and the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by
the Company in connection with any of the foregoing and any correspondence
related thereto, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or
negotiations are taking place. The Company agrees that it shall provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person or group in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company which was not previously provided

       

to Parent as promptly as practicable after it provides such information to
such other Person. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status
of any Acquisition Proposals with respect to the Company (including the
identity of the parties and price involved and any material changes to any
terms and conditions thereof).

  

(c) Neither (i) the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall directly
or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee
thereof of this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " **
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_** ") nor (ii) shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries execute or enter into, any agreement, including
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or
understanding, (A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(a))
(each an " ** _Acquisition Agreement_** ") with respect to the Company or (B)
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Mergers or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Required Vote, and subject to the Companys compliance at all times with the
provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the
definition thereof if the Company Board (i) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company, and (ii) provides written notice
to Parent (a " ** _Company Notice of Change_** ") advising Parent that the
Company Board is contemplating making such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and specifying the material facts and information constituting the
basis for such contemplated determination; provided, however, that (x) the
Company Board may not make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change until
the fourth Business Day after receipt by Parent of the Company Notice of
Change and (y) during such four Business Day period, at the request of
Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes
or modifications to this Agreement which would allow the Company Board not to
make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary
duties.

  

(d) Parent agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective Representatives not to (i)
directly or indirectly initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to Parent, (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
disclose any non-public information relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or to any Person that Parent, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives knows or has
reason to believe is contemplating making an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Parent, or (iii) accept an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Parent or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent or
agreement in principle (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
circumstances contemplated in the penultimate sentence of this Section
5.3(d)), (x) providing for, constituting or relating to an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent or (y) that would require, or would have the
effect of causing, Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to

       

consummate the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of Parents
Subsidiaries or by any Representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement
by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
and Parent Board may take any actions described in clause (ii) of this
Section 5.3(d) with respect to a third party at any time prior to obtaining
the Parent Required Vote if, prior to such approval, (x) Parent receives a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent from such third
party (and such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly
encouraged or facilitated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives after the date and in violation of this
Agreement) and (y) the Parent Board determines in good faith by resolution
duly adopted (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) that such proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal from the third party that made the applicable
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent, and (z) the Parent Board
determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the third party making
such Acquisition Proposal has the financial and legal capacity to consummate
such Acquisition Proposal, provided that Parent shall not deliver any
information to such third party without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; no actions taken in accordance with this sentence
shall constitute a violation of clause (i) of this Section 5.3(d). Nothing
contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from
taking and disclosing to Parents shareholders a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable Law.

  

(e) Parent agrees that in addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in

receipt thereof (but in no event more than 24 hours after Parents receipt
thereof), Parent shall advise the Company in writing of any request for
information from a Person that has made, or Parent reasonably believes may be
contemplating, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent or any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent received from any Person, or any
inquiry made or discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent,
and the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal,

provides such information to such other Person. Parent shall keep the Company
fully informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals with respect to
Parent (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any

or indirectly (A) withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to
the Company), or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a

approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition
Proposal with respect to Parent (any action described in this clause (i)

Acquisition Agreement with respect to Parent (other than an Acceptable

agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,

       

agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding, requiring it to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Required Vote, and subject to
Parents compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and
Section 5.6, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change described in clause (A) of the definition thereof if the Parent Board
(i) determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
described in clause (A) of the definition thereof would be reasonably
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
Parent, and (ii) provides written notice to the Company (a " ** _Parent
Notice of Change_** ") advising the Company that the Parent Board is
contemplating making such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying
the material facts and information constituting the basis for such
contemplated determination; provided, however, that (x) the Parent Board may
not make such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change until the fourth Business
Day after receipt by the Company of the Parent Notice of Change and (y)
during such four Business Day period, at the request of the Company, Parent
shall negotiate in good faith with respect to any changes or modifications to
this Agreement which would allow the Parent Board not to make such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties.

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Acquisition Proposal"_**  shall
mean, with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
any proposal, whether or not in writing (other than by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to the Company, or by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, with respect to Parent), for the (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that generates or
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets (based
on the book or fair market value thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (including capital stock of or ownership interest in any
Subsidiary), (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more
of any class of equity securities or capital stock of such party or any of
its Subsidiaries whose business generates or constitutes 20% or more of the
net revenues, net income or assets (based on the book or fair market value
thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii)
merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer,
recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that
if consummated would result in any Person or Persons beneficially owning 20%
or more of any class of equity securities of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries whose business generates or constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets (based on the book or fair market value
thereof) of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in Section 5.3(g)
of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter. The term "
** _Superior Proposal"_** shall mean, with respect to the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect
to such party that was not initiated, solicited, facilitated or knowingly
encouraged by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives in violation of this Agreement, made by a third
party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, share, exchange, asset purchase or other business
combination, (A) 50% or more of the assets of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) 50% or more of the equity securities of
such party, in each case on terms which the majority of the Board of
Directors of such party determines (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) in good faith by resolution
duly adopted (A) would result in a transaction that, if consummated, is more
favorable to the stockholders of such party (in their capacity as
stockholders) from a financial point of view, than the Mergers, taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by the other
party in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise pursuant to this
Section 5.3), and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal; provided, however,

       

that no proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing
required to consummate the proposal is not committed (unless it is reasonable
to conclude that the proposed acquiror has adequate financial resources to
consummate the transaction).

  

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, any factually accurate and complete public
statement by a party hereto that does nothing more than disclose the receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to such party that was not initiated,
solicited or knowingly facilitated or encouraged after the date of this
Agreement by such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, and the terms thereof, shall not be deemed to be a
recommendation of such Acquisition Proposal or the withdrawal, amendment or
modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors (or any
committee thereof) in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(i) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any possible Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and Parent,
respectively. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it shall (i) take
the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives involved in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken in
this Section 5.3 and (ii) request each Person who has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement within the last 12 months in connection with
such Persons consideration of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to it,
or any similar transaction to return or destroy (which destruction shall be
certified in writing by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf.

  

5.4 _ Access to Information and Properties._

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives
of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of the other party, reasonable
access, including the right to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments
but specifically excluding soil or groundwater sampling or effluent sampling
or testing or subsurface testing of any kind unless consented to in writing
by the Company or Parent, as applicable (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Merger I Effective Time, to all of its
properties, offices, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books
and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other parties all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other parties may
reasonably request. No party or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  

(b) Parent and the Company will hold any information obtained or contemplated
under Section 5.4(a) above in accordance with the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between Lehman Brothers Inc. and Parent, dated as
September 14, 2006, and the confidentiality agreement between the Company and
Parent, dated as of November 13, 2006 (collectively, the " **
_Confidentiality Agreements_** ").

  

(c) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
Representatives made pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth
in this Agreement.

       

5.5 _ Further Action; Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the
conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto, to
obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect
all necessary registrations and filings. Each of the parties hereto will
furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and, subject to applicable Laws and any applicable privilege
relating to the exchange of information, will provide the other parties with
copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity (except
for filings available publicly on the SECs EDGAR system) or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that
neither party is obligated to share any document submitted to a Governmental
Entity that reflects the negotiations between the parties or the valuation of
some or all of any partys business.

  

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts and shall cooperate with the other parties to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the laws, rules, guidelines or
regulations of any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file Notification and
Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " **
_FTC_** ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " **
_Antitrust Division_** ") and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation.

  

(c) Parent shall have the Financing or other funding sufficient to consummate
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and
employees to use all reasonable efforts in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing and any other financing that Parent, in its reasonable
discretion, deems necessary to fund the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event Parent arranges for alternative Financing, it shall promptly
provide to the Company the commitment letter and any similar documentation
with respect thereto. The Commitment Letter shall be in full force and
effect, or if alternative Financing has been arranged, the commitment letter
with respect to such alternative Financing shall be in full force and effect,
at all times until the Effective Time, or the transactions contemplated by
such Commitment Letter or such alternative Financing commitment letter shall
have been consummated.

  

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its advisors and accountants to, provide reasonable and customary
cooperation with Parent and its affiliates in connection with the arrangement
of the Financing and any other financing that Parent, in its reasonable
discretion, deems necessary to fund the transactions contemplated hereby,
including participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows,
rating agency presentations, the preparation of offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses, rating agency presentations, other
marketing material and similar documents, obtaining comfort letters from the
Companys accountants (which comfort letters shall be customary in form,
scope and substance), and obtaining legal opinions from the Companys outside
counsel (which legal opinions shall be customary in form, scope and
substance), as may be reasonably requested by Parent. In conjunction with the
obtaining of any such financing, the Company agrees, at the reasonable
request of Parent, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to prepay or
redeem, or to attempt to renegotiate the terms of, any then
existing indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be obligated to make or cause to become effective
such prepayment or redemption or call for prepayment or redemption or
renegotiated terms (nor shall the Company be required to incur any

       

cost or liability in respect of any such prepayment or redemption or call
therefor or renegotiation thereof) prior to the Merger I Effective Time.

  

(e) In case at any time after the Merger I Effective Time any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Entity shall take or cause
to be taken all such necessary action.

  

(f) Each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Mergers.

  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept, as a condition to
obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any
Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust
(or the imposition of any other condition or restriction with respect to) any
assets or operations of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
affiliates or any of the respective businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Company Assets.

  

5.6 _ Proxy Statement; S-4; Company Special Meeting; Parent Special
Meeting._

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be
filed with the SEC, in connection with the Mergers, the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and the
parties shall file, if necessary, any other statement or schedule relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the
Parent Proposal, Parent, unless relying on the NYSEs "new hire" exception,
shall also include in the Proxy Statement a proposal for an amendment (" **
_Plan Amendment_** ") to the Parent Stock Incentive Plan increasing
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that are available to be issued
under Parents 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the " ** _Parent Stock
Incentive Plan_** "). Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required
to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any
such statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filling, and each of the
Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable thereafter mail the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders.

  

(b) If at any time prior to the Merger I Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub that should be set
forth in an amendment to the S-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall promptly inform the other parties hereto
thereof in writing. All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the time when the S-4 has become effective, of
the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement, the S-4 or the Mergers and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to
the S-4.

  

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and

       

hold, as soon as practicable following the date upon which the S-4 becomes
effective for the purposes of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Mergers, a special meeting of its stockholders for
the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement (such
meeting, including any postponement or adjournment thereof, the " ** _Company
Special Meeting_** "), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Special Meeting no later than 45 days after such date. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3(c), the Company, acting through the Company
Board, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact or circumstance
(except for termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1), this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Special Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement, with such
disclosures as shall be required by applicable Law. At any such Company
Special Meeting following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of
the Company Boards recommendation of this Agreement, the Company may submit
this Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation or with a
negative recommendation (although the approval of this Agreement by the
Company Board may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company
Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto.

  

(d) Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable following
the date upon which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of voting upon
the Parent Proposal and, if applicable, Plan Amendment a special meeting of
its shareholders (such meeting, including any postponements or
adjournments thereof, the " ** _Parent Special Meeting_** "), and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to hold the Parent Special Meeting no later than
45 days after such date. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(d),
Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall (i) recommend approval of the
Parent Proposal and, if applicable, Plan Amendment and include in the Proxy
Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit and obtain such approval. Notwithstanding any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to Parent of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact or circumstance (except for
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1), the Parent Proposal
and, if applicable, Plan Amendment shall be submitted to the shareholders of
Parent at the Parent Special Meeting for the purpose of approval of the
Parent Proposal and, if applicable, Plan Amendment, with such disclosures as
shall be required by applicable Law. At any such Parent Special Meeting
following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
Parent Boards recommendation of the Parent Proposal, Parent may submit the
Parent Proposal and, if applicable, Plan Amendment to its shareholders
without a recommendation or with a negative recommendation of the Parent
Proposal (although the approval of the Parent Proposal by the Parent Board
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Parent Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto.

  

(e) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent,
as the owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub,
will adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

  

(f) The Parent shall use its best efforts to take all actions to consummate
the Second Merger pursuant to Section 1.1(b) as a "short form" merger under
Delaware Law.

   

58   

  

5.7 _ Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any fact, event or circumstance as to which the Company
obtains knowledge that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b). Parent and Merger Sub shall
give prompt notice to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance as to
which Parent or Merger Sub obtained knowledge that would be reasonably likely
to result in a failure of the representation set forth in Section 4.30 or
a condition set forth in Sections 6.2(a) or 6.2(b).

  

5.8 _ Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification._

  

(a) Without limiting any rights that any such Person may have under any
employment agreement or Company Benefit Plan of the Company, after the Merger
I Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, jointly
and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as
described in Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in such
capacities (" ** _Indemnified Parties_** ") to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, in each case against any losses, damages, fines, penalties, expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) or liabilities resulting from any
claim, liability, loss, damage, cost or expense, asserted against, or
incurred by, an Indemnified Party that is based on the fact that such
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and arising out of actions
or omissions or alleged actions or omissions in their capacity as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Merger I Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby). Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, jointly and
severally, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim relating to
any such acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions (a " **
_Proceeding_** ") to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to receive such
advances from Parent or the Surviving Entity within ten Business Days of
receipt by Parent or the Surviving Entity from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; provided that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by law, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding (and in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents. Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense
of any such matter. Parent and the Surviving Entity agree that all rights to
exculpation, advancement of expenses and indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Merger I Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current and former officers and directors of the Company as
provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
Company Material Contract, employment agreement or Company Benefit Plan, in
each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Mergers and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and
without amendment thereof.

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase (after obtaining the
written approval of Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and after the Merger I
Effective Time the Surviving Entity shall maintain, and after Merger II
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or, if the Company has not already done
so, purchase tail directors and officers liability insurance coverage, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, with a claims period of six years from the
Merger I Effective Time, with respect to the directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who are currently covered by the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurance with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred before the Merger I Effective
Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier, in an amount and scope and on terms and
conditions no less favorable to such directors and officers than those in
effect on

       

the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the annual premium for
such insurance shall not exceed 200% of the per annum rate of premium
currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance on the
date of this Agreement. In the event that the annual premium for such
insurance exceeds such maximum amount, Parent shall purchase as much coverage
per policy year as reasonably obtainable for such maximum amount.

  

(c) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  

(d) In the event that the Surviving Entity or Parent, or any of
their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

  

5.9 _ Publicity._ None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, nor any of
their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to the Mergers, this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior consultation of the other party, except as may be required by Law
or by any listing agreement with, or regulation of, any securities exchange
or regulatory authority if all reasonable best efforts have been made to
consult with the other party. In addition, the Company shall to the extent
reasonably practicable consult with Parent regarding the form and content of
any public disclosure of any material developments or matters involving the
Company, including earnings releases, reasonably in advance of publication or
release.

  

5.10 _ Stock Exchange Listing._ Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Mergers to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance as
of the Merger I Effective Time.

  

5.11 _ Employee Benefits._

  

(a) For the one year period beginning at the Merger I Effective Time, Parent
(including, without limitation, the Surviving Entity) shall cause the Company
Employees who continue employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries to receive
(during the period of such employment) (i) at least the same annual base
salary or annual wages, as applicable, as such Company Employees were
receiving immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits on a basis substantially similar to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent; provided, however, that Parent may, in its
discretion **,** continue eligibility for coverage of some or all of the
Company Employees under one or more Company Benefit Plans in lieu of
providing such Company Employees with eligibility for coverage under a
corresponding plan of Parent. To the extent required in any employment
agreement between the Company and any Company Employee, as of the Merger I
Effective Time Parent and the Surviving Entity assume and agree to perform
such agreement.

  

(b) To the extent service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility, participation or vesting (but not the accrual of benefits under
any defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Parent in which Company Employees
may participate, such Company Employees shall be credited for service accrued
as of the Merger I Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the extent such service was credited under a similar plan, program or
arrangement of the Company. Parent agrees that the Company Employees who
continue employment with Parent shall be eligible for a bonus with respect to
the full calendar year in which the Merger I Effective Time occurs on a basis
substantially similar to that provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent;

       

provided, however, that if any such Company Employee commenced employment
with the Company after January 1, 2007, then, subject to the terms of the
applicable bonus plan, such Company Employee shall be eligible for a prorated
bonus based on the period of his or her employment.

  

(c) To the extent Company Employees and their dependents enroll in any health
plan sponsored by Parent, Parent shall waive any preexisting
condition limitation applicable to such Company Employees to the extent that
the employees or dependents condition would not have operated as a
preexisting condition under the group health plan maintained by the Company.
In addition, Parent shall cause such health plans (i) to waive all waiting
periods otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their dependents, other
than waiting periods that are in effect with respect to such individuals as
of the Merger I Effective Time to the extent not satisfied under the
corresponding benefit plans of the Company, and (ii) to provide each Company
Employee and his or her dependents with corresponding credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid by them under the corresponding benefit plans
of Company during the portion of the respective plan year prior to the Merger
I Effective Time.

  

(d) With respect to any Company Employees who become employed by Parent after
the Merger I Effective Time, Parent will permit such Company Employees to
schedule and take vacation days that have accrued prior to the Merger I
Effective Time with pay through December 31, 2007, and Parent shall give
service credit for purposes of determining post Merger I Effective Time
vacation, sick leave and any other paid time off entitlements that
Parent provides to its employees generally.

  

(e) Prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the Company shall amend (i) the
Companys Change of Control Plan to provide that the duties of the plan
administrator under such plan shall be performed by the Company or by one or
more individuals designated from time to time by the Company (rather than the
individual who is the Companys Vice PresidentChief Accounting
Officer immediately prior to the Mergers), (ii) the Companys
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan to eliminate the provisions of section
4.2 of such plan (relating to the appointment of an independent plan
administrator), (iii) each other Company Benefit Plan and related trust
agreement to the extent necessary to eliminate any restriction or limitation
on the Companys ability to appoint the administrator of such Company Benefit
Plan or the trustee of any related trust and (iv) the Companys 401(k) Plan
and Trust and its 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to provide for
the full vesting of all account balances thereunder at the Merger I Effective
Time with respect to participants who are employed by the Company immediately
prior to the Merger I Effective Time. Each such amendment shall be in a form
agreed to by Parent.

  

(f) In addition to the cash-out or cancellation of certain Company Options
pursuant to Section 2.5, Parent shall on the Date of Grant (as hereinafter
defined) grant a stock option under the Parent Stock Incentive Plan (or a
comparable new incentive plan) to each Company Employee who (i) has remained
continuously employed by Parent and its Subsidiaries from the Merger
I Effective Time to the Date of Grant and (ii) held immediately prior to
the Merger I Effective Time a Company Option that had an exercise price per
share at such time equal to or greater than $54.18 (which Company Options
previously have been disclosed to Parent), which option shall be in addition
to and not be considered in lieu of or as satisfaction of Section 5.11(a).
The stock option granted to each such Company Employee (A) shall cover a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option described in clause (ii)
of the immediately preceding sentence and with respect to which such Company
Option was not exercised prior to the Merger I Effective Time (subject to
adjustment as provided in the Parent Stock Incentive Plan), (B) shall have a
purchase price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Fair Market
Value (as such term is defined in the Parent Stock Incentive Plan) of a share
of Parent Common Stock as of the Date of Grant (subject to adjustment as
provided in the Parent Stock Incentive Plan), (C) shall not constitute an
incentive stock option (within the meaning of section 422 of the Code), and
(D) shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as are set forth in
Parents standard form of stock option agreement which shall be used to
evidence such grant

       

(including terms and conditions relating to the term of the stock option, the
vesting of the stock option and the exercise rights of the holder following a
termination of employment). For purposes of this Section 5.11(f), the term "
** _Date of Grant_** " means a Business Day selected by Parent in its sole
discretion that is on or before the fifth Business Day following the date on
which the Merger I Effective Time occurs. Nothing in this Section 5.11(f) nor
any other provision herein shall give any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries the right to be retained in the employ of Parent, the Surviving
Entity or any Subsidiary of Parent, it being understood that none of Parent,
the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary of Parent shall have any obligation to
continue employing any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any
length of time.

  

(g) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects relating to any actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 5.11.
The Company shall allow Parent reasonable opportunities to meet with
employees of the Company from the date hereof to the Merger I Effective Time
in order to discuss and answer questions regarding employment and benefits.

  

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or
be construed as amending, any benefit plan, program or agreement
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent. No Company Employee nor any other Person (other than the parties to
this Agreement) is intended to be a beneficiary of the provisions of this
Section 5.11. Nothing in this Agreement (including Section 5.11(f)) shall
require or be construed or interpreted as requiring Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Company Employee after the
Merger I Effective Time.

  

For purposes of this Section 5.11, a " ** _Company Employee_** " shall mean
an individual who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Merger I Effective Time and who thereafter remains or becomes an employee of
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (including the Surviving Entity).

  

5.12 _ Rights Agreement._ The Company Board shall take such action as
is necessary to terminate the Company Rights Agreement and the Company
Rights immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time and to render the
Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

5.13 _ Certain Tax Matters._

  

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Mergers to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d).

  

(c) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver
to Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, tax counsel for the Company, and
Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in
the form agreed to by the parties and such firms at such time or times as may
reasonably be requested by such firms, including contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, at the time the S-4 is declared effective by the
SEC and the Merger I Effective Time, in connection with such tax counsels
respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d)
hereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to
be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would
cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in
the certificates described in this Section 5.13(c).

  

(d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Mergers that are required or permitted to

       

be filed on or before the Merger I Effective Time. Each of Merger Sub and the
Company shall pay, without deduction from any amount payable to holders of
Company Common Stock and without reimbursement from the other party, any such
Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental Entity, which becomes payable
in connection with the Mergers.

  

(e) Neither Parent nor Company will take (or fail to take) (and following the
Mergers, Parent will cause the Company not to take or fail to take) any
action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to cause
the Mergers to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. With respect to the Mergers, Parent will (and
following the Mergers will cause the Company to) file all
required information with its Returns and maintain all records required for
Tax purposes.

  

(f) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company agrees to (i)
prepare all Returns, other than income tax Returns, for any periods ending
prior to the Closing Date and which are required to be filed within 15 days
following such date (taking extensions to file into account) using
tax accounting methods and principles consistent with those used for
preceding tax periods, unless a change is required by applicable Law or
regulation, and (ii) prepare and submit to Parent income tax Returns,
including quarterly income tax estimates, where such Returns would be
required to be filed prior to 30 days following the Closing Date (taking
extensions to file into account). The Company shall make such income tax
Returns available to the Parent for review prior to filing with the relevant
Governmental Entity and shall not refuse any reasonable request by the Parent
with respect to such Returns. Such Returns shall be prepared and filed, and
all related taxes paid, on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

5.14 _ Indenture Matters._ In the event that Parent elects to obtain a
consent from the holders of outstanding notes under the Company Indenture to
an amendment to Article V of the Company Indenture that would permit a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent in the form of a limited liability company
to merge with the Company and to be the surviving entity in such merger,
which amendment shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
(a) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in
obtaining such consent, (b) upon obtaining such consent, the parties shall
cooperate in implementing an amendment to the Merger Agreement to reflect an
amendment to the structure of the Mergers such that a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent in the form of a limited liability company would merge with the
Company and be the surviving entity in such merger and (c) Parent shall bear
all expenses of Parent and the Company related to such actions referred to in
this Section 5.14.

  

5.15 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company, and their respective Boards of Directors, shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take all actions to cause any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-
Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

  

5.16 _ Affiliates Letter._ Prior to the date of the Company Special
Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of
those Persons who are, in the opinion of the Company, as of the time of the
Company Special Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall provide to Parent such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such list. There shall be added to such list the names and
addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the
Company as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company;
provided, however, that no such Person identified by Parent shall be added to
the list of affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from the
Company,

       

on or before the date of the Company Special Meeting, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such
an affiliate. The Company shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the date of the
Company Special Meeting, from each affiliate of the Company identified in the
foregoing list (as the same may be supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated
as of the Closing Date substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit
A_ (the " ** _Affiliates Letter_** "). Parent shall not be required to
maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 or any other registration statement
under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale by such affiliates of
Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Mergers and Parent may direct
the Exchange Agent not to issue certificates representing Parent Common Stock
received by any such affiliate until Parent has received from such Person an
Affiliates Letter. Parent may issue certificates representing Parent Common
Stock received by such affiliates bearing a customary legend regarding
applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this Section
5.16.

provided hereunder and a summary of the terms and conditions of such
Proposal, (ii) the Company does not, within four Business Days following its

this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties
specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination
is made, and except with respect to this Section 7.2 and Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void after the expiration of
any applicable period following such notice. In the event of such
termination, there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, except as set forth in Section 8.1 of this Agreement and except
with respect to the requirement to comply with the Confidentiality
Agreements; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any
liability with respect to any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other obligation under this Agreement; and provided, further,
that if but for the Companys approval of the Voting Agreement, Parent would
have become an "interested stockholder" subject to the restrictions on

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if either party fails promptly to pay or cause to be paid the amounts due
from it pursuant to this Section 8.1, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment for the amounts
set forth in this Section 8.1, the defaulting party shall pay to the other
party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit and any appeal relating
thereto, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.1
from the date payment was due at 8% per annum.

  

(j) For purposes of Sections 8.1(e) and 8.1(f), the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.3(g),
except that all references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references
to "50%."

   

69   

  

(k) This Section 8.1 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. In no
event shall either party be entitled to receive under this Article VIII more
than an aggregate amount equal to the Company Termination Fee or Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable.

  

8.2 _ Amendment; Waiver._

  

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this Agreement, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after approval by the stockholders of the Company of the matters
presented in connection with the Mergers, but after any such approval no
amendment shall be made without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company if such amendment alters or changes (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) any term of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or
(iii) any terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change
would adversely affect the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

(b) At any time prior to the Merger I Effective Time, the parties to this
Agreement may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the

in part any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
parties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by the other party or (iii) waive in whole or in part
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Any such waiver shall constitute a
waiver only with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and
shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any
other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties
hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions,
to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right
or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are
cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies
that any party may otherwise have at Law or in equity.

  

8.3 _ Survival._ The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificates or other documents delivered prior to or as
of the Merger I Effective Time shall survive until (but not beyond) the
Merger I Effective Time. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto
(including the Surviving Entity after the Mergers) shall survive the Merger I
Effective Time without limitation (except for those which, by their terms,
contemplate a shorter survival period).

for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Disclosure of any matter pursuant to any
Section of the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation as to the

authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term,
provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void, unenforceable, overly

broad and such term, provision, covenant or restriction shall be deemed
modified to the extent necessary to provide the intended benefits to modify

Agreement to any of its Subsidiaries, or to any lender to each of Parent or

obligations to such lender, and provided, further, that no assignment to any
such lender shall in any way affect Parents or Merger Subs obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.

  

8.12 _ Parties in Interest._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party to this Agreement and their
permitted assignees, and (other than Sections 5.8 and 8.11) nothing in this

Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no direct or
indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of any party to this
Agreement (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member,
stockholder or otherwise), nor any affiliate of any party to this Agreement,
nor any director, officer, employee, representative, agent or other
controlling Person of each of the parties to this Agreement and
their respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation arising
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

8.13 _ Specific Performance._ The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity.

  

8.14 _ Jurisdiction._ Each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim,
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of, under or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such claim,
suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it
or any of its affiliates except in such court), and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably and
unconditionally waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding. Each of the parties hereto
further agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
service of any process, summons, notice or document in any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in Section 8.4 shall be deemed effective service of process
on such party. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any such claim, suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions in the world by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
