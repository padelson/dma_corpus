 _RECITALS_

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, the Shareholder Sellers are the record
owners of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company (the " _Company Stock_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, the Company Stock constitutes all of the

 **WHEREAS** , prior to the Closing Date, the Shareholder Sellers and the
Company shall undertake the Pre-Closing Reorganization;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , following the Pre-Closing Reorganization, the Shareholder
Sellers shall own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Equity Seller, and the Equity Seller shall own all of the membership interests
of the Company (the " _Company Interest_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Sellers desire to cause the Equity Seller to sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser all of the Company Interest, and
the Purchaser desires to acquire and accept the Company Interest from the
Equity Seller (collectively, the " _Purchased Equity_ "), in each case upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
PURCHASE AND SALE**

 



 

1.1 _Purchase of Purchased Equity_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, at the
Closing, Shareholder Sellers shall cause Equity Seller to sell, convey,
assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall
purchase, acquire and accept from Equity Seller, all of Equity Sellers right,
title and interest in and to the Purchased Equity.

 



 

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The consideration payable to the Equity Seller for the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Equity shall be (A) an aggregate amount in
cash to be paid on the Closing Date equal to (i) One Hundred Seventy Eight
Million Dollars and No Cents

 



     

 

 



 

($178,000,000.00) _minus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, _minus_
(iii) the Estimated Transaction Expenses and _minus_ (iv) the Seller
Representative Expense Amount (after giving effect to the foregoing, the "
_Closing Cash Purchase Price_ "), (B) the execution and delivery to the Equity
Seller of a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of Twenty-Five
Million Dollars and No Cents ($25,000,000.00) in the form attached hereto as
**Exhibit A** (the " _Note_ "), (C) at the time and on the terms set forth in
the Earn-Out Agreement in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit B** (the "
_Earn-Out Agreement_ "), Purchaser shall pay to the Equity Seller the Earn-
Out, if any, and (D) at the time set forth in Section 5.9 the Tax Equalization
Amounts (collectively, subsections (A), (B), (C) and (D), as they may be
adjusted, comprise the " _Purchase Price_ "). After the Closing, the Closing
Cash Purchase Price may be adjusted pursuant to _Sections 1.5_ , _1.6_ and
_1.7_.

 



 

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Equity
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Dallas, Texas time) at the
offices of Foley Gardere, 2021 McKinney Avenue, Suite 1600, Dallas, Texas
75201 or remotely via electronic exchange of documents and signatures, as
promptly as practicable following, but in no event later than, the second
(2nd) Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ hereof (other than, but subject to
satisfaction of, the conditions to be satisfied on the Closing Date), or on
such other date and at such other time and place as may be agreed to by the
parties in writing. Such time and date are referred to in this Agreement as
the " _Closing Date_ ". Subject to the provisions of _Article VIII_ of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the date
and time and at the place determined pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ shall not
result in the termination of this Agreement and shall not relieve any party to
this Agreement of any obligation under this Agreement.

 



 

1.4 _Payment_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be
delivered:

 



 

(a) to the Seller Representative, an amount in cash equal to the Seller
Representative Expense Amount, by means of a wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account designated in writing by the Seller
Representative at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) to the Equity Seller, an amount in cash equal to the Closing Cash Purchase
Price, by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designated in writing by the Seller Representative at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing; and

 



 

(c) to the Equity Seller, the Note.

 



 

1.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment (Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness)_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Adjustment Statement_. At least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser
a statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Statemen_ t") setting forth the
Seller Representatives good faith estimates of (i) the aggregate amount of
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) the
aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses accrued but unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ").

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Final Adjustment Statement_. As soon as practicable but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall
deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the " _Sellers  Adjustment Statement_")
setting forth the Seller Representatives good faith calculations of (i) the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_ ") and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses
accrued but unpaid as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final
Transaction Expenses_ ").

 



 

(c) Following receipt of Sellers Adjustment Statement, Purchaser shall either
accept Sellers Adjustment Statement, which statement shall then be deemed the
final statement (" _Final Adjustment Statement_ ") or certify to the Seller
Representative its alternate calculation of the Final Closing Indebtedness
and/or the Final Transaction Expenses, as applicable (" _Purchaser s
Adjustment Statement_"). If Purchaser fails to accept the Sellers Adjustment
Statement or deliver to the Seller Representative Purchasers Adjustment
Statement within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Sellers Adjustment
Statement, the Sellers Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties. If Purchaser timely delivers a Purchasers Adjustment Statement,
Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall then make good faith efforts to
meet and resolve the differences between the Sellers Adjustment Statement and
the Purchasers Adjustment Statement. If within thirty (30) days after receipt
by the Seller Representative of the Purchasers Adjustment Statement,
Purchaser and the Seller Representative have been unable to reach agreement,
the parties shall engage the Accounting Firm to determine which calculation of
the Final Closing Indebtedness and/or the Final Transaction Expenses, as
applicable, is more accurate, the Sellers Adjustment Statement or the
Purchasers Adjustment Statement, and shall certify the Accounting Firms
choice as the Final Adjustment Statement. The Accounting Firm shall certify
this decision in writing to Purchaser and the Seller Representative; the
Accounting Firm shall have no other choice but to select either the Sellers
Adjustment Statement in its entirety or the Purchasers Adjustment Statement
in its entirety. The Accounting Firms determination shall be final and
binding on the parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting Firm,
including any attorneys fees related thereto, shall be borne by (i) the
Seller Representative if the Purchasers Adjustment Statement is selected by
the Accounting Firm as more accurate, or (ii) the Purchaser if the Sellers
Adjustment Statement is selected by the Accounting Firm as more accurate.

 



 

(d) Once the Final Adjustment Statement has been determined pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)_, the following shall occur: (i) if the Final Adjustment
Statement reflects that the sum of the Final Indebtedness plus the Final
Transaction Expenses is greater than the sum of the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness plus the Estimated Transaction Expenses set forth in the
Estimated Adjustment Statement, then Seller Representative shall pay (or cause
to be paid) to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds
the amount equal to the surplus within ten (10) Business Days; (ii) if the
Final Adjustment Statement reflects that the sum of the Final Indebtedness
plus the Final Transaction Expenses is less than the sum of the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness plus the Estimated Transaction Expenses set forth in the
Estimated Adjustment Statement, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Equity
Seller an amount equal to such shortfall by wire transfer in immediately
available funds within ten (10) Business Days.

 



 

1.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment (Working Capital Adjustment)_. Following the
Closing, and after seventy-five (75) days, the Seller Representative shall
undertake and prepare a

     

 

 



 

look-back analysis that, in accordance with GAAP, shall determine what the
Companys Working Capital was on the Closing Date. The Seller Representative
and Purchaser agree that the Working Capital shall be calculated as set forth
on _Section 1.6 of the Disclosure Schedules_ hereto. Pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_, the Seller Representative shall provide Purchaser with its
proposed calculation of the Companys Working Capital as of Closing, and
reasonable supporting information relating to its determination of the Working
Capital all as certified in writing by the Seller Representative and delivered
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.2_ (the " _Sellers  WC
Statement_").

 



 

(a) Following receipt of Sellers WC Statement, Purchaser shall either accept
Sellers WC Statement, which statement shall then be deemed the final
statement (" _Final WC Statement_ ") or certify to the Seller Representative
its alternate calculation of working capital (" _Purchaser s WC Statement_").
If Purchaser fails to accept the Sellers WC Statement or deliver to the
Seller Representative Purchasers WC Statement within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Sellers WC Statement, the Sellers WC Statement shall be final
and binding on the parties. If Purchaser timely delivers a Purchasers WC
Statement, Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall then make good faith
efforts to meet and resolve the differences between the Sellers WC Statement
and the Purchasers WC Statement. If within thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Seller Representative of the Purchasers WC Statement, Purchaser and the
Seller Representative have been unable to reach agreement, the parties shall
engage the Accounting Firm to determine which calculation of Working Capital
is more accurate, the Sellers WC Statement or the Purchasers WC Statement,
and shall certify the Accounting Firms choice as the Final WC Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall certify this decision in writing to Purchaser and the
Seller Representative; the Accounting Firm shall have no other choice but to
select either the Sellers WC Statement in its entirety or the Purchasers WC
Statement in its entirety. The Accounting Firms determination shall be final
and binding on the parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting
Firm, including any attorneys fees related thereto, shall be borne by (i) the
Seller Representative if the Purchasers WC Statement is selected by the
Accounting Firm as more accurate, or (ii) the Purchaser if the Sellers WC
Statement is selected by the Accounting Firm as more accurate.

 



 

(b) Once the Final WC Statement has been determined pursuant to _Section
1.6(a)_, the following shall occur: (i) if the Final WC Statement reflects
Working Capital greater than the Required Working Capital, then Purchaser
shall pay the Equity Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds
the amount equal to the surplus to the Equity Seller within ten (10) Business
Days; (ii) if the Final WC Statement reflects Working Capital less than the
Required Working Capital, then the Seller Representative shall pay (or cause
to be paid) to Purchaser an amount equal to such shortfall by wire transfer in
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days.

 



 

(c) For clarification of the above, it is the intent of the parties that at
the time the Company Interest is transferred to Purchaser the Working Capital
shall be at least equal to the Required Working Capital as of the Closing
Date. If any payment owed pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ is not made when due
pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, interest shall accrue on the amount outstanding
at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum until final payment is made.

 



     

 

 



 

1.7 _Purchase Price Adjustment (WIP Adjustment)_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practical after the end of each of the first two calendar
years following Closing Date and then after the completion of all Contracts
entered into before the close of business on the Closing Date (collectively,
the " _WIP Projects_ "), the Seller Representative shall perform an analysis
with respect to the WIP Projects (each such analysis prepared after the end of
a calendar year and after the completion of all such Contracts, the " _WIP
Analysis_ "). Each WIP Analysis shall show the amount by which the Companys
net earnings as of the Closing were overstated or understated by reason of any
improper accruals of revenue and expenses on the WIP Projects as of the
Closing for such period (as if the final amounts had been known as of the
Closing) (the " _WIP Adjustment_ "). The WIP Adjustment shall be determined on
an aggregate basis netting out over and under accruals for such period. The
WIP Adjustment shall be calculated on a contract-by-contract for such period
basis based on the methodology set forth on **_Exhibit C_** attached hereto.

 



 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after completion of each such period, the Seller
Representative shall provide Purchaser with its proposed calculation of the
applicable WIP Adjustment as certified in writing by the Seller Representative
and delivered in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.2_ (each, the "
_Proposed WIP Statement_ "), and Purchaser shall either accept the applicable
Proposed WIP Statement, which will then be deemed final and binding on the
parties, or certify to the Seller Representative Purchasers alternate
calculation of the applicable WIP Adjustment (each, the " _Purchaser s WIP
Statement_"). If Purchaser fails to accept the applicable Proposed WIP
Statement or deliver to the Seller Representative Purchasers WIP Statement
for such period within thirty (30) days of receipt of the applicable Proposed
WIP Statement, the applicable Proposed WIP Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties.

 



 

(c) If Purchaser timely delivers a Purchasers WIP Statement for an applicable
period, Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall make good faith efforts
to meet and resolve any differences between the Proposed WIP Statement and
Purchasers WIP Statement for such period. If within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Seller Representative of Purchasers WIP Statement for such
period, Purchaser and the Seller Representative have been unable to reach
agreement, such parties shall engage the Accounting Firm to calculate the WIP
Adjustment, and shall direct the Accounting Firm to make its determination
within thirty (30) days of its engagement. The WIP Adjustment determined by
the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties; _provided_ ,
that the WIP Adjustment amount calculated by the Accounting Firm shall be
either the WIP Adjustment amount set forth in the Proposed WIP Statement or
Purchasers WIP Statement for such period. The Accounting Firm shall certify
its decision in writing to Purchaser and the Seller Representative. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by (i) the Seller

that jurisdiction or may be required to file Tax Returns in that jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has: (i) collected and withheld

or any of its Subsidiaries. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed,

request for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes has been requested,
granted or are pending. All Taxes due by the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries with respect to completed and settled examinations or concluded
litigation have been paid in full. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has requested or executed an extension or waiver of any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes or any Tax Returns, and neither the Company

Corporation until the Contribution at which time the Company will become and
continue to be through the date of the Conversion a "qualified subchapter S
subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code section 1361(b)(3)(B)) of the Equity
Seller until the Company becomes a disregarded entity with respect to the
Equity Seller upon the Conversion through the Closing Date. Since the
effective date of the Companys election to be taxed in accordance with
Subchapter S of the Code through the date of the Contribution, Sellers and
Company have not taken any action or failed to take any action that would
result in the Company failing to qualify pursuant to Subchapter S of the Code
(including Code section 1361(b)(1)). The Company has not, in the past five (5)

is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. The Company has no potential Liability
for Tax under Code section 1374 or 1375 and will not be liable for any Tax
under Code section 1374 in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. With respect to the Companys Subsidiaries: (1) Walker
Electrical Contractors, Inc. and Walker Engineering, Inc. have been qualified
subchapter S subsidiaries since April 1, 2014, (2) Walker Logistic, LLC and
Walker Service Group, LLC have been disregarded entities since April 1, 2014,

identify any unclaimed property and, to the extent required by applicable law,

through the Closing Date, the Equity Seller).

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by
any Tax allocation, indemnification, sharing or similar agreement (including

the Sellers Knowledge, any other party to any such Key Contract, is in breach

other than as required by GAAP; or

 



 

(j) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) nothing contained herein shall
give to the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
and (ii) the Sellers (in their sole discretion) may and may cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to at any time or from time to time prior to the Closing
use any cash on hand for any purpose (including making distributions or paying
dividends to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, redeeming any equity
interests, paying any Taxes (including estimated Taxes) or repaying any
Indebtedness).

 



 

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date
(or the earlier termination of this Agreement), the Sellers shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to give the Purchaser and its agents and
authorized representatives (including

 



     

 

 



 

prospective lenders) reasonable access in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) to all offices, books and
records, officers, employees and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as the Purchaser may reasonably request (upon reasonable prior notice) during
normal business hours; provided, however, that neither the Sellers nor the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is under any obligation to disclose to the
Purchaser or any such representative any information the disclosure of which
is restricted by Contract or applicable Law or could compromise any applicable
privilege (including the attorney-client privilege) or which the Sellers in
good faith determine is of such a proprietary nature that disclosure prior to
the Closing would not be in the best interests of the Sellers or the Company
and its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser covenants that any investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, nothing herein shall be construed as granting the Purchaser or
its representatives access to any Real Property for purposes of performing
environmental testing, assessment, investigation, sampling or testing without
the prior written approval of the Seller Representative, in its sole
discretion.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, (i) for any reasonable business purpose,
(ii) to the extent necessary for the preparation of financial statements,
regulatory filings or Tax returns of the Sellers or their Affiliates, (iii) in
connection with any Proceeding or (iv) in connection with the determination of
any matter relating to the rights or obligations of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents to which they are party, the Purchaser shall give the Sellers and
their agents and authorized representatives reasonable access to all offices,
facilities, books and records, officers, employees and advisors of the Company
and their Subsidiaries as the Sellers may reasonably request (upon reasonable
prior notice) during normal business hours; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser is not under any obligation to disclose to the Sellers or any such
representative any information the disclosure of which is restricted by
Contract or applicable Law or could compromise any applicable privilege
(including the attorney-client privilege). The Sellers covenant that any
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Any information provided to or obtained by the Purchaser relating to the
Sellers, the Company and any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall be deemed confidential information as described in the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of March 21, 2018, between the Company and Walker
Engineering, Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and shall be held by
the Purchaser in accordance with, and be subject to the terms of, the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the terms
and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Purchaser shall comply with
the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

5.3 _Preservation of Records_. Following the Closing, the Purchaser agrees
that it shall, and it shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, preserve and keep the records held by them or their Affiliates
as of the Closing Date relating to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date. In the
event that the Purchaser (on behalf of itself, or following the Closing on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries) wishes to destroy such records
after that time, the Purchaser shall first give ninety

 



      

 

 



 

(90) days prior written notice to the Sellers and the Seller Representative,
and the Seller Representative shall have the right at its option and expense,
upon prior written notice given to the Purchaser within that ninety (90) day
period, to take possession of the records within one-hundred eighty (180) days
after the date of such notice.

 



 

5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions at the earliest practicable date (including actions
necessary to prevent the entry of any injunction or other Order and to appeal
as promptly as possible any such injunction or other Order that may be entered
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions) and (ii) refrain from taking
any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or impede the
Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Closing to occur by the Outside Date.

 



 

5.5 _Consents_. Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.4_, each of the
parties will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions prior to the Closing, including the consents and
approvals referred to in _Sections 2.5_ , _3.5_ and _4.3_ , and waive any
defaults that could arise or result from the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions and the Transaction Documents. Each of the parties will make or
cause to be made all filings and submissions under applicable Laws as may be
required for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. The parties
will coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information
and assistance as any of the parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing.

 



 

5.6 _Public Announcements_. The parties shall not issue any report, statement
or press release or otherwise make any other public statement with respect to
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions without prior consultation
with and approval of the other parties.

 



 

5.7 _Updates_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, the Seller Representative may prepare and deliver to the Purchaser
supplements and/or amendments to the Disclosure Schedule (which may contain
additional Sections to the Disclosure Schedule that are not in existence as of
the date hereof relating to any of the provisions contained in _Article II_
or _Article III_, in each case, such supplement, amendment or new Sections to
the Disclosure Schedule being referred to as an " _Update_ ") with respect to
matters arising after the date hereof. Any such Update shall be for
informational purposes only and shall not affect the right to indemnification
in accordance with the provisions of _Article VII_ unless specifically agreed
in writing by the Purchaser.

 



 

5.8 _Exculpation, Etc_.

 



 

(a) For six (6) years following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to fulfill and honor its indemnification obligations to its and its
Subsidiaries current and former officers and directors in their capacity as
such pursuant to the Fundamental Documents (as in effect at least ten (10)
days prior to the date of this Agreement) and pursuant to any indemnity
agreements between the Company and its and its Subsidiaries current and
former officers and directors in their capacity as such approved by the Board
of Directors of the

 



     

 

 



 

Company and the Sellers (each as in effect at least ten (10) days prior to the
date of this Agreement and provided that such indemnity agreements have been
delivered to Purchaser).

 



 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each such Person entitled to indemnification,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives.

 



 

5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Seller Representative, at the cost and expense of the Company, shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be filed,
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (the " _Seller Prepared Returns_ "). Such Seller Prepared Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods, and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in
_Section 5.9(a)(iv)_. The Seller Representative shall provide copies of such
Seller Prepared Returns to Purchaser and its authorized representatives for
review at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing thereof, and shall make
such revisions to such Seller Prepared Returns as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any Seller
Prepared Return due after the Closing Date that needs to be signed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Seller Representative shall submit such
Seller Prepared Return to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall cause the
Company or its Subsidiaries to sign and timely file the Seller Prepared Return
in the form submitted by the Seller Representative. Equity Seller shall pay or
cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to such periods and such Tax Returns
(excluding any Taxes included in the Final WC Statement or in Transaction
Expenses); provided, however, this sentence shall not affect the application
of _Section 5.9(g)(iii)_.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, including for such
purposes, any Straddle Period (the " _Purchaser Prepared Returns_ "); provided
Purchaser Prepared Returns shall exclude Form 1120S filled by or on behalf of
the Equity Seller. The Purchaser shall utilize (and cause the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries to utilize) Crowe LLP to prepare the Tax Returns for any
Straddle Period of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the extent that a
Purchaser Prepared Return relates to a Straddle Period, such Tax Return shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the
Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable law, using the same tax
preparers as were used prior to the Closing and, to the extent applicable, the
conventions provided in _Section 5.9(a)(iv)_. At least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date of any Purchaser Prepared Return that relates to a Straddle
Period, the Purchaser shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to the Seller
Representative for the Seller Representatives review and comment. The
Purchaser shall make such revisions to such Purchaser Prepared Returns as are
reasonably requested by Seller Representative.

 



 

(iii) Except as required by law, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, file or amend any Tax Return of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or
otherwise initiate (or

 



     

 

 



 

otherwise participate in) any other Seller Approved Tax Matter without the
prior written permission of the Seller Representative.

 



 

(iv) The Purchaser and the Seller Representative agree with respect to certain
Tax matters as follows:

 



 

(A) That, to the extent permitted by law, any income Tax deduction with
respect to any Transaction Deduction paid or accrued on or prior to the
Closing Date shall be deducted on the Equity Sellers IRS Form 1120S for the
Tax year that includes the Closing Date.

 



 

(B) That no election shall be made to waive the carry back of Tax credit
incurred or realized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(C) To treat any indemnification payments as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all relevant Tax purposes.

 



 

Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that
is final, the Purchaser shall not (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries not to) file a Tax Return that is inconsistent with any
agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)(iv)_, and the Purchaser shall not
(and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to take
any position) during the course of any Tax Contest or other audit or
proceedings that is inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to this _Section
5.9(a)(iv)_.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. To the extent it is not permitted or
required in a jurisdiction to elect to have each Tax year of the Company and
its Subsidiaries end on the Closing Date, such that the Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, the
parties agree to use the following conventions for determining the amount of
Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales
Taxes, employment Taxes and withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
as if the applicable Company and/or its Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return
with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books
methodology." For purposes of the foregoing, (A) any item determined on an
annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions)
shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle
Period as compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; (B)
any Tax or item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit resulting from a
Purchaser Closing Date Transaction shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Closing Date; and (C) any item
of deduction attributable to any Transaction Deductions shall be allocated to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Sellers, the Seller Representative and
the Purchaser shall (and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax
Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) assist in any audit or other
proceeding with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iii) make available any information, records, or other
documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (iv) provide any information required to allow the Sellers, the
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with any information
reporting contained in the Code or other applicable Laws; and (v) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Sellers will pay, and will indemnify and hold the
Purchaser harmless against, any documentary, stamp, stock transfer, or similar
Tax imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Sellers as a
result of the Contemplated Transactions and any related penalties or interest
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ").

 



 

(e) _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(i) If any Governmental Authority issues to the Purchaser or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (1) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct another
proceeding with respect to a Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (2) a notice
of deficiency for Taxes for any such period, the Purchaser shall notify the
Seller Representative of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Authority within ten (10) days of receipt and provide the Seller
Representative with copies of all correspondence and other documents received
from the Governmental Authority. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
control any audit or other proceeding in respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , (1) the Seller Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the
Equity Seller, shall have the right to control (including the settlement or
resolution thereof and the selection of counsel) or participate in any Tax
Contest to the extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and participate
in any Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a Straddle Period; and (2) the
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to,
settle, resolve, or abandon a Tax Contest (whether or not the Seller
Representative participates in or controls such Tax Contest) for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period without the prior written permission of the
Seller Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned).

 



 

(ii) If the Seller Representative elects to control a Tax Contest for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (1) the Seller Representative shall notify the Purchaser
of such intent; (2) the Purchaser shall promptly complete and execute, and
promptly cause the Company or its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, as
applicable, to complete and execute, any powers of attorney or other documents
and take other reasonable actions that the Seller Representative requests to
allow the Seller Representative to control such Tax Contest; (3) prior to the
Seller Representative taking control, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries, to control such Tax Contest diligently and in
good faith and after the Seller Representative takes control, the Seller
Representative shall control such Tax Contest in good faith; and (4) while it
controls a Tax Contest, the Seller Representative shall (A) keep the Purchaser
reasonably informed

 



     

 

 



 

regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (B) allow the Purchaser and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, at the Purchasers sole cost and expense, to
participate in such Tax Contest; and (C) not settle, resolve, or abandon any
such Tax Contest if such settlement, resolution, or abandonment would result
in any Purchaser Indemnitee incurring any material Tax that the Sellers are
not obligated to pay or indemnify under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned).

 



 

(iii) If the Seller Representative elects to participate in a Tax Contest, (1)
the Seller Representative shall notify the Purchaser of such intent; (2) the
Purchaser shall control, or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to control, such Tax Contest diligently and in good faith; (3) the
Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) promptly
take all actions necessary to allow the Seller Representative (and its
counsel) to fully participate in such Tax Contest; and (4) if requested by the
Seller Representative, the Purchaser shall settle (or cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to settle) the Tax Contest on terms acceptable to
the Governmental Authority and the Seller Representative ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such settlement will not result in any Purchaser Indemnitee
incurring any material Tax that the Sellers are not required to pay under this
Agreement).

 



 

(iv) If the Seller Representative does not control or participate in a Tax
Contest (whether by election or otherwise) that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period, (1) the Purchaser shall control, or cause the
applicable Company or Subsidiary, to control such Tax Contest diligently and
in good faith; (2) the Purchaser shall keep the Seller Representative
reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; and (3) if
requested by the Seller Representative, the Purchaser shall settle (or cause
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to settle) the Tax Contest on
terms acceptable to the applicable Governmental Authority and the Seller
Representative ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such settlement will not result
in any Purchaser Indemnitee incurring any material Taxes that the Sellers are
not required to pay under this Agreement).

 



 

(f) _Tax Refunds_. All refunds of Taxes (including refunds of Transfer Taxes)
of the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Tax
Refund_ " and, collectively, " _Tax Refunds_ ") for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as determined in
accordance with the same principles provided for in _Section 5.9(b)_)
(whether in the form of cash received or a credit or offset against Taxes
otherwise payable) shall be the property of the Equity Seller to the extent
such Tax Refund was not included as an asset in the computation of the Final
Working Capital or arises as a result of a Transaction Deduction. To the
extent that the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives a
Tax Refund that is the property of the Equity Seller, the Purchaser shall pay
to the Equity Seller the amount of such Tax Refund (and interest received from
the Governmental Authority) less all reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated
with obtaining such Tax Refund incurred by Purchaser and/or the Company. The
amount due to the Seller Representative shall be payable to the Seller
Representative ten (10) days after receipt of the Tax Refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the Tax Refund is in the form of
credit or offset, ten (10) days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming
such credit or offset). The Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller
Representative to claim (and cause the Company or

 



     

 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable to claim) any refunds that will give
rise to a payment to, or on behalf of, the Equity Seller under this _Section
5.9(f)_.

 



 

(g) _Tax Treatment; Tax Equalization Amounts_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers and Purchaser agree that (x) the Pre-Closing Reorganization
shall be treated as a reorganization described in Code section 368(a)(1)(F)
and Revenue Ruling 2008-18, and (y) the acquisition of the Company shall for
United States federal income tax purposes (and for state income tax purposes
as applicable) be treated as a purchase and sale of assets (and assumption of
the liabilities) of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Purchaser and each
Seller shall file all Tax Returns consistently with this _Section 5.9(g)_,
unless otherwise required by a determination of the Governmental Authority
that is final.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed
consistent with this _Section 5.9_, IRS Form 8594 (and any applicable
corresponding state Tax forms) (such forms, the " _Allocation Forms_ "), and
shall take such other action required pursuant to the Treasury Regulations
under Section 1060 of the Code (and any applicable corresponding state Tax
Laws) to report the allocation of the aggregate Purchase Price, including
assumed applicable liabilities of the Company as of the Closing Date and all
other amounts, in each case to the extent treated as consideration for the
Purchased Equity for federal income tax purposes) (the " _Allocable Purchase
Price_ "), among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding
equity of such Subsidiaries) in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements
consistent with _Schedule 5.9(g)(ii)_. Purchaser shall provide a draft of such
Allocation Forms to the Seller Representative within one hundred twenty (120)
days of Closing, and Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree on a final allocation of the
Allocable Purchase Price. To the extent any adjustments are made to the
aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.5_, _1.6_ , _1.7_ or _5.9_ of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall revise such Allocation Forms in a manner
consistent with final allocation agreed to between Purchaser and the Seller
Representative to reflect any such adjustments. If the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative are unable to agree, the matter shall be resolved
consistent with the Accounting Firm process set forth in _Section 1.5(a)_.
The Company shall provide copies of the Allocation Forms to the Seller
Representative at least ten (10) days before filing the Allocation Forms with
the IRS. The Parties shall agree that the aggregate Allocable Purchase Price
will be allocated to the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Forms for Tax purposes. Neither the Company, any Seller, the Seller
Representative nor Purchaser shall file any Tax Return, or take any position
with a taxing authority, that is inconsistent with such Allocation Forms;
_provided_ , that this shall not prevent a Party from settling a Proceeding
with a Governmental Authority. In the event the Purchase Price, for Tax
purposes, is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement after the Allocation Forms
are filed, the Allocation Forms will be amended to provide that such
adjustments shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance
with the applicable Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(iii) _Tax Equalization Amounts_.

 



 

(A) The Purchaser shall pay to the Equity Seller, as additional consideration
for the purchase of the Purchased Equity, the Tax Equalization Amounts. For
the sake of clarity, payments of the Tax Equalization Amounts are intended to
cause the Shareholder

 



     

 

 



 

Sellers and the Company to be in the same after-Tax economic position with
respect to the sale of the Purchased Equity as they would be if (x) the Pre-
Closing Reorganization does not occur and Equity Seller did not exist, and (y)
the Shareholder Sellers instead directly owned, and had sold to the Purchaser,
all of the Purchased Equity of the Company (taxed as an S corporation under
Code sections 1361 and 1361) pursuant to this Agreement without any election
under Code section 338 or comparable state or local Tax law. Except as
provided in _Section 5.9(g)(C)_, the Purchaser shall pay the amount of the
Tax Equalization Amounts to the Equity Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five (5) days of such the Tax Equalization Amounts
becoming final pursuant to _Section 5.9(g)(iii)(B)_. Any payment in respect
of the Tax Equalization Amounts pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall be
deemed to be an adjustment in the amount of the Purchase Price (exclusive of
any imputed interest imposed pursuant to Code).

 



 

(B) The Seller Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
deliver to the Purchaser a written computation of the Tax Equalization Amounts
within ninety (90) calendar days after the Final WC Statement becomes final.
The calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts shall be prepared consistent
with the Tax Equalization Amount Guidelines, calculated as of the Closing
Date. Following receipt of Equity Sellers Tax Equalization Amounts, Purchaser
shall either accept Equity Sellers Tax Equalization Amounts, which shall then
be deemed final or certify to the Seller Representative its alternate
calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts. If Purchaser fails to accept the
Equity Sellers Tax Equalization Amounts or deliver to the Seller
Representative Purchasers alternate calculation of the Tax Equalization
Amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Equity Sellers Tax
Equalization Amount, the Equity Sellers Tax Equalization Amounts shall be
final and binding on the parties. If Purchaser timely delivers Purchasers
alternate calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts, then the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Seller Representative
of the Purchasers Tax Equalization Amounts, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative have been unable to reach agreement, the parties shall engage
the Accounting Firm to determine, to the extent possible based on the Tax
Equalization Amounts Guidelines, which calculation of the Tax Equalization
Amounts is more accurate, the Equity Sellers Tax Equalization Amounts or the
Purchasers Tax Equalization Amounts, and shall certify the Accounting Firms
choice as the Final Adjustment Statement. The Accounting Firm shall certify
this decision in writing to Purchaser and the Seller Representative; the
Accounting Firm shall have no other choice but to select either the Equity
Sellers calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts in its entirety or the
Purchasers calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts in its entirety. The
Accounting Firms determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The
fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including any attorneys
fees related thereto, shall be borne by (i) the Seller Representative if the
Purchasers calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts is selected by the
Accounting Firm as more accurate, or (ii) the Purchaser if the Equity Sellers
calculation of the Tax Equalization Amounts is selected by the Accounting Firm
as more accurate.

 



 

(C) To the extent any Tax Equalization Amounts increase or decrease for any
reason after the Tax Equalization Amounts are finalized pursuant to _Section
5.9(g)(iii)(B)_, including, without limitation, as a result of (i) changes in
Tax rates and (ii) audits, challenges, investigations or other proceedings by
the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental entity in connection with
or affecting the Tax Equalization Amounts, then in the event of (i) an
increase, the Purchaser shall pay the amount of such increase to the Seller

 



     

 

 



 

Representative (for the benefit of the Equity Seller) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) days of receipt of such written
notice of the same (ii) a decrease, the Sellers Representative (on behalf of
the Equity Seller) shall pay the amount of such increase to the Purchaser by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) days of receipt
of such written notice of the same. Any disputes over the amount of the
increase or decrease shall be resolved consistent with the provisions of
_Section 5.9(g)(iii)(B)_.

 



 

(h) The Parties acknowledge and agree, to the extent permitted by Legal
Requirements and subject to Code sections 483 and 1274, (i) to report for
federal and applicable state Tax purposes the Earn-Out and the Note (exclusive
of applicable interest accruing or imputed thereon) payable by the Purchaser
to the Equity Seller as additional consideration for the Purchased Equity, and
(ii) the Equity Sellers rights to the Earn-Out and the Note and payments
thereunder (exclusive of applicable interest accruing or imputed thereon)
shall be treated as installment obligations for purposes of Code section 453.

 



 

5.10 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. Except as otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement, the Sellers shall not and shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, take (and the Sellers shall not
authorize each of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives or, to the extent within the Companys control, other
Affiliates to take) any action to (a) solicit, initiate or facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Contemplated Transactions or (c)
participate in any way in negotiations with, or furnish any information to,
any Person in connection with, or the making of any proposal that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Sellers shall
and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and
cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal other
than in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

5.11 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries (including the Company)) hereby
releases each Seller and their Affiliates and their respective stockholders,

breach, nonfulfillment or noncompliance of or with the obligations set forth
in _Sections 5.9_ or _5.12_ ), _(d)_ and _(g)_ until the

 



     

 

 



 

total of all such Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds
$900,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall be entitled to recover Losses in excess of the Deductible up to a

(b) _Reduction; Subrogation_. The Purchaser Indemnitees right to

Subsidiaries in each case, net of (x) any related costs and expenses,
including the costs and expenses of pursuing any such claims, and (y) any

(such amount, the " _Net Settlement Amount_ "), and (ii) any accruals or

any Net Settlement Amount after receiving an indemnification payment for the
related Loss, the Purchaser shall pay to the Equity Seller the amount of such
proceeds to the extent such proceeds did not reduce the indemnity payment for
the Loss within ten (10) days of the receipt of such proceeds.

 



 

(c) _No Claims_. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not have any claim for Losses
under this Agreement (i) to the extent that any Liability or obligation arises
as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Purchaser, and
after the Closing Date, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,
(ii) in respect of any Losses caused by or resulting from any action required
or permitted by this Agreement (including _Section 5.1_) and (iii) to the

(d) _Knowledge of Breach_. The right to indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VII_ will not be affected by any investigation
conducted by Purchaser or its representatives with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Purchaser or its
representatives at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant, or
obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty (as may be modified by any Disclosure Schedule), or
on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not
affect the right to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this
_Article VII_, unless such waiver expressly states that it includes a waiver
of rights to indemnification under this _Article VII_. No party shall be
required to demonstrate the actual or constructive knowledge of any other
party as a condition of indemnification for any claim.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) _Limitation on Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Seller
shall be required to pay (or otherwise indemnify for) any Tax of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is not an Indemnified Tax.

 



 

7.5 _Exclusive Remedy; Express Negligence_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, except with respect to the matters set forth in _Sections 1.5_ ,
_1.6_ and _1.7_ and other than in the case of Fraud, the parties agree that,
from and after the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties to this Agreement and the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims
for breach of Contract, warranty, tortuous conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, equity, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) arising out of or based upon the matters set forth in
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, are the indemnification
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Article VII_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing
Date, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights
and claims for Losses it may have against any other party arising under, based
upon or relating to this Agreement, any applicable Law, common law or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article VII_). The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ shall not, however,
prevent or limit a cause of action under _Section 9.13_ to obtain an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof. THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN
THIS _ARTICLE VII_ ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY
PARTY (INCLUDING THE PARTY FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR
PROVES THE CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PARTY
SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE
PARTY SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY SUCH PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO PARTY
SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO
SUCH OTHER PARTYS CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE.

 



 

7.6 _Procedures_. The following procedures shall apply to all claims for
indemnification and reimbursement pursuant to this _Article VII_, other than
those relating to Tax matters, which are governed by _Section 5.9_:

 



 

(a) _Notice of Losses by Purchaser Indemnitee_.

 



 

(i) _Indemnity Claims_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, if any Purchaser Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has a
claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), the Purchaser shall,
promptly after it becomes aware of such Indemnity Claim but in any event prior
to the Indemnification Termination Date, notify the Seller Representative of
such Indemnity Claim by means of a written notice specifying the nature,
circumstances and amount of such Indemnity Claim accompanied by an affidavit
of an officer of the Purchaser setting forth with reasonable particularity the
underlying facts actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant to
exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of such affidavit, the basis for
the Indemnity Claim and setting forth the Purchasers good faith

 



     

 

 



 

calculation of the Losses incurred by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee with
respect thereto, and including copies of all written documentation in the
possession of the Purchaser Indemnitees relating to the circumstances or
events giving rise to such Indemnity Claim (an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_ ").
The failure by the Purchaser to promptly deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice
under this _Section 7.6(a)(i)_ will not adversely affect the applicable
Purchaser Indemnitees right to recovery except to the extent that the Seller
Representative or any Seller is materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) _No Disputes_. If the Purchaser delivers an Indemnity Claim Notice in
accordance with the terms in _Section 7.6(a)(i)_ and the Seller
Representative does not object with the terms of the Indemnity Claim as set
forth in the applicable Indemnity Claim Notice, the Seller Representative
shall (A) deliver (or cause to be delivered) cash in the amount set forth in
such Indemnity Claim Notice, subject to all of the terms and other limitations
contained in this Agreement or (B) the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
shall mutually agree to an offset against the Note in the amount set forth in
such Indemnity Claim Notice.

 



 

(iii) _Disputes_. If Purchaser delivers an Indemnity Claim Notice in
accordance with the terms in _Section 7.6(a)(i)_ and the Seller
Representative objects to the terms of the Indemnity Claim as set forth in the
applicable Indemnity Claim Notice, the Seller Representative may dispute the
related Indemnity Claim by delivery of a notice to the Purchaser in writing,
within thirty (30) days following the Seller Representatives receipt of such
Indemnity Claim Notice, that the Seller Representative objects to the
Indemnity Claim (or the amount of Losses set forth therein) asserted in such
Indemnity Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). Following receipt by the
Purchaser of the Dispute Notice, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative
shall promptly use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to
whether and to what extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification on account of such Indemnity Claim. If the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days
after the Purchaser receives such Dispute Notice, then the dispute must first
be submitted to non-binding mediation to be held in Dallas, Texas. If the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative are still unable to reach agreement
within forty-five (45) days after the first (1st) meeting with the mediator,
then the dispute may only be submitted to, and settled by, an individual
arbitrator mutually selected by the Seller Representative and the Purchaser
(if the Seller Representative and the Purchaser are unable to agree upon the
arbitrator, they shall each select an arbitrator and the two selected
arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as the arbitrator). The
arbitration shall be held in Dallas, Texas pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
Act and in accordance with the then-prevailing International Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association. The agreement to arbitrate will be
specifically enforceable, the award rendered by the arbitrator in respect of a
dispute pursuant to this _Section 7.6(a)(iii)_ shall be final and binding
(absent intentional fraud or manifest error), and any arbitration award may be
enforced by judgment entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees
and expenses of the mediator and the arbitrator shall be allocated between the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the Equity Seller), on the one hand, and
the Purchaser, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the disputed items submitted to the mediator or arbitrator, as the
case may be, that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such disputed items
so submitted. For all purposes of this _Article VII_, the Purchaser and the
Seller Representative shall reasonably cooperate with the other party and its
representatives (including to the extent appropriate and permitted by
applicable

 



     

 

 



 

Law, providing information, records and data), and shall permit reasonable
access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in
connection with the resolution of such disputes.

 



 

(b) Notice of Losses Provided by Seller Indemnitee. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after a Seller Indemnitee obtains knowledge of any matter which
has or may result in Losses, the Seller Representative shall give written
notice of such matter (a " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Purchaser describing the
matter in reasonable detail, and indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary
and to the extent feasible) of the Losses that have been or may be suffered by
the applicable Seller Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to give a Claims
Notice by the Seller Representative to the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
7.6(b)_ will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the
Seller Representative has under this Agreement, or alter or relieve the
Purchaser or the Company of their obligation to indemnify the applicable
Seller Indemnitee except to the extent that they are materially prejudiced
thereby.

 



 

(c) Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims. In the event of any claim by a
third party against any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee for which
indemnification is or may be available under this _Article VII_ (whether
pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the party against whom indemnification may be sought hereunder (the
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be entitled and, if it so elects, shall at its
own cost and expense, (i) take control of the defense and investigation of
such Third Party Claim and (ii) pursue the defense thereof in good faith by
appropriate actions or proceedings promptly taken or instituted and diligently
pursued, including to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice reasonably
acceptable to the party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") to handle and defend such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or
settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects
to assume control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim
in accordance with this _Section 7.6(c)_, the Indemnified Party may, at its
own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.6(c)_ within
fourteen (14) days after delivery of the Claim Notice in connection with such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim
has been asserted shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the
Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and
settlement of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for any resulting settlement of such Third Party Claim and for any
final judgment with respect thereto (subject to any right of appeal), if any,
but only to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement (including
_Sections 7.4_ and _7.5_ hereof). In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified
Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the
claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

 



 

(d) To the extent this _Section 7.6_ is inconsistent with _Section 5.9(e)_
with respect to any Tax matter, the provisions of _Section 5.9(e)_ shall
control.

 



     

 

 



 

7.7 _Mitigation_. Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any
of its Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Each of the parties shall cooperate
with the others with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect
to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder,
including by using reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any such
claim or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that such party shall not be
required to make such efforts if they would be detrimental in any material
respect to such party. In the event that any party shall fail to use
reasonable best efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then
(unless the proviso to the foregoing sentence shall be applicable)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the other party shall not be
required to indemnify or reimburse any Person for any Losses that could have
been avoided if such party had made such efforts.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated and
the Contemplated Transactions may be abandoned:

 



 

(a) at any time, by mutual written agreement of the Seller Representative and
the Purchaser;

 



 

(b) at any time after May 1, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ "), by the Seller
Representative upon written notice to the Purchaser if the Closing shall not
have occurred, unless the failure to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
is the result of a breach by the Sellers of any of their respective
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement;

 



 

(c) at any time after the Outside Date, by the Purchaser upon written notice
to the Seller Representative, if the Closing shall not have occurred, unless
the failure to consummate the Contemplated Transactions is the result of a
breach by the Purchaser of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties agree that the
Purchaser shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(c)_ during the pendency of any legal proceedings by the Sellers
and/or the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section 9.13_;

 



 

(d) by the Seller Representative, if the Purchaser breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement in
a manner such that any conditions under _Section 6.1(a)_ and _Section
6.1(b)_ would not be satisfied, and such breach is not cured within twenty
(20) days after written notice to the Purchaser by the Seller Representative;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no cure period will be required for any such
breach that by its nature cannot be cured;

 



 

(e) by the Purchaser, if the Sellers breach any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement in
a manner such that any conditions under _Section 6.1(a)_ and _Section
6.1(b)_ would not be satisfied, and such breach is not cured within twenty
(20) days after written notice to the Seller Representative by the Purchaser;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no cure period will be required for any such
breach that by its nature cannot be cured; or

 



      

 

 



 

(f) by either the Purchaser or the Seller Representative if a Governmental
Authority shall have issued an Order permanently restraining or prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and such Order shall have
become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ is not available
to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in or
causes such Order or such party is not in compliance with its obligations
under _Section 5.4_;

 



 

8.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. Any party desiring to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party or parties, as the case may be, to this
Agreement. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to _Section 8.1_
hereof, this Agreement shall become void and there shall be no liability on
the part of any party hereto except the obligations provided for in _Sections
5.2(c)_ , _5.6_ , this _Article VIII_, _Article IX_ (in respect of those
provisions that survive) and the definitions set forth in _Article X_ hereof
shall survive any such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, or
otherwise fails to occur as a result of the action or inaction of the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall pay to the Equity Seller an amount in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the Termination Fee,
which shall be paid within ten (10) Business Days of the Purchasers receipt
of the notice of such termination.

 



 

(b) If the Purchaser fails to pay the Termination Fee, as required pursuant to
this _Section 8.3_, when due, the Termination Fee shall accrue interest for
the period commencing on the date the Termination Fee became past due until
paid, at a rate equal to 5% per annum. In addition, if the Purchaser fails to
pay the Termination Fee, as required pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, when
due, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller Representative all of the costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with all actions to collect
the Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) If the Purchaser is obligated to pay the Termination Fee, the actual
receipt by Seller Representative of the Termination Fee (plus any amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_) will be deemed to be liquidated damages
and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers against the Purchaser
Indemnitees and no Purchaser Indemnitee will have any other liability or
obligation with respect to this Agreement (and the termination hereof), and
the Contemplated Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) including the
failure of the Closing to occur or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and neither the Sellers nor the Seller Representative will be
entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action, or proceeding (whether
in contract, tort, or otherwise) against the Purchaser or any other Purchaser
Indemnitee arising out of this Agreement, any of the Contemplated Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3(c)_ are an integral part of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, and (ii) in light of the difficulty of accurately determining
actual damages with respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of
this Agreement after payment in full of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)_, the right to such payment constitutes a reasonable estimate
of the losses that will be suffered by reason of any such termination of this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages (and not a penalty). The parties
acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Purchaser be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX

9.1 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date, at the

reasonably request in order to give effect to the Contemplated Transactions.

9.3 _Exhibits and Schedules_. Any matter, information or item disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule or in any Exhibit attached hereto, under any specific
representation or warranty or section number hereof, shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the matter relates, so long as the description of such
matter in the Disclosure Schedule reasonably indicates its relevance to the
pertinent section. The mere inclusion of any matter, information or item in
any Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by the Sellers or
any other Person to any third party or otherwise imply that any such matter,
information or item is material or creates a measure for materiality for the
purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such inclusion
of a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

 



 

9.4 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. Except as provided in _Section
5.7_, this Agreement, including any Exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule, may be
amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by written agreement signed
by the Seller Representative and the Purchaser. Any failure of the Sellers to
comply with any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived by the
Purchaser, and any failure of the Purchaser to comply with any term or
provision of this Agreement may be waived by the Seller Representative, at any
time by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such other party,
but such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure to comply. Further, neither the waiver by any
of the parties of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions, to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder.

 



 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule and the
Exhibits, and other documents referred to herein (including the
Confidentiality Agreement), and which form a part hereof, contain the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject

 



     

 

 



 

matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, oral and written, with respect to its subject matter (other
than the Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement for any
reason is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such decision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, which other provisions shall remain in full force and effect and
the application of such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law. Upon such declaration that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Contemplated Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

9.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns, but except as
contemplated herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written consent
of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Representative
may execute and deliver any such written consent on behalf of the Sellers. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 9.7_ shall be void.

 



 

9.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) the Seller Representative, (ii)
current and former, stockholders, members, managers, officers, directors and
employees of the Company pursuant to _Section 5.8_ and (iii) as provided in
_Article VII_ with respect to the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and their permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person (including any employee or former employee of the Company) or entity
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



 

9.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Article I_ and
_Sections 5.9_ and _7.6(a)(iii)_ , whether or not the Contemplated
Transactions are consummated pursuant hereto, each party hereto shall pay all
fees and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Sellers
shall be responsible for all expenses incurred by the Company prior to the
Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

 



 

9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more
counterparts (delivery of which may be by facsimile or via email as a portable
document format (.pdf)), each of which will be deemed an original, and it will
not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms of this
Agreement to produce or account for more than one (1) of such counterparts.

 



     

 

 



 

9.11 _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any cost estimates, Projections or other
forward-looking statements contained or referred to in this Agreement or in
the Disclosure Schedule or Exhibits hereto or in any materials that have been
provided to the Purchaser by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates are not and shall not be deemed to be
representations or warranties of the Sellers. The words "include," "includes"
and "including" are deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation."
The words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to
this Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Schedule and any other
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, and not to any particular section, subsection,
paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement. The words
"party" or "parties" shall refer to parties to this Agreement. References from
or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or
through and including, respectively. The words "dollar" or "$" shall mean U.S.
dollars. The word "threatened" or any variation thereof means "threatened in
writing". The word "day" means calendar day unless Business Day is expressly
specified. The term "written" in respect of Contracts shall be interpreted to
mean handwritten, typed or printed Contracts (as opposed to oral) that have
been executed by two counterparties pursuant to a handwritten signature, and
shall not be deemed executed by virtue of an oral, electronic or email
acknowledgement or signature. Any reference to the masculine, feminine or
neuter gender shall include such other genders and any reference to the
singular or plural shall include the other, in each case unless the context
otherwise requires. If any action under this Agreement is required to be done
or taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be
required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first (1st) succeeding
Business Day thereafter. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed
according to their fair meaning and neither for nor against any party hereto
irrespective of which party caused such provisions to be drafted. Each of the
parties acknowledges that it has been represented by counsel in connection
with the preparation and execution of this Agreement.

 



 

9.12 _Legal Representation_. The Purchaser hereby agrees, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates and each of their respective directors,
managers, stockholders, members, partners, officers and employees, and each of
their successors and assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "),
that Foley Gardere / Foley and Lardner LLP (or any successor thereof) (the "
_Law Firm_ ") may represent the Seller Representative, the Sellers and each of
their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller
Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and thereby (such
representation, the " _Current Representation_ "), and the Law Firm may
represent the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee
or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in each case in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including under _Sections 1.5_ , _1.6_ and _1.7_ and _Article
VII_, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or thereby (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") notwithstanding such representation (or any continued
representation) of the Company, its Subsidiaries, and the Purchaser on behalf
of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably
waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto. The Purchaser acknowledges that the

 



     

 

 



 

foregoing provision applies whether or not the Law Firm provides legal
services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. The
Purchaser, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications between the Seller Group and their counsel,
including the Law Firm, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or proceeding
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, or any matter relating to any
of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group and
such counsel and neither the Purchaser, nor any Person purporting to act on
behalf of or through the Purchaser or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to
obtain the same by any process. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall and shall cause the Company to, on behalf of itself and the Waiving
Parties, waive and not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to
any communication between the Law Firm and any Person in the Seller Group
occurring during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation.

 



 

9.13 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with the specific terms
thereof or otherwise breach such provisions, and that money damages would not
be an adequate remedy, even if available. The parties accordingly agree (on
behalf of themselves and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
provided in _Section 9.8_) that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Sellers (and the Seller
Representative on behalf of the Sellers) and the Purchaser shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof (except the parties
obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and the Purchasers
obligation to pay, and the right of the Equity Seller to receive, the Purchase
Price which remedy is covered in its entirety by _Section 8.3_) in any court
of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

9.14 _Forum; Service of Process_. Each of the parties submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Dallas, Texas, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that
all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in any such court and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each of the parties
agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might
be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address of
the party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
9.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that

 



     

 

 



 

nothing in this _Section 9.14_ shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party hereto agrees
that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law.

 



 

9.15 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the
State of Texas, excluding choice of law principles that would require the
application of the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Texas.

 



 

9.16 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE
PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS
BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE SCOPE OF
THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT
MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND
ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT
EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT
EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER
IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN
WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE
COURT.

 



 

9.17 _Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) Pursuant to and in accordance with the Seller Representative Agreement,
the Seller Representative has been authorized to act as agent and attorney-in-
fact for and on behalf of the Sellers regarding any matter under this
Agreement or otherwise relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

(b) The Seller Representative will not be liable for any act taken or omitted
to be taken as Seller Representative while acting in good faith, and any act
taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Seller Representative shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements
furnished to it by any Seller, the Company and any of their respective
Affiliates, the Purchaser and any third party or any other evidence deemed by
the Seller Representative to be reliable, and the Seller Representative shall
be entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by

 



     

 

 



 

it. The Seller Representative shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under this Agreement or any related document or agreement
if it shall have received such advice or concurrence as it deems appropriate
with respect to such inaction, or if it shall not have been expressly
indemnified to its satisfaction against any and all liability and expense that
the Seller Representative may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action.

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Purchaser is entitled to deal
exclusively with the Seller Representative on all matters relating to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and agrees to deal with the
Seller Representative on an exclusive basis. A decision, act, consent or

then holders of this note, to the exclusion of all prior holders not then
retaining or reserving an interest in this note, to the end that all the
rights, powers, remedies, liens, benefits and privileges accruing and to
accrue hereunder to Payee, as such term is used herein, shall inure to the
benefit of and be owned and held by the holder or holders of this note from
time to time, whether such holder acquires this note through succession to or
assignment from a prior Payee.

 



 

(e) " _Purchase Agreement_ " means that certain Purchase Agreement, dated as
of February 21, 2019, among Sellers, Sellers Representative, the Company and

2. **Payments of Principal and Interest.**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the date when the principal under this note has
been paid in full, interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal amount of
this note at the rate of four percent (4.00%) per annum, and shall be paid
quarterly in arrears in cash. In addition, all accrued and unpaid interest on
the unpaid principal balance of this note shall be due and payable at the
Maturity Date. Such interest shall be computed for the actual number of days
elapsed in a year consisting of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. In the

(the "Default Rate") until such unpaid amount is repaid in cash.

 



 

(b) The principal of this note shall be due and payable in two equal

($12,500,000.00) each, _less_ any

 



     

 

 



 

offset pursuant to _Section 2(c)_. The first installment shall be due and
payable on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, and the second
installment shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date; _provided_ , that

The provisions of this Paragraph shall control all agreements, whether now or hereafter existing and whether written or oral, between Maker and Payee.

(a) any part of the Debt, including any interest thereon, is not paid when
due, whether by lapse of time or acceleration or otherwise, unless such
default is fully cured within fifteen (15) calendar days after such due date.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) any proceeding is instituted by or against the Maker under any present or
future bankruptcy or insolvency statutory or similar law and, if involuntary,
the same are not stayed or dismissed within ninety (90) days, or the Maker

conservator or other judicial representative is appointed for the Maker.

extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of other
remedies available to Payee, whether hereunder or by judicial proceedings or
otherwise, to enforce the observance or performance of the covenants and
agreements contained in this note. No delay or omission by Payee to exercise
any right or power accruing upon any default hereunder shall impair such right
or power or shall be construed as a waiver or acquiescence therein. Every
power and remedy given to Payee by this _Section 4_ or by law may be
exercised by Payee from time to time and as often as Payee shall deem
expedient.

 **COMFORT SYSTEMS USA, INC.,**

 



 



 

 **DATED AS OF [ ], 2019**

     

 

 



 

 ** _EARN-OUT AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This **Earn-Out Agreement** (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [
], 2019, is by and among Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Purchaser_ "), , a Texas corporation (the " _Equity Seller_
"), Scott Walker, Brent Walker, Charles Walker, the Scott Walker GST Exempt

_Seller_ " and, collectively, the " _Sellers_ ") and Scott Walker, in his
capacity as the Seller Representative. Purchaser, Sellers, and Seller
Representative are sometimes individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ "
and collectively as the " _Parties_."

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Equity Seller owns all equity interests of the Company;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Purchaser and the Shareholder Sellers are party to that
certain Purchase Agreement dated as of February 21, 2019 (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Purchaser will purchase from the Equity
Seller, and the Equity Seller will sell to Purchaser, the Purchased Equity
upon the terms and conditions set forth therein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , it is a condition to closing of the Contemplated Transactions
that the Parties execute and deliver this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Purchaser has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, to pay to the Equity Seller additional Purchase Price based on
the future financial performance of the Company after the Closing during the
applicable period described in this Agreement (individually and/or
collectively, as the case may be, the " _Earn-Out_ ").

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

SECTION 1 _Earn-Out_.

 



 

(a) The Earn-Out for each applicable period shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(i) for the period from the Closing Date until December 31, 2019, the Earn-Out
shall be an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the EBITDA (as
defined below) for such period that exceeds Thirteen Million Two Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($13,250,000.00);

 



 

(ii) for the period from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, the Earn-Out
shall be an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the EBITDA during
such

     

 

 



 

period that exceeds Twenty-One Million Dollars and No Cents ($21,000,000.00)
(the " _Threshold Amount_ ");

 



 

(iii) for the period from January 1, 2021 until December 31, 2021, the Earn-
Out shall be an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the EBITDA for
such period that exceeds the Threshold Amount;

 



 

(iv) for the period from January 1, 2022 until December 31, 2022, the Earn-Out
shall be an amount equal to forty-five percent (45%) of the EBITDA for such
period that exceeds the Threshold Amount; and

 



 

(v) for the period from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023, the Earn-Out
shall be an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the EBITDA for such
period that exceeds the Threshold Amount.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _EBITDA_ " means (without duplication),
with respect to any applicable period, the net income of the Company and its
subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, _plus_ , the amount of interest expense
(net of any interest income) deducted in determining net income, _plus_ , the
amount of Taxes related to the earnings or income of the Company and its
subsidiaries (whether accrued or paid in cash or deferred) deducted in
determining net income, _plus_ , the amount of depreciation and amortization
related to the Company and its subsidiaries deducted in determining net
income; and EBITDA shall not include (i) any overhead charges or any
management fees paid to Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (other than
expenses paid for goods and services procured on an arms-length basis in the
ordinary course of business such as insurance, fuel, employee benefits, etc.),
(ii) goodwill and other intangibles amortization, that are a result of
Purchasers purchase of the Purchased Equity, (iii) any gain, loss, income or
expense resulting from any changes in Purchasers accounting methods,
principles or practices or a material change in GAAP, and (iv) any
"extraordinary items" of gain or loss as that term is defined in GAAP. For
purposes of calculating the Earn-Out, EBITDA will be calculated in accordance
with GAAP. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Earn-Out, EBITDA for
any applicable period shall be: (i) reduced by any amounts accrued for payment
to Equity Seller by Purchaser for the WIP Adjustment for the applicable period
of computation, or (ii) increased by any amounts accrued for payment to
Purchaser by Equity Seller for the WIP Adjustment for the applicable period of
computation. It is the express intention of the Parties that EBITDA shall be
calculated in a manner to fairly reflect the true economic return of the
Company as an incremental and separate part of Purchaser. The Parties shall
use the same financial information and accruals for calculation of the Earn-
Out hereunder as they use for calculation of the WIP Adjustment under the
Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(c) Purchasers obligation to pay any Earn-Out payment in accordance with this
Agreement is an independent obligation and is not otherwise conditioned or
contingent upon the satisfaction of any conditions precedent to any preceding
or subsequent Earn-Out. For the avoidance of doubt and by way of example, if
the conditions precedent to the payment of the Earn-Out for the period ended
December 31, 2019 are not satisfied, but the conditions precedent to the
payment of another period are satisfied, then Purchaser would be obligated to
pay such

 



     

 

 



 

Earn-Out for such other period for which the corresponding conditions
precedent have been satisfied, and not the Earn-Out for the period ended
December 31, 2019.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the combined total of all
Earn-Out payments made to Equity Seller pursuant to this _Section 1_, shall
not exceed Fifty Million Dollars and No Cents ($50,000,000.00).

 



 

(e) Purchaser and the Sellers each agree that during the period of time from
the Closing Date through the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the payment to
the Equity Seller of the maximum amount of the Earn-Out: (i) the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be operated as a separate business unit
of the Purchaser, and (ii) none of the Purchaser, the Company or the Sellers
shall, directly or indirectly take any actions in bad faith that would have
the purpose of augmenting, avoiding or reducing the Earn-Out.

 



 

SECTION 2 _Payment of Earn-Out_. Within ten (10) days after the Earn-Out for a
period is finally determined pursuant to _Section 3_ herein or after an Earn-
Out Default, Purchaser will pay the Earn-Out for such period, if any, to the
Equity Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by Seller Representative. If any Earn-Out is
not paid by Purchaser to the Equity Seller when due hereunder, such amount
shall accrue interest from and including the date such payment was due through
the date such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to 5%. Such
interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year and the
actual number of days elapsed, without compounding. Subject to the limitations
and other provisions set forth in Article VII of the Purchase Agreement, the
Purchaser shall have the right to set-off any indemnifiable Losses for which
Sellers are responsible against any Earn-Out otherwise due and payable
hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 3 _Procedures to Determine Earn-Out_.

 



 

(a) On or before sixty (60) days following the end of each period described in
_Section 1(a)_, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a
proposed written calculation of the Earn-Out earned, if any, as certified in
writing by the Seller Representative and delivered in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 6_. Purchaser shall provide the Seller Representative
and his representatives with access to the books and records of the Company
and its subsidiaries, and shall otherwise cooperate with and reasonably assist
the Seller Representative in taking such acts as may be necessary to allow
Seller Representative to calculate the Earn-Out in accordance with this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) If Purchaser disputes the Seller Representatives calculation of the Earn-
Out, Purchaser shall so notify Seller Representative within thirty (30) days
after receipt of Seller Representatives written calculation referred to in
_Section 2_, and submit to the Seller Representative the Purchasers proposed
calculation of the Earn-Out in writing certified by the Purchasers Chief
Financial Officer and delivered in accordance with the provisions of _Section
6_. If Purchaser does not dispute the Seller Representatives calculation of
the Earn-Out and provide Seller Representative with Purchasers calculation
within such 30-day period, the Seller Representatives calculation of the
Earn-Out shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Purchaser disputes
Seller Representatives calculation and provides Seller Representative with

 



     

 

 



 

Purchasers calculation within such 30-day period, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall then make a good faith effort to meet and resolve the
difference between Purchasers calculation and the Seller Representatives
calculation. If within thirty (30) days after receipt of Purchasers
calculation, Purchaser and the Seller Representative have been unable to reach
agreement, Purchaser and the Seller Representative within fifteen (15) days
thereafter shall jointly select an independent certified public accounting
firm, or if they are unable to do so, within twenty (20) days thereafter
either Purchaser or the Seller Representative shall request the American
Arbitration Association to designate a firm of independent certified public
accountants having no past or current affiliation with Purchaser, Purchasers
Affiliates, the Sellers, or the Sellers Affiliates (such selected accounting
firm being referred to herein as the " _Arbitrator_ "), to determine whether
Purchasers or the Seller Representatives calculation is most accurate. The
Arbitrator shall certify this decision in writing to the Parties, and shall
have no choice but to select either the Purchasers calculation in its
entirety or the Seller Representatives calculation in its entirety (there
shall be no award of pre-judgment interest). The Arbitrators determination
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of
the Arbitrator, including any attorneys or experts fees related thereto,
shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party.

 



 

SECTION 4 _Modification and Waiver of Breach_. No waiver or modification of
this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing signed by the
Purchaser and Seller Representative. No waiver of a breach hereof shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver of a future breach, whether of a similar or
dissimilar nature.

 



 

SECTION 5 _Assignment_. The rights and obligations of Purchaser under this
Agreement may, without the consent of the Seller Representative, be assigned
by Purchaser, in its sole and unfettered discretion, (a) to any subsidiary or
Affiliate of Purchaser, provided that in the event of any such assignment
Purchaser must guarantee all obligations hereunder, (b) to any transferee,
whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, that directly or indirectly acquires
all or substantially all of the assets or business of Purchaser, or (c) as
collateral to any lender or provider of financing to the Purchaser or any
subsidiary or affiliate of the Purchaser. Except as expressly provided in the
preceding sentence, no Party may directly or indirectly assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Parties.

SECTION 7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 



 

SECTION 8 _Gender; "Including" is Not Limiting; Descriptive Headings_. The
masculine and neuter genders used in this Agreement each includes the
masculine, feminine and neuter genders, and the singular number includes the
plural, each where appropriate, and vice versa. Wherever the term "including"
or a similar term is used in this Agreement, it shall be read as if it were
written "including by way of example only and without in any way limiting the
generality of the clause or concept referred to." The descriptive headings are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile or
scanned and emailed ( _i.e_., Portable Document Format (pdf)) transmission of
any signed original document or retransmission of any signed facsimile or

documents and will be deemed the same as delivery of an original. At the

the Parties will confirm facsimile or scanned and emailed transmission by
signing a duplicate original document.

 



 

SECTION 11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and all other documents dated as

prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

SECTION 12 _Reformation and Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be separable and a determination that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, unenforceable or void shall not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In case
any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or
void, it shall, to the extent possible, be modified and/or interpreted in such
manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable, but so as to most nearly retain
the intent of the Parties, and if such modification is not possible, such
provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and in either case, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any court of
competent jurisdiction is authorized and directed by the Parties to enforce
any otherwise invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision in part, to modify
it, to enforce it only to a degree and not fully, or otherwise to enforce that
provision only in a manner and to an extent, or for a shorter period of time,
that renders the provision valid or enforceable. The intent of the Parties is
that this Agreement be enforceable and enforced to the maximum extent possible
after excising (or deeming excised) all invalid or unenforceable provisions,
whether or not the remaining provisions are grammatically correct.

 



 

SECTION 13 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. The Parties
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Texas in Houston, and/or any state district court of
the State of Texas located in Harris County, Texas in any action, suit or
proceeding brought by or against such Party in connection with, arising from
or relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any
document contemplated herein or otherwise relating hereto, and each Party
hereby waives and further agrees not to assert as a defense in any such suit,
action or proceeding any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such courts, that the venue of the suit, action or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such courts. THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE IRREVOCABLY ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A TRIAL BY JURY IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY
DOCUMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR OTHERWISE RELATED HERETO.

 **EXHIBIT C 
SAMPLE WIP ADJUSTMENT CALCULATION**

 



 

The WIP Adjustment shall be calculated on a contract-by-contract basis using
the following formula:

 



    

WIP 
Adjustment

 |  



 |  

=

 |  



 |  

Final Revenue Earned

 |  



 |  

X

 |  



 |  

(

 |  



 |  

 _Cost to Date @ Closing Date_ 
Final Total Costs

 |  



 |  

)

 |  



 |  

-

 |  



 |  

Revenue Earned @ Closing Date

 |  



 |  

-

 |  



 |  

Any loss that would have been accrued as of Closing Date in accordance with
GAAP 

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
 



 

For example, if at the Closing the Company has earned $800,000 of revenue and
accrued $600,000 of expenses with respect to a particular project and upon
completion of the project, total revenue is $1,000,000 and total costs are
$650,000, the WIP Adjustment with respect to that project would be positive
$123,077, reflecting the additional margin that would have been reflected as
of the Closing. Also, for example, if at the Closing, the Company has
recognized $800,000 of revenue and incurred $600,000 of expenses with respect
to a particular project, and upon completion of the project, total revenue
earned is $1,000,000 and total expenses are $1,100,000, the WIP Adjustment
with respect to that project would be negative $300,000, composed of $200,000
in margin that had been incorrectly recognized as of the Closing plus $54,546
representing the amount of the loss that had been spent before the Closing,
plus $45,454 representing the amount of expected loss that would have been
accrued pursuant to GAAP as of the Closing for the project.

 **ARTICLE 7**

 



 

 **REPAIRS; REPLACEMENTS; MAINTENANCE**

 



 

 **Section 7.1. **Except for repairs, replacements or maintenance required to

provided in this Section 7.1, Tenant, at Tenants sole cost and expense, (i)
shall take good care of the Premises and the fixtures, equipment and

making such Maintenance Repair or Requirement Alteration at the time made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.1, in no

replacement to the extent such repair, item of maintenance or replacement is
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlords

 **Section 7.2. ** To the extent assignable, Landlord hereby assigns all
warranties and guaranty agreements relating to the Premises and the Building
Systems to Tenant during the Term.

Landlord. Landlord shall not be responsible for, and there shall be no
abatement of any Base Rent or Additional Rent due hereunder as a result of,
any temporary interruptions or inconveniences caused by such repairs,
maintenance or replacements by Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an

actions such that all or a portion

 



     

 

 



 

of the Premises is rendered untenantable, as objectively determined using a
commercially reasonable standard, and Landlord fails to repair such Essential
System within fifteen (15) days after receiving Notice from Tenant of such
condition, then Tenants Base Rent and Additional Rent shall thereafter abate
for the untenantable portion of the Premises until such Essential System is
fully repaired.

Insurance_** "); and Tenant, at Tenants own expense, shall comply with all

Mortgagee and Tenant, the Premises Insurance in an amount equal to the
replacement value of the Building and its contents (not to exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000)) and commercial general liability insurance (including
premises operation, bodily injury, personal injury, death, independent
contractors, products and completed operations, broad form contractual
liability and broad form property damage coverages) with coverage limits of
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) in the aggregate, against all claims, demands or actions with
respect to damage, injury or death made by or on behalf of any Person, arising

(b) Landlord and any Mortgagee shall be named as additional insureds in each
such policy. Each such policy of insurance shall be: (i) written as an
"occurrence" policy; (ii) written as primary policy coverage and not
contributing with or in excess of any

 



     

 

 



 

coverage which Landlord may carry; and (iii) issued by a reputable and
independent insurance company which is rated in Bests Insurance Guide, or any
successor thereto (or if there be none, an organization having a national
reputation), as having a general policyholder rating of "A" and a financial
rating of at least "XI" and which is licensed to do business in Texas. Upon
Landlords request, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the policies of insurance
or certificates thereof, together with evidence of payment of premiums
thereon, and shall thereafter furnish to Landlord, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of any such policy and any renewal thereof, a new
policy or certificate in lieu thereof, with evidence of the payment of
premiums thereon. Each such insurance policy shall also contain a provision
whereby the insurer agrees not to cancel, fail to renew, diminish or
materially modify such policy without having given Landlord and any Mortgagee
at least thirty (30) days prior written Notice thereof.

 



 

(c) Tenant shall pay all premiums and charges for all of such insurance

to carry any such policy, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, make
such payment or carry such policy, and the amount paid by Landlord, with
interest thereon at the Applicable Rate, shall be repaid to Landlord by Tenant
on demand by Landlord, and all such amounts so repayable, together with such
interest, shall be deemed to constitute Additional Rent hereunder. The payment
by Landlord of any such premium, or the carrying by Landlord of any such
policy, shall not be deemed to waive or release the default of Tenant with
respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Tenant, at Tenants sole cost and expense, shall maintain insurance
protecting and indemnifying Tenant against all damage to or loss of Tenants
Property and all claims and liabilities relating thereto.

shareholders, partners, directors, officers, employees and agents from any
claim or action for damage to the Premises or Tenants Property to the extent
that such claim or action is covered by proceeds of any insurance policy
maintained by the parties hereto under the terms of this Lease or in force at
the time of any such damage. Each party shall cause each insurance policy
obtained by it to provide that the insurance company waives all rights of
recovery by way of subrogation against the other party in connection with any
damage covered by any such policy.

 



 

(b) The waiver of subrogation described in Section 10.4(a) shall extend to the
employees and agents of each party, but only if and to the extent that such
waiver can be obtained without additional charge (unless such party shall pay
such charge). Nothing contained in this Section 10.4 shall be deemed to
relieve Landlord or Tenant from any duty imposed elsewhere in this Lease to
repair, restore and rebuild the Premises, in whole or in part.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11**

 



 

 **DESTRUCTION BY FIRE OR OTHER CAUSE**

 



 

 **Section 11.1.** If the Premises or any part thereof shall be damaged by
fire or other casualty, Tenant shall give immediate written Notice thereof to
Landlord. Landlord shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 11.2 and 11.3,
proceed with reasonable diligence, after receipt of the net proceeds of
insurance, to repair or cause to be repaired such damage at its expense within
one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of damage, to the condition
immediately preceding such damage and, if the Premises, or any part thereof,
shall be rendered untenantable by reason of such damage, then the Base Rent
hereunder, or an amount thereof apportioned according to the area of the
Premises so rendered untenantable (if less than the entire Premises shall be
so rendered untenantable), shall be abated for the period from the date of
such damage to the date that is thirty (30) days after the date when the
repair of such damage shall have been substantially completed. If Landlord or
any Mortgagee shall be unable to collect the insurance proceeds applicable to
such damage because of some action or inaction on the part of Tenant or
Persons Within Tenants Control, then Landlord shall have no duty to make such
repairs or effect any restoration hereunder and the Base Rent hereunder, or
the amount thereof that would have been apportioned pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, shall not abate. Tenant covenants and agrees
to cooperate with Landlord and any Mortgagee in their efforts to collect
insurance proceeds (including rent insurance proceeds) payable to such
parties. Landlord shall not be liable for any delay which may arise by reason
of adjustment of insurance on the part of Landlord and/or Tenant, or any cause
beyond the control of Landlord or contractors employed by Landlord.

 



 

 **Section 11.2.** Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or
annoyance to Tenant or injury to the business of Tenant resulting in any way
from damage from fire or other casualty or the repair thereof unless caused by
the willful misconduct or grossly negligent act or failure to act of Landlord
or Persons Within Landlords Control. Tenant understands that Landlord, in
reliance upon Section 10.3, will not carry insurance of any kind on Tenants
Property and that Landlord shall not be obligated to repair any damage thereto
or replace the same.

 



 

 **Section 11.3. ** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Sections 11.1 and 11.2, in the event that:

 



 

(a) at least fifty percent (50%) of the rentable square feet of the Premises
shall be damaged by a fire or other casualty so that substantial alteration or
reconstruction of the Premises shall be required (whether or not the remainder
of the Premises shall have been damaged by such fire or other casualty and
without regard to the structural integrity of the Premises);

 



 

(b) the Premises shall be totally or substantially damaged or shall be
rendered wholly or substantially unsuitable for the Permitted Use;

 



 

(c) Landlord fails to commence any repairs, reconstruction or restoration of
the Premises within sixty (60) days after a casualty; or

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Landlord fails to complete all repairs, reconstruction or restoration of
the Premises within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of casualty;

 



 

then, as a result of any circumstances described in clauses (a), (b), (c), or
(d) above, Tenant, at Tenants sole unilateral option, may terminate this
Lease and the term and estate hereby granted, by notifying Landlord in writing
of such termination within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of any
damage described in clause (a) or (b) above or within thirty (30) days after
the passage of the applicable time period specified in clause (c) or (d)
above. In the event that such a Notice of termination shall be given, then
this Lease and the term and estate hereby granted shall terminate as of the
date of termination stated in such Notice with the same effect as if that date
were the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as
applicable, and the Base Rent and Additional Rent hereunder shall be
apportioned as of such date. Notwithstanding the termination of this Lease as
provided in this Section 11.3, Landlord shall be obligated to reimburse to
Tenant a portion of the cost of any Maintenance Repair or Requirement
Alteration to the extent required by Section 7.1.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 11.A**

 



 

 **CAPTIVE LEASE TERMINATION PROVISION**

 



 

 **Section 11.A.1.** If during the Term of the Lease, both Brent Walker and
Scott Walker shall cease to be an employee of Comfort or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates for any reason (including but not limited to
retirement, voluntary termination, involuntary termination, death, disability,
or termination without cause) ("cause" being defined by the terms of the
respective employment agreements of Brent Walker and Scott Walker with Tenant
dated as of the date hereof), then Tenant shall have the option, exercisable
at its sole discretion, upon two hundred seventy (270) days written Notice
provided within sixty (60) days after such termination, to vacate the Premises
and cancel the Lease without any recourse by Landlord (neither at law nor in
equity nor in tort). In the event Landlord sells the Premises to a Person
other than (i) an affiliate, (ii) Tenant or (iii) an affiliate of Tenant, the
provisions of this Article 11.A shall immediately terminate and be of no
further and effect upon the closing of such sale.

 **Section 12.1.** If the whole of the Premises is acquired or condemned for
any public or quasi-public use or purpose, this Lease and the Term shall end
as of the date of the vesting of title with the same effect as if such date
were the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as
applicable. If only a part of the Premises is so acquired or condemned then,
except as provided below in this Section 12.1, this Lease and the Term shall
continue in effect but, if a part of the Premises is so acquired or condemned,
from and after the date of the vesting of title, the Base Rent and Additional
Rent, if any, shall be reduced in the proportion which the area of the part of
the Premises so acquired or condemned bears to the total area of the

 



     

 

 



 

Premises immediately prior to such acquisition or condemnation. If the part of
the Premises acquired or condemned contains more than fifty percent (50%) of
the rentable square feet of the Premises or if, by reason of such acquisition
or condemnation, the Premises shall, in Tenants reasonable judgment, be
rendered wholly or substantially unsuitable for the Permitted Use, then
Tenant, at Tenants option, may terminate this Lease and the Term and estate
hereby granted, by notifying the Landlord in writing of such termination
within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date upon which Tenant receives
Notice of vesting of title. In the event that such Notice of termination shall
be given, then this Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted shall
terminate as of the date of termination stated in such Notice, with the same
effect as if such date were the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date
of any Option Period, as applicable. In the event of any termination of this
Lease and the Term pursuant to the provisions of this Section 12.1, the Base
Rent or Additional Rent shall be apportioned as of the date of sooner
termination and any prepaid portion of the Base Rent for any period after such
date shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant.

 



 

 **Section 12.2.** In the event of any such acquisition or condemnation of
all or any part of the Premises, Landlord shall be entitled to receive the
entire award for any such acquisition or condemnation, but shall be obligated
to proceed with reasonable diligence to repair and restore the Premises, at
Landlords expense, to a condition reasonably suitable for the Permitted Use.
Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or the condemning authority for
the value of any unexpired portion of the Term, and Tenant hereby expressly
assigns to Landlord all of its right in and to any such award. Nothing
contained in this Section 12.2 shall be deemed to prevent Tenant from making a
separate claim in any condemnation proceedings for (a) the value of any of
Tenants Property included in such taking and (b) any moving expenses, in each
case so long as Landlords award is not reduced thereby.

 



 

 **Section 12.3.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Sections 12.1 and 12.2, in the event that:

 



 

(a) Landlord fails to commence any repairs, reconstruction or restoration of
the Premises within sixty (60) days after the physical taking of any portion
of the Premises; or

 



 

(b) Landlord fails to complete all repairs, reconstruction or restoration of
the Premises within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of such
physical taking;

 



 

then, as a result of any circumstance described in clause (a) or (b) above,
Tenant, at Tenants option, may terminate this Lease and the term and estate
hereby granted, by notifying the Landlord in writing of such termination
within thirty (30) days after the passage of the applicable time period
specified in clause (a) or (b) above. In the event that such a Notice of
termination shall be given, then this Lease and the term and estate hereby
granted shall terminate as of the date of termination stated in such Notice
with the same effect as if such date were the Fixed Expiration Date or the
Expiration Date of any Option Period, as applicable, and the Base Rent and
Additional Rent hereunder shall be apportioned as of such date.
Notwithstanding the termination of this Lease as provided in this Section
12.3, Landlord shall be obligated to

 



     

 

 



 

reimburse to Tenant a portion of the cost of any Maintenance Repair or
Requirement Alteration to the extent required by Section 7.1.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 13**

 



 

 **ASSIGNMENT; SUBLETTING**

 



 

 **Section 13.1.**

 



 

(a) Tenant shall not: (i) assign this Lease without the prior consent of
Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (ii) mortgage or
encumber Tenants interest in this Lease, in whole or in part; or (iii)
sublet, or permit the subletting of, the Premises or any part thereof without
the prior consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13.1, the use of the
Premises by any Person "affiliated" (as such term is defined below) with the
Tenant or under the "common control" (as such term is defined below) of
Comfort, as the case may be, shall not be deemed an assignment of this Lease
or a sublet of the Premises. For purposes of this Section 13.1(a), a Person
shall be deemed to be an " ** _affiliate_** " of the Tenant or under the " **
_common control_** " of Comfort if such Person is a member of a "parent-
subsidiary controlled group" or a member of a "brother-sister controlled
group" which either Comfort or Tenant, as the case may be, is a member.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions otherwise set forth in this Article 13,
neither any reorganization, consolidation and/or restructuring of Tenant nor
any sale or transfer of any stock of Tenant shall be deemed an assignment of
this Lease or a sublet of the Premises.

 



 

(c) In no event shall any assignment of this Lease or any subletting of the
Premises release Tenant from any liability hereunder. Tenant shall pay for any
and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Landlord, including
reasonable attorneys fees, in connection with any proposed assignment or
subletting, whether consummated or not.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 14**

 



 

 **ACCESS TO PREMISES**

 



 

 **Section 14.1.** Landlord or Landlords agents shall have the right to
enter the Premises at all reasonable times upon (except in case of emergency)
reasonable prior notice, which notice may be oral, (a) to examine the
Premises, (b) to show the Premises to prospective purchasers, Mortgagees or
(within the last nine (9) months of the Term) tenants, and (c) to make such
repairs, alterations, improvements or additions as Landlord (i) may deem
necessary or required under the terms of the Lease or (ii) may elect to
perform at least twenty (20) days after notice (except in an emergency, when
no notice shall be required) following Tenants failure to make any repairs or
perform any work which Tenant is obligated to make or perform under this
Lease, and Landlord shall be allowed to take all material into and upon the
Premises that may be

 



      

 

 



 

required therefor without the same constituting an eviction or constructive
eviction of Tenant in whole or in part. The Base Rent (and any other item of
Rental) shall in no respect abate or be reduced by reason of such repairs,
alterations, improvements or additions, wherever located, or while the same
are being made, by reason of loss or interruption of business of Tenant or
otherwise. Landlord shall promptly repair any damage caused to the Premises or
Tenants Property by such repairs, alterations, improvements or additions. In
all events, Landlord shall use its best efforts not to interfere with or
obstruct Tenants business activities on or in the Premises during any entry.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 15**

 



 

 **CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY**

 



 

Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that use and occupancy of the
Premises for the Permitted Use shall not violate the certificate of occupancy
for the Premises or, to Landlords knowledge, any Requirement. Tenant shall
not at any time, now or hereafter, use or occupy the Premises, directly or
indirectly, in violation of the certificate of occupancy for the Premises, and
in the event that any Governmental Authority hereafter contends or declares by
notice, order or in any other manner whatsoever that the Premises are used for
a purpose that is not included in the Permitted Use and is a violation of such
certificate of occupancy, Tenant shall, upon written Notice from Landlord or
any Governmental Authority, immediately discontinue such use of the Premises.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Premises are altered such that a new
certificate of occupancy is required, then Landlord shall promptly obtain a
new certificate of occupancy and the terms of this Article 15 shall apply to
such new certificate of occupancy.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 16**

 



 

 **DEFAULT**

 



 

 **Section 16.1.** Each of the following events shall be an " ** _Event of
Default_** " under this Lease:

 



 

(a) Tenant shall on any occasion default in the payment when due of any
installment of Base Rent or Additional Rent or of any other item of Rental,
which continues for ten (10) days from and after the date on which Landlord
gives Tenant written Notice specifying such default; provided however,
Landlord shall not be required to give more than one (1) such written notice
for a monetary default per calendar year, and thereafter, the failure of
Tenant to pay any such amount when due shall constitute an Event of Default
without the giving of notice by Landlord.

 



 

(b) Tenant shall commence or institute any case, proceeding or other action
(i) seeking relief for Tenant as a debtor, seeking to adjudicate Tenant a
bankrupt or insolvent or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or other relief with respect
to Tenant or Tenants debts, under any existing or future law of any
jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or relief of debtors or (ii) seeking appointment of a receiver,
trustee, custodian

 



     

 

 



 

or other similar official for Tenant or for all or any substantial part of
Tenants property, and, in each of (i) and (ii) of this clause (b), such
proceeding has not been stayed within sixty (60) days.

 



 

(c) Tenant shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.

 



 

(d) Tenant shall have commenced or instituted against Tenant any case,
proceeding or other action (i) seeking to have an order for relief entered
against Tenant as debtor, seeking to adjudicate Tenant a bankrupt or insolvent
or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, winding-up, liquidation,
dissolution, composition or other relief with respect to Tenant or Tenants
debts, under any existing or future law of any jurisdiction, domestic or
foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of
debtors, or (ii) seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or
other similar official for Tenant or for all or any substantial part of
Tenants property, in each case which (A) results in any such entry of an
order for relief, any such adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency or any
such appointment or the issuance or entry of any other order having a similar
effect or (B) remains undismissed for a period of sixty (60) days.

 



 

(e) Tenant shall have a trustee, receiver or other custodian appointed for any
substantial part of the assets of Tenant, and such appointment shall not be
vacated or effectively stayed within ninety (90) days.

 



 

(f) Tenant shall default in the observance or performance of any other term,
covenant or condition of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant, and
Tenant shall fail (i) to remedy such default within thirty (30) days after
written Notice by Landlord to Tenant of such default or (ii) if such default
is of such a nature that it cannot with due diligence be completely remedied
within such period of thirty (30) days, (A) to duly institute within such
period of thirty (30) days all steps necessary to remedy such default and (B)
to diligently and continuously prosecute thereafter until completion all such
steps.

 



 

 **Section 16.2.** In the event of any breach by Tenant, or any Persons
claiming through or under Tenant, of any term, covenant or condition of this
Lease, Landlord shall have the right to enjoin such breach, in addition to any
other rights, remedies and recourses available to Landlord pursuant to Article
17 or at law or in equity.

 



 

 **Section 16.3.** In the event of any default by Landlord hereunder, then
except as otherwise provided herein, Tenant will give Landlord written Notice
specifying such default with particularity, and Landlord shall thereupon have
thirty (30) days in which (a) to cure such default or (b) if such default
cannot be reasonably cured within such period of thirty (30) days, (i) to
institute within such period of thirty (30) days all steps necessary to cure
such default and (ii) to diligently and continuously prosecute thereafter
until completion all such steps. Unless and until Landlord fails to so cure or
proceed with diligence to cure any default after such notice, Tenant shall not
have any remedy or cause of action by reason thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event of an emergency involving imminent threat to property or
Persons, Tenant shall be required to give only such notice as it may in good
faith deem reasonable under the circumstances.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 16.4.** If Landlord is in default hereunder and fails to cure such
default in accordance with Section 16.3, then, in addition to any and all
other rights, remedies and recourses available to Tenant, Tenant may undertake
to cure such default on behalf of Landlord, at the expense of Landlord, and
all costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by Tenant in curing such default, with interest thereon at the
Applicable Rate, shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant upon demand. In addition
to the foregoing, Tenant shall also have the same rights granted to Landlord
hereunder with respect to injunctive or equitable relief. The right to invoke
the remedies set forth in this Section 16.4 are cumulative and shall not
preclude Tenant from invoking any other remedy allowed at law or in equity.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 17**

 



 

 **REMEDIES AND DAMAGES**

 



 

 **Section 17.1.** If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
Landlord may, at any time thereafter, at Landlords option, give written
Notice to Tenant stating that this Lease and the Term shall terminate on the
date specified in such Notice, which date shall not be less than ten (10) days
after the giving of such Notice, whereupon:

 



 

(a) this Lease and the Term and all rights of Tenant under this Lease shall
automatically terminate as if the date specified in such Notice were the Fixed
Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as applicable;

 



 

(b) Tenant shall quit and peacefully surrender the Premises to Landlord, and
Landlord and its agents may, after the date upon which this Lease and the Term
shall terminate, re-enter the Premises or any part thereof, without Notice,
either by summary proceedings or by any other applicable action or proceeding
or otherwise, and may repossess the Premises and dispossess Tenant and any
other Persons from the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise and remove
any and all of their property and effects from the Premises;

 



 

(c) Landlord, at Landlords option, may relet the whole or any part or parts
of the Premises from time to time, either in the name of Landlord or
otherwise, to such tenant or tenants, for such term or terms ending before, on
or after the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option
Period, as applicable, at such rent or rentals and upon such other conditions,
which may include concessions and free rent periods, as Landlord may
reasonably determine; _provided_ , _however_ , that Landlord shall exercise
reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages related to liability of Tenant
under this Lease; and

 



 

(d) Tenant shall be liable for damages as provided by Section 17.2 or as
provided by law.

 



 

 **Section 17.2.**

 



 

(c) If this Lease and the Term shall terminate as provided by or under any

 



     

 

 



 

summary proceeding or any other action or proceeding, or if Landlord shall re-
enter the Premises as provided in Section 17.1 or by or under any summary
proceeding or any other action or proceeding, then, in any such event Tenant
shall pay to Landlord all Base Rent, Additional Rent and other items of Rental
payable under this Lease by Tenant to Landlord to the date upon which this
Lease and the Term shall have terminated or to the date of re-entry upon the
Premises by Landlord, as the case may be, and:

 



 

(i) Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay to Landlord, as damages, any
deficiency (" ** _Deficiency_** ") between (A) the Rental for the period until
the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as
applicable, and (B) the net amount, if any, of rents collected under any
reletting effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 17.1(c) for any part
of such period (after first deducting from the rents collected under any such
reletting all of Landlords reasonable and actual expenses in connection with
the termination of Tenants right of possession, Landlords re-entry upon the
Premises and such reletting, including all repossession costs, brokerage
commissions, attorneys fees and disbursements, alteration costs and other
expenses of preparing the Premises for such reletting, but only to the extent
such expenses are allocable to the period until the Fixed Expiration Date or
the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as applicable); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) any such Deficiency shall be paid in monthly installments
by Tenant on the days specified in this Lease for payment of installments of
Base Rent and (2) Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant the
Deficiency for each month as the same shall arise, and no suit to collect the
amount of the Deficiency for any month shall prejudice Landlords right to
collect the Deficiency for any subsequent month by a similar proceeding; or

 



 

(ii) if Landlord so elects in writing within sixty (60) days of the Notice of
termination of the Lease, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant,
and Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand, and as and for liquidated and
agreed final damages, an amount equal to the excess of (A) the present value
(calculated using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate) of the unpaid
Rental for the period until the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date
of any Option Period, as applicable _, over_ (B) the present value (calculated
using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate) of the then fair and
reasonable rental value of the Premises for the period until the Fixed
Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option Period, as applicable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, before presentation of proof of such
liquidated damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the Premises or any
part thereof are relet by Landlord on a fair and arms-length basis for the
period until the Fixed Expiration Date or the Expiration Date of any Option
Period, as applicable, or any part of such period, then the amount of rent
reserved upon such reletting shall be deemed, _prima facie_ , to be the fair
and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the Premises so relet
during the term of the reletting.

 



 

(b) Tenant shall in no event be entitled to any rents collected or payable
under any reletting by Landlord in accordance with this Article 17, whether or
not such rents

 



     

 

 



 

exceed the Base Rent reserved in this Lease.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 18**

 



 

 **FEES AND EXPENSES**

shall not have been cured within any applicable cure period, then the non-
defaulting party may (a) perform any term, covenant or condition of this Lease
for the account of the defaulting party or (b) make any expenditure or incur
any obligation for the payment of money in connection with any obligation owed
to the non-defaulting party, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements in instituting, prosecuting or defending any action or

in, at or upon the Premises that may subject any Landlord Indemnitee to any
liability or responsibility for injury, damage to persons or property or to
any liability by reason of the existence or application of, compliance with or

Landlord Indemnitee from and against (a) all claims against any Landlord
Indemnitee arising from any accident, injury or damage whatsoever caused to
any person or to the property of any person and occurring in, on or about the
Premises during the Term or during Tenants occupancy of the Premises except
to the extent caused by the act or omission of Landlord or Persons Within
Landlords Control, and (b) any breach, violation or non-performance of any

harmless agreement shall include indemnity from and against any and all
liability, claims, fines, suits, demands, costs and expenses of any kind or
nature (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in or
in connection with any such claim or proceeding brought thereon and the
defense thereof. If any claim, action or proceeding is made or brought against
any Landlord Indemnitee, against which claim, action or proceeding Tenant is
obligated to indemnify such Landlord Indemnitee pursuant to the terms of this
Lease, then, upon demand by such Landlord Indemnitee, Tenant, at its sole cost
and expense, shall contest or defend such claim, action or proceeding in such
Landlord Indemnitees name, if necessary, by such attorneys as such Landlord
Indemnitee may select, including attorneys for such Landlord Indemnitees
insurer. The provisions of this Section 21.1 shall survive the termination of
this Lease.

 



 

 **Section 21.2.** Landlord shall indemnify and save harmless each Tenant
Indemnitee from and against (a) all claims against any Tenant Indemnitee
arising from any accident, injury or damage whatsoever caused to any person or
the property of any person and occurring in, on or about the Premises during
the Term or during Tenants occupancy of the Premises to the extent caused by
the act or omission of Landlord or Persons Within Landlords Control and (b)
any breach, violation or nonperformance of any covenant, condition or
agreement contained in this Lease to be fulfilled, kept, observed and
performed by Landlord. This indemnity and hold harmless shall include
indemnity from and against any and all liability, claims, fines, suits,
demands, costs and expenses of any kind or nature (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred in or in connection with any such
claim or proceeding brought thereon and the defense thereof. If any claim,
action or proceeding is made or brought against any Tenant Indemnitee, against
which claim, action or proceeding Landlord is obligated to indemnify such
Tenant Indemnitee pursuant to the terms of this Lease, then, upon demand by
the Tenant Indemnitee, Landlord at its sole cost and expense shall contest or
defend such claim, action or proceeding in the Tenant Indemnitees name, if
necessary, by such attorneys as the Tenant Indemnitee may select, including

 **ARTICLE 23**

 



 

 **RENEWAL OPTIONS**

 



 

 **Section 23.1.** So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Tenant shall have two (2) options (each, an " ** _Option_** ") to
renew this Lease for consecutive additional periods of five (5) years (each,
an " ** _Option Period_** ") commencing on the first day after

 



     

 

 



 

the Fixed Expiration Date. As of the first day of each Option Period, Base
Rent for such Option Period shall be adjusted as set forth in the definition
of " ** _Base Rent_** " herein.

 



 

 **Section 23.2.** Tenant may exercise an Option by giving written Notice to
Landlord of Tenants intent to exercise such Option at least one hundred
twenty (120) days prior to the Fixed Expiration Date or the expiration of the
first Option Period, as applicable, failing which Tenant shall be deemed to
have waived the Option for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 23.3.** Tenants right to exercise each Option shall be subject to
the provisions of this Article 23\. In the event that Tenant exercises an
Option, Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that this Lease shall continue in
full force and effect and remain unamended during the applicable Option
Period.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 24**

 



 

 **PURCHASE OPTION**

 



 

 **Section 24.1.** If at any time during the Initial Term or any Option
Period, as applicable, Landlord shall reach substantial agreement on the basic
business terms of a sale of all or any portion of the Premises (the " ** _Sale
Parcel_** ") to a prospective purchaser, then Landlord shall notify Tenant in
writing (the " ** _Purchase Notice_** ") setting forth (i) the size and
location of the Sale Parcel, (ii) the proposed closing date, (iii) the
purchase price, and (iv) all other economic terms upon which Landlord is
prepared to sell the Sale Parcel to the prospective purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 24.2.** Provided Tenant is not in default of the terms hereunder,
Tenant shall have the right of first refusal to purchase the Sale Parcel on
the terms and conditions outlined in the Purchase Notice, which right is
exercisable by written Notice from Tenant to Landlord given within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of the Purchase Notice. If Tenant fails to notify
Landlord that it will purchase the Sale Parcel within such 10 Business Day
period, Tenants right of first refusal shall terminate, and Landlord shall
have no further obligation to the Tenant under this Section 24.2 with respect
to the Sale Parcel; provided, however, that if Landlord, within six (6) months
after the date of Landlords Notice, has not closed on the sale of the Sale
Parcel under terms and conditions which are substantially similar to those set
forth in the applicable Purchase Notice, then Tenants right of first refusal
under this Section 24.2 shall be reinstated and Landlord shall be required to
reissue the Purchase Notice upon expiration of such six (6) month period. If
Tenant shall exercise its right to purchase the Sale Parcel, pursuant to this
Section 24.2, such sale shall be consummated on the terms and conditions
mutually acceptable to both Landlord and Tenant, except to the extent such
terms and conditions conflict with those set forth in the Purchase Notice in
which case the terms in the Purchase Notice shall control.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 25**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 25.1.** The obligations of Landlord under this Lease shall be
binding upon Landlord after any sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer by
Landlord of its interest in the Premises, and in the event of any such sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer, Landlord shall not be freed and relieved
of any of the covenants and obligations of Landlord under this Lease
thereafter arising, unless and until the transferee of Landlords interest in
the Premises shall have assumed, in writing, for the benefit of Tenant, all
obligations of Landlord under this Lease arising after the effective date of
such sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer and Landlord has transferred any
security deposit paid by Tenant to such transferee.

presumption or other rule requiring construction against the party causing
this Lease to be drafted. If any words or phrases in this Lease are stricken

performed after such termination (including, unless expressly otherwise
provided in this Lease, any liability for a payment which shall have accrued
to or with respect to any period ending at the time of such termination and
