canceled pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1.2) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the &#147;<U>Company

Common Stock (a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the

may reasonably specify and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered on the transfer books of the Company, subject to the receipt of
appropriate documentation for such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
(or evidence of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article&nbsp;3, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled; <I>provided that </I>in no event will a holder of
a Certificate be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration if the Merger Consideration was
already paid with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Certificate in
connection with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to such
a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the
