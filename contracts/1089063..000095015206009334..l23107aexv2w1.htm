2\. COMPANY ACTIONS AND SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL 

   

 2.1 _Company Approval_. 

  

 The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) unanimously approved and adopted the "plan of merger" (as such term is used in Section 302A.611 of the 

    ##### 

  

    

MBCA) contained in this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together,
are at a price and on terms that are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, (iii) resolved (subject to
Section 5.1.8 hereof) to recommend that holders of Company Common Stock
adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, (iv) irrevocably taken all necessary steps to cause
Section 302A.673 of the MBCA to be inapplicable to Parent and Subsidiary and
to the Merger and the acquisition of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger and (v) resolved to elect, to the extent of the Boards power and
authority and to the extent permitted by law, not to be subject to any other
"moratorium", "control share acquisition", "business combination", "fair
price" or other form of anti-takeover laws and regulations (collectively, "
_Takeover Laws_ ") of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable
to this Agreement. Piper Jaffray and Co., independent financial advisor to the
Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), has
advised the Companys Board of Directors that, in its opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in the Merger to the Companys shareholders is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such shareholders. 

   

 2.2 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. 

  

 2.2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (such proxy statement, as amended and supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain and furnish the information required to be included by applicable federal securities laws (and the rules and regulations thereunder) in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation with Parent, Subsidiary and their counsel, to respond promptly to any comments received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and promptly cause to be mailed to the Companys shareholders a definitive Proxy Statement, a copy of this Agreement or a summary thereof and a copy of Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (relating to dissenters rights) (the " _MBCA Dissenters  Rights_") and (y) obtain the necessary approval by its shareholders of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. 

   

 2.2.2 The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, as promptly as practicable following the SECs review, if any, of the preliminary Proxy Statement, shall duly call a special meeting of its shareholders (the " _Special Shareholders Meeting_ ") to be held in accordance with the MBCA at the earliest practicable date, upon due notice thereof to its shareholders, to consider and vote upon, among other matters, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger. The Board of Directors will recommend the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and will use its reasonable best efforts, consistent with its fiduciary duties, to solicit the requisite vote of the Companys shareholders to adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, pursuant to the Proxy Statement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.2.3 The Company, Parent and Subsidiary shall cooperate with each other in the Companys preparation of its Proxy Statement. Parent, Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement (and shall provide any comments thereon as soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) business days after being asked to comment) prior to the applicable filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of (i) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (ii) the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ "). The Company shall provide Parent, Subsidiary and their counsel with copies of any written comments or other material communications the Company or its counsel receives from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments or other material communications, and with copies of any written responses to and telephonic notification of any material verbal responses received from the SEC or its staff by the Company or its counsel with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which, to the Companys knowledge (in the case of information provided by the Company) or to Parents knowledge (in the case of information provided by Parent), shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with Parent, to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof.

3\. STATUS AND CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 The manner of converting the shares of the capital stock of the Constituent Corporations and outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and the amount of consideration which the holders of such securities are to receive in exchange for such securities are as follows: 

   

 3.1 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. 

  

 3.1.1 _Subsidiary_. Each share of Subsidiary Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of voting common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (which newly issued shares will be owned by Parent) (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). 

   

 3.1.2 _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to be outstanding, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 3.1.3 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 3.4, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1.2) shall be converted into the right to receive $18.82 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of a certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Article 3, or the right, if so demanded as set forth under Section 3.4 of this Agreement, to receive payment from the Company of the "fair value" of such Company Common Stock as determined in accordance with the MBCA. 

    ##### 

  

     

 3.2 _Exchange of Share Certificates_. 

  

 3.2.1 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause Subsidiary to deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding (and not to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Outstanding Shares_ ") multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. The deposit made by Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 3.2.1 is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for in Section 3.1.3. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. If the Paying Agent invests the Exchange Fund, the Paying Agent shall only invest the Exchange Fund in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. 

   

 3.2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective Time of a certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (such instructions shall include instructions for the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the transfer books of the Company, subject to the receipt of appropriate documentation for such transfer). Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or evidence of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article 3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled; _provided that_ in no event will a holder of a Certificate be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration if the Merger Consideration was already paid with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Certificate in connection with an affidavit of loss. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and the Person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such 

    ##### 

  

    

payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establishes to the satisfaction of Parent and the Company that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit corporations), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act). 

   

 3.2.3 _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2.2. 

   

 3.2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered as of the date immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law, unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 3.2.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond reasonably satisfactory to Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration upon due delivery of such affidavit pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 3.2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under provision of any United States federal, state or local, or non-United States tax law. If Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, then such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company 

    ##### 

  

    

Common Stock in respect of which Parent, Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

   

 3.3 _Company Stock Options, Warrants and Other Stock Plans_. 

  

 3.3.1 _Election Regarding Treatment of Stock Options_. Each Stock Option granted under the Company Option Plans that is outstanding and unexpired immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, with respect to which the Merger Consideration equals or does not exceed the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock for such Stock Option (" _Out-of-The-Money Options_ ") shall be, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, automatically converted into an option to purchase shares of Parents Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") in accordance with Section 3.3.2 below. At least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall notify each holder of options to purchase Company Common Stock that is outstanding under the Company Option Plans as of the Effective Date, whether or not then vested or exercisable, with respect to which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock (" _In-The-Money Options_ ") (the Out-of-The Money Options together with the In-The-Money Options, collectively being the " _Stock Options_ ") of their right to elect to convert their outstanding In-The-Money Options into options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3.2 below or, if vested, cash in accordance with Section 3.3.3 below. Each such holder may so elect by notifying the Company in writing no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date. The failure by any holder of vested In-The-Money Options to provide such notice shall be deemed an election to convert such Stock Option in accordance with Section 3.3.2 below. All Out-Of-The Money Options, all outstanding unvested In-The-Money Options and/or outstanding vested In-The-Money Options with respect to which proper notice to convert under this Section 3.3.1 has been made or no notice has been made will be " _Assumed Options_ " and each will be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.3.2 below. 

   

 3.3.2 _Assumption of Stock Options_. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall take such actions, including (with respect to the Company) any necessary amendment of the Stock Options and the Company Option Plans to permit Parent to assume, and Parent shall assume, at the Effective Time, each Company Option Plan and each of the Assumed Options and substitute shares of Parent Common Stock for the Company Common Stock purchasable under each such assumed Stock Option, which assumption and substitution shall be effected as follows (such actions by the Company shall be done in accordance with the Company Option Plans and stock option agreements under which the grants have been made, including but not limited to the authorization in Sections 9 thereof (and in compliance in all respects with Sections 7 thereof) and the Company shall obtain any other documentation from any holder of the option required as a result of the Assumed Option under the Company Option Plans and stock option agreements under which such grants have been made): 

   

 (a) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable under the Assumed Option shall be equal to 0.386 (the " _Conversion Fraction_ ") times the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Assumed Option (with any fractional amount rounded to the next lowest full share); 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) the per share exercise price of such Assumed Option shall be an amount (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent) equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option being assumed divided by the Conversion Fraction; and 

  

 (c) any other provisions of each Assumed Option shall remain in effect (including acceleration of exercisability resulting from applicable employment or retention agreements); provided, that in the event of any recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other reclassification in respect of Parents outstanding shares of capital stock following the date hereof, there shall be an equitable adjustment with respect hereto. 

  

 3.3.3 _Conversion of In-The-Money Options_. Each outstanding vested In-The-Money Option that will not be treated as an Assumed Option subject to Section 3.3.2 above shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of Company Common Shares for which such vested In-The-Money Option could be exercised as of the Effective Time, and (2) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such vested In-The-Money Option (subject to any applicable withholding taxes). 

   

 3.3.4 _Assumption or Conversion of Warrants_. At least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall notify each holder of warrants exercisable for or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Warrants_ ") of such holders right to elect to convert their Warrants into warrants to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock or cash. Each holder of Warrants may elect to convert such holders outstanding Warrants into warrants to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock or cash by notifying the Company in writing no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date. The failure by any holder to provide such notice shall be deemed an election to convert such Warrants into cash pursuant to Section 3.3.4(a) below. 

   

 (a) Each Warrant that the holder thereof has not elected to convert into a warrant to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and with respect to which the Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock shall, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Warrant and (2) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Warrant (subject to any applicable withholding taxes). Parent shall, prior to the Closing Date, deliver a written instrument to each holder of Warrants who will receive cash in accordance with this Section 3.3.4(a) assuming, on behalf of itself and the Surviving Corporation, the obligation to pay to such holders pursuant to this Section 3.3.4(a). 

  

 (b) Parent, the Company and the Warrant holders shall take such actions, including (with respect to the Company and the Warrant holders) any necessary amendment of the Warrants to permit Parent to assume, and Parent shall assume, at the Effective Time, each Warrant that is not surrendered for cash payment pursuant to Section 3.3.4(a) above (the " _Assumed Warrants_ "), and substitute shares of Parent Common Stock for the Company 

   ##### 

  

 

Common Stock purchasable under each Assumed Warrant, which assumption and
substitution shall be effected as follows: 

   

 (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable under the Assumed Warrant shall be equal to the Conversion Fraction times the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Assumed Warrant (with any fractional amount rounded to the next lowest full share); 

  

 (ii) the per share exercise price of the Assumed Warrant shall be an amount (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent) equal to the per share exercise price of the Warrant being assumed divided by the Conversion Fraction; and 

  

 (iii) subject to applicable law and the Parents existing contractual commitments, any other provisions of each Assumed Warrant shall remain in effect. 

  

 (c) Following the date of this Agreement, but as a condition precedent to Parent assuming the Assumed Warrants, the Company will solicit from each holder of an Assumed Warrant confirmation that such holder is an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act. Should any such holder not qualify as an "accredited investor", Parent and such holder will take commercially reasonable actions so that the conversion of the Assumed Warrant complies with applicable Law. 

  

3.4 _Dissenters and Appraisal Rights_. 

   

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1.2), the holder of which has demanded and perfected such holders right to dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make all payments to holders of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to such demands in accordance with the MBCA. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair value for any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to conduct jointly all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock under the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by Law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for shares of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Such plans or other arrangements are collectively referred to herein as " _Company Benefit Plans_." Copies of all Company Benefit Plans and related documents, including those setting out the Companys personnel policies and procedures, and including any insurance contracts, trust agreements or other arrangements under which benefits are provided, as currently in effect, and descriptions of any such plan which are not written have been made available for inspection by Parent.

 (d) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter for each employee pension benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, listed in Section 4.1.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter, determining that such plan is a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code and is exempt from United States federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and the Company has no knowledge of any occurrence since the date of any such determination letter which has adversely affected such qualification. The Company does not maintain a plan or arrangement intended to qualify under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (e) Neither the Company nor any entity that is treated as a single employer with the Company pursuant to Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (" _Company_ _ERISA Affiliate_ ") currently maintains, contributes to or has any liability with respect to any employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor has previously maintained or contributed to any such plan that has resulted in any liability or potential liability for the Company under said Title IV. 

  

 (f) The Company does not maintain any Company Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement medical benefits (other than benefits which are required by Law), post-employment benefits, death benefits or other post-retirement welfare benefits.

 (g) Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate maintains, nor has contributed since January 1, 2001 to any multiemployer plan within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.

There is no pending dispute between any such employer and any multiemployer plan concerning payment of contributions or payment of withdrawal liability payments. 

  

 (h) All Company Benefit Plans have been operated and administered in accordance with their respective terms in all material respects and no inconsistent representation or interpretation has been made to any plan participant. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) No Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company covers or otherwise benefits any individuals other than current or former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (and their dependents and beneficiaries). 

  

 (j) Each Company Benefit Plan may be amended and terminated in accordance with its terms, and, each such plan provides for the unrestricted right of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (as applicable) to amend or terminate such Plan. 

  

 (k) The Company and its subsidiaries have no material liability for, under, with respect to or otherwise in connection with any employee benefit plan, which liability arises under ERISA or the Code, by virtue of the Company or any subsidiary being aggregated, with any other person that is a Company ERISA Affiliate, in a controlled group or affiliated service group for purposes of ERISA or the Code. 

  

 (l) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment) (i) result in any material payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) from the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material benefits, except as otherwise required by applicable law.

Company Material Adverse Effect. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the current taxable period did not, as of the most recent

(disregarding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the

of the Code) with respect to a transaction described in Section 355 of the

excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium, withholding, alternative or

and each of its subsidiaries either own, or have valid leasehold interests
in, all properties and assets used by them in the conduct of their business,

Effect.
