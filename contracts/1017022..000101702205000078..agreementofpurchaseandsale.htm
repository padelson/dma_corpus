Buyer  recognizes that the Hotels and Personal Property are not new and that
there  exists a possibility that the Property is not in compliance with the 
requirements which would be imposed on a newly constructed hotel by
presently  effective federal, state and local building, plumbing, electrical,
fire, health,  handicap, environmental and life safety laws, codes,
ordinances, rules, orders  and/or regulations (collectively, the "
_building  codes_ ").  The  Hotels and other improvements on the Land may
contain substances or materials  no  longer permitted to be used in newly
constructed buildings including, without  limitation, asbestos or other
insulation materials, lead or other paints,  wiring, electrical, or plumbing
materials and may not contain other materials  or  equipment required to be
installed in a newly constructed building. Buyer has  had the opportunity, as
set forth in Section 11.04, to conduct such  investigations and inspections
of the Property as Buyer deemed necessary with  respect to all such matters.
Buyer agrees to accept and shall accept the  Property in an "AS-IS, WHERE IS"
condition and at Closing to accept and assume  the risk of noncompliance of
the Property with all such building codes. Buyer  waives any right to excuse
or delay performance of its obligations under this  Agreement or to assert
any claim against Sellers (before or after Closing)  arising out of any
failure of the Property to comply with any such building  codes.

do not  make, and shall not be deemed to have made, any representation,
warranty or  covenant with respect to (i) any Environmental Laws that may
affect any of  the  Property or (ii) the presence or absence of any
Hazardous or Toxic Substances  in, on, above, under or about any of the
Property. As used in this Section  7.05,  (A) the term " _Environmental 
Laws_ "  means  all federal, State and local laws, codes, ordinances, rules,
orders and  regulations now or hereafter in effect relating to pollution or
the protection  of the environment, including without limitation, all laws,
codes, ordinances,  rules, orders and regulations governing the generation,
use, collection,  treatment, storage, transportation, recovery, removal,
discharge, spill or  disposal of any or all Hazardous or Toxic Substances,
and (B) the term "Hazardous Substances" or "Toxic Substances" means materials
and substances  defined as "hazardous substances", "hazardous wastes", "toxic
substances" or "toxic wastes" in (I) the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and  Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. Sections
9601-9675, as amended by the Superfund  Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1988, and any further amendments thereto  and rules, orders and regulations
thereunder; (II) the Resource Conservation  and  Recovery Act of 1976, 42

_Section  8.01_ _Sellers '  Remedies_.»

 

 

If  Buyer  defaults under any provision of this Agreement before the
Closing, Buyer and  Sellers agree that the damages that Sellers will sustain
as a result thereof  will be substantial, but the actual damages will be
difficult or impossible  to  ascertain. Accordingly, Buyer and Sellers agree
that, in the event of Buyer's  default, Sellers may, as their sole and
exclusive remedies, terminate this  Agreement by written notice to Buyer in
which event Sellers shall receive the  Deposit as liquidated damages for such
default, the amount of which Deposit  Buyer and Sellers agree is not punitive
or a penalty but is just, fair and  reasonable, and the Escrow Agent shall
immediately pay the Deposit to  Sellers.

 

 

_Section  8.02_ _Buyer 's  Remedies_.»

 

 

In  the  event of a default hereunder on the part of any Seller before
Closing, or if  there shall be an inaccuracy or breach of any representation
or warranty  contained (or deemed contained) in Article VI of this Agreement
made as of  the  Effective Date or as of the Closing Date as if then made,
Buyer's sole and  exclusive remedies hereunder shall be either: (1) the right
to terminate this  Agreement and receive a return of the full amount of the
Deposit, plus interest  thereon, or (2) the right to seek specific
performance hereof, provided that  Buyer must file a suit for specific
performance in the appropriate jurisdiction  within ninety (90) days from the
date of such default by such  Seller.

 

 

The  parties waive all damages and remedies for defaults prior to Closing
except  as  provided in this Agreement. Following Closing, RFS Partnership,
L.P., shall  be  liable for obligations of Wharf Associates that survive
Closing pursuant to  the  terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that,
following Closing, Wharf  Associates shall only be liable for its own
obligations that survive Closing  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
shall not be liable for the  obligations of RFS Partnership, L.P., or any
other Seller. All Sellers shall  be  jointly and severally liable for any
and all obligations of any Seller or all  Sellers under this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

_Section  8.03_ _Post-Closing  Matters_.»

 

 

Notwithstanding  the terms and provisions of Sections 8.01 and 8.02 or any
other term or  provision of this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer shall each
retain the right  to  seek and obtain relief for events occurring, or the
breach of any representation  and warranty discovered, after the Closing Date
provided that: (a) this  transaction in fact closes; (b) the obligations for
which relief is sought  are  obligations which by their express terms are to
survive Closing or which by  their express terms are to performed following
Closing (including any  indemnities hereunder, if any); and (c) such relief
shall be limited to a suit  for monetary damages, unless expressly otherwise
provided in this Agreement.  Except for obligations which by their express
terms are to survive Closing  or  which by their express terms are to be
performed following Closing, the terms  and provisions of this Agreement
shall not survive the Closing and shall merge  into the Deeds from Sellers to
Buyer. The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall  survive Closing.

remedy shall be to either (i) terminate this  Agreement by written notice to
Sellers given on or before the Closing Date  without recourse against Sellers

_Section  14.10_ _Section  Headings; Interpretation_.»

 

 

The  section headings of this Agreement are for reference only and shall not
be  used  to construe or interpret this Agreement. All terms and words used
in this  Agreement, regardless of the number or gender in which they are
used, shall  be  deemed to include any other number and any other gender as
the context may  require. If any term or condition of this Agreement or the
application thereof  to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be
held legally invalid  or  unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement,
and the application of such  terms or conditions to persons or circumstances
other than those as to which  it  is held legally invalid or unenforceable,
shall not be affected thereby and  each  term and condition of this
Agreement shall be valid to the fullest extent  permitted by law.

 

 

_Section  14.11_ _Governing  Law_.»

 

 

This  Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Florida;
provided,  however, that with respect to matters that relate to a specific

_Section  14.12_ _Disclosure  of Confidential Information/ Public
Announcements/ Communication with  Governmental Authorities/ Communication
with Employees_. »

 

 



 

 

(a) The  parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the existence of this
Agreement,  the  terms of this Agreement and any other information disclosed
in the due diligence  materials delivered to or produced by Buyer or any
other documents, materials,  data or other information with respect to the
Property which is not generally  known to the public (the " _Confidential 
Information_ ")  shall  in all respects remain confidential and shall not be
disclosed by the Buyer  except as provided herein. Buyer may disclose
Confidential Information to  officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, lenders,  financial advisors, partners, investors
prospective tenants and purchasers  (collectively, " _Representatives_ "), 
who  in the reasonable business judgment of such party, need to know the
Confidential  Information for the purpose of evaluating the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement, or in connection with any litigation
between Buyer and Sellers  arising under the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer will inform  its Representatives of its confidentiality
obligations under this Agreement,  and  such Representatives shall agree to
be bound by the terms and conditions of  this  Agreement, before Buyer may
disclose any Confidential Information to its  Representatives; provided,
however, any such prospective tenants and purchasers  shall not have a right
or license to access or inspect the Property or to  contact the Manager or
any of the Hotel employees. The disclosure of any  Confidential Information
by any Representative in breach of this Agreement  will  constitute a breach
of this Agreement by Buyer, for which Buyer will be liable.  If Buyer or any
of its Representatives is required by any subpoena,  interrogatories, request
for production, or other legal process or by any  applicable law or
regulation to disclose any Confidential Information, Buyer  will give (to the
extent not prohibited by law) Sellers prompt written notice  of  the
requirement and will cooperate with the Sellers so that Sellers, at their 
expense, may seek an appropriate protective order. In the absence of a 
protective order, Buyer and its Representatives may disclose only such 
Confidential Information as may in Buyer\'s reasonable opinion, be necessary 
to  avoid any penalty, sanction, or other material adverse consequence, and
Buyer  will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure confidential
treatment of  any  Confidential Information so disclosed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, any party hereto shall have the right to
make a public  announcement regarding the transaction described in this
Agreement, provided,  however, that, prior to and as a condition precedent to
such public  announcement, all other parties hereto shall approve the timing,
form and  substance of any such public announcement, except if a party hereto
is required  to make a public announcement under any securities law, the
party making such  public announcement may do so only after having provided
the other party with  a  copy of such public announcement and only as long
as such public announcement  is  made in strict accordance with the
applicable law requiring such public  announcement be made. Any public
announcement made on the Effective Date (or  the  next business day) shall
have been agreed to by the parties as to its form  and  content prior to the
parties executing this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting the generality of the provisions in subsection (a)
above, Buyer shall  not, through its officers, employees, managers,
contractors, consultants,  agents, representatives or any other person
(including, without limitation,  Buyer's third party consultants), directly
or indirectly, communicate with any  governmental authority or any official,
employee or representative thereof,  involving any matter with respect to the
Property without the Sellers' prior  written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, unless such  communication is arranged by the
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer  and its representatives and
consultants shall have the right to review building  department, health
department and other local governmental authority records  with respect to
the Property and the operation of the Hotels and request written  or verbal
confirmation of zoning and any other compliance by the Land or Hotels  with
any applicable laws, without any requirement to obtain the consent of  the 
Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to 
communicate with the applicable governmental authority in connection with
the  issuance of any liquor licenses required for the sale of liquor at the
Hotels,  and any and all other permits or licenses required to be transferred
or applied  for in connection with the sale of the Hotels, all without the
prior consent  of  the Sellers; provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall
provide Sellers with  regular updates regarding the progress of any and all
such communications;  and  (ii) no inspections of the Hotels by the
applicable governmental authorities  shall occur unless a representative of
the Sellers is present during such  inspections.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Communication  with Employees. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions in subsection  (a) above, Buyer shall not, through its officers,
employees, managers,  contractors, consultants, agents, representatives or
any other person  (including, without limitation, Buyer's third party
consultants), directly or  indirectly, communicate with any Employees or any
person representing any  Employees involving any matter with respect to the
Property, the Employees  or  this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Sellers and Managers,  which  consent may be withheld in the sole
discretion of Sellers and Managers, unless  such communication is arranged by
the Sellers and/or Managers. Buyer shall  not,  through its officers,
employees, managers, contractors, consultants, agents,  representatives or
any other person (including, without limitation, Buyer's  third party
consultants), cause Sellers to be in violation of any Management  Agreement
with respect to contact or communication with any Employees.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with  Buyer  in order
to arrange communications, pursuant to a schedule to be reasonably  agreed
upon by the parties in order to allow Buyer to interview the Employees  for
possible continued employment, and Buyer shall apprise the Sellers from 
time  to time as to its plans for communicating with such Employees, and to
complete  such communications in advance of the Closing.

reasonable efforts to cause the Managers to deliver,  on  or prior to the
Closing Date, a complete list of (i) all gift certificates  issued with
respect to the Property that are outstanding as of the Closing  Date  and
(ii) all bookings and reservations for guest, conference, meeting and 
banquet rooms or other facilities at the Property that are outstanding as of 
the  Closing Date.

 

 

_Section  14.14_ _Non-Solicitation_.»

 

 

After  the  Closing, Sellers and their affiliates shall not solicit for
employment any  employees of any of the Hotels to which Buyer (or its
manager(s)) has offered  employment contemporaneously with the Closing;
provided, however, a general  solicitation by Sellers or any of their
affiliates of any such employees for  employment with Sellers made in
connection with a specific market or  industry-wide solicitation for
employment shall not be a violation of this  Section 14.13.

 

 

_Section  14.15_ _Mutual  Indemnity for Third Party Personal Injury and
Property Damage  Claims_.

 

 

(a) _Sellers_ _'   Indemnity_.  Sellers  agree to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer of and from all liabilities,  losses, damages, costs or
expenses (including, without limitation, court costs  and reasonable
attorneys' fees) which Buyer may suffer or incur by reason of any  act
occurring, or cause of action accruing, on or prior to the Closing Date 
and  arising from any personal injury or property damage suffered by any
third party  at or on the Property on or prior to the Closing Date,
including, without  limitation, any claims by employees of any of the
Sellers, Operating Tenants  or  Managers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Buyer 's  Indemnity_.  Buyer  agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers of and from all  liabilities, losses, damages, costs or
expenses (including, without limitation,  court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees) which Sellers may suffer or incur by  reason of any act
occurring, or cause of action accruing, after the Closing  Date  and arising
from any personal injury or property damage suffered by any third  party at
or on the Property after the Closing Date, including, without  limitation,
any claims by employees of Buyer.

 

 

_Section  14.16_ _Time  of Essence_.»

 

 

Time  is  of the essence of this Agreement and each term and provision
hereof; provided,  however (unless specifically provided to the contrary
elsewhere in this  Agreement), when the date by which any action, event or
condition is to occur  or  any notice or other communication is to be given
falls on a Saturday, Sunday  or  legal holiday, the date by which such
action, event or condition is to occur  or  such notice or other

Re:  Hilton  Fisherman's Wharf

 

Outside  of a possible EEOC charge filed by the previous Sales
Administrator  for  discrimination (property was told that the information
was filed,  but it  would be sent to the proper State/Federal Office for
review and  determination as to whether it would go any further), and the
two  grievances the property has with the Servers that were let go due  to 
theft, there are no further legal matters.
