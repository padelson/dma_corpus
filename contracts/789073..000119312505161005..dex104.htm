cause whatsoever except as provided in this Agreement or in a specific waiver
or release by the Purchaser in writing and any such waiver or release shall
not prejudice or affect any remaining rights or remedies of the Purchaser.

   12. | LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY 
---|--- 



Disclosure



   12.1 | The Vendor shall not be liable in respect of a Claim to the
extent that the facts and circumstances giving rise to the Claim are fairly
disclosed in the Disclosure Letter.  
---|--- 



   12.2 | The Vendors liability in respect of a Claim for breach of the
Warranties shall be limited by the provisions of this clause 12. Without
prejudice to this clause 12, for the avoidance of doubt such liability of the
Vendor shall not be limited as a result of the disclosure of additional facts
and circumstances after the date of this Agreement or matters of which the
Purchaser became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) after the
date of this Agreement. 
---|--- 



Notification of Claims and time limits



   12.3 | The Vendor shall not be liable for any General Claim unless the
Purchaser gives to the Vendor written notice containing a summary of the
nature of the General Claim as far as is known to the Purchaser, on or before
the date being the date of the expiry of the third month following the end of
the financial year of the Purchaser ending 31 December 2006, except for those
matters having a legal prescription period greater than such period, in which
case the period shall be deemed to be extended until the lapse of the relevant
legal prescription period. The Vendor shall not be liable for any Tax Warranty
Claim unless the Purchaser gives written notice containing a summary of the
nature of the Tax Warranty Claim as far as it is known to the Purchaser to the
Vendor on or before the date being four years from Completion. 
---|--- 



   12.4 | A Claim shall not be enforceable against the Vendor and shall be
deemed to have been withdrawn unless legal proceedings in respect of such
Claim are commenced (by being issued and served) within nine months of
service of notice of the Claim on the Vendor. 
---|--- 



Monetary Limits __



   12.5 | The liability of the Vendor in respect of the aggregate of all
Claims (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any claim which has arisen as a
result of fraud) shall not exceed the Purchase Price _._ 
---|--- 



 

20 unless the amount of the liability of the Vendor in respect of all Claims
exceeds 2,000,000 in which case the Vendor shall be liable for the full
amount of the Claims not just the excess. 
---|--- 



   12.7 | The Vendor shall have no liability in respect of any Claim
unless the Claim (or the aggregate of a series of connected Claims or Claims
arising out of similar facts or circumstances) exceeds 100,000 in which case
the Vendor shall be liable for the full amount of the Claim not just the
excess. 
---|--- 



Sums recoverable from third parties



   12.8 | Where the Purchaser is entitled to recover from any person
(other than in respect of a policy of insurance) any sum in respect of any
matter or event which gives rise to a Claim, the Purchaser shall use its
reasonable endeavours to recover that sum and shall keep the Vendor informed
of the conduct of such recovery. The Purchaser shall not be restricted from
pursuing that or any other Claim in relation to the same subject matter
against the Vendor. Any sum recovered by the Purchaser before settlement or
final determination of the Claim (less any costs and expenses incurred by the
Purchaser in recovering the sum and any Taxation attributable to or suffered
in respect of the sum recovered) will reduce the amount of the Claim for
which the Vendor is liable by an equivalent amount. If recovery is delayed
until after the Claim has been satisfied by the Vendor, the Purchaser shall
(subject to the remaining provisions of this clause) repay to the Vendor the
amount so recovered (less any costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser
and/or a member of the Fortune Brands Group in recovering the sum and any
Taxation attributable to or suffered in respect of the sum recovered). If the
amount so recovered exceeds the amount of the Claim satisfied by the Vendor
the Purchaser shall be entitled to retain the excess. 
---|--- 



Actions by third parties

---|--- 



     | 12.9.1 | the Purchaser shall, as soon as practicable, notify the
Vendor giving reasonable details, so far as are known to the Purchaser, of the
relevant facts and circumstances relating to the Third Party Claim and a
reasonable estimate of the amount likely to be claimed in respect of it to the
extent the Purchaser has any knowledge of such amount; 
---|---|--- 



     | 12.9.2 | the Purchaser shall keep the Vendor informed of all
material developments in relation to the Third Party Claim within its
knowledge and within a reasonable time after so becoming aware, provided that
the Purchaser will not be under any obligation to provide the Vendor with any
information which is or may be privileged in the context of the Third Party
Claim; 
---|---|---

Purchaser shall give the Vendor and its professional advisers reasonable
access to such relevant chattels, accounts, documents and records within the
power or control of the Purchaser as the Vendor may reasonably request in
relation to a Third Party Claim;

or expenses which may be reasonably incurred, take such action as the Vendor

after the date of this Agreement with retrospective effect; and

increased, wholly or partly as a result of any change in any enactment, law,
regulation, directive or practice of any government, government department or
agency or a regulatory body (including extra statutory concessions of the
Inland Revenue or the Spanish tax administrations or Spanish customs
authorities) made after the date of this Agreement whether or not having
retrospective effect.

actions be taken and certain documents be produced for the purposes of
effecting and/or registering a transfer of Intellectual Property Rights,
files containing Personal Data and/or domain names with public authorities, or
otherwise and the Parties agree to co-operate in good faith to ensure that

enforce the terms contained in clause 11.4 and of any nominee of Fortune
Brands appointed in accordance with clause 3.2 to enforce all the terms of
this Agreement (together such persons being referred to as the "Third
