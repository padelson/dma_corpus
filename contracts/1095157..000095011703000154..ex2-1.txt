DATE:                      JANUARY 20, 2003

                                   BACKGROUND

     A. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms
and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     B. It is proposed that Acquisition Sub make a cash tender offer (the
"Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $.01 par
value per share of the Company ("Company Common Stock") for $9.00 per share
(such amount, or any greater per share amount paid pursuant to the Offer,
subject to Section 1.1(e), being the "Per Share Amount"), upon the terms and
provisions of and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

     C. In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the
respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have
each approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub with and into the
Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, upon the terms and
provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     D. By resolutions duly adopted, the board of directors of the Company has,
in light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof: (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders; and (ii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the Offer and tender their shares pursuant to the Offer and adopt
this Agreement.

     E. In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement certain of the stockholders,
executive officers and directors of the









<PAGE>


Company set forth on Exhibit B hereto are executing a tender and voting
agreement in favor of Parent and Acquisition Sub (the "Tender and Voting
Agreement").

     F. Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in
Exhibit A hereto.

     INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, in consideration of the mutual agreements
contained herein and subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                              Section 1: THE OFFER

     1.1 Conduct of the Offer.

         (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8 hereof and that none of the events or circumstances
set forth in Annex I shall have occurred or exist (excluding the events or
circumstances set forth in paragraph "(a)" in Annex I), as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not later than ten (10) business days after the
date of this Agreement, provided that the Company has, within a reasonable time
prior theretofore, provided Parent with the information about the Company
required to be included in the Offer Statement (defined below)), Acquisition Sub
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer.

         (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is
permitted to do so under applicable Law and shall pay for such shares promptly
thereafter (and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act). The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject
to (i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn a
number of shares of Company Common Stock that (including the shares tendered
under the Tender and Voting Agreement) immediately prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer ("Parent-Owned
Shares"), represents at least a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of Company
Shares (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other conditions set forth in
Annex I. Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right at its sole discretion to
increase the initial Per Share Amount, to waive (in whole or in part) any of the
conditions of the offer set forth in Annex I or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; provided that without the prior written
consent of the Company: (i) the Minimum Condition may not be amended or waived;
(ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid,
that reduces the Per Share Amount or that changes the number of shares of
Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, or imposes conditions to the Offer in
addition to the Minimum Condition and the conditions set forth in Annex I; (iii)
except as provided in Section 1.1(c), no change may be made that extends the
expiration date of the Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer,
and (iv) no change may be made that amends any other terms of the Offer in a
manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock. Simultaneously with
the acceptance for payment of any shares in the Offer, Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to deposit with the Paying Agent immediately available cash
funds sufficient to pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

         (c) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire 20 business days
following the date of the commencement thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the parties' respective
termination rights under Section 8.1, (i) if,





                                       2






<PAGE>



at any then-scheduled expiration date, any of the conditions to the Offer have
not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to extend the
Offer for such amount of time as is reasonably necessary to cause such
conditions to the Offer to be satisfied; (ii) Acquisition Sub may, without the
consent of the Company or any other Person (A) extend the Offer (one or more
times) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC applicable to the Offer and (B) if the sum of (1) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that shall have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (other than shares tendered by guaranteed
delivery where actual delivery has not occurred) as of the scheduled or extended
expiration date of the Offer, plus (2) the number of Parent-Owned Shares as of
such date, represents more than a majority of the Fully Diluted Number of
Company Shares but less than 90% of the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares
as of such date, extend the Offer (one or more times) for an aggregate
additional period of not more than 20 business days; (iii) Acquisition Sub may,
without the consent of the Company or any other Person, elect to provide for a
subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) pursuant to, and
in accordance with the terms of, Rule 14d under the Exchange Act; and (iv) if,
at any then-scheduled expiration date any of the conditions to the Offer have
not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub shall, if the Company so requests
in writing, extend the Offer for 10 business days.

         (d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference the offer to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Offer
Statement") and form of the related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the
Offer Statement and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with applicable federal securities laws.
Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that they shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which
together constitute the "Offer Documents") to comply in all material respects
with the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer and to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as supplemented or amended to correct
such information to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent
and Acquisition Sub all information concerning the Acquired Companies and the
Company's stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(d). The Company and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents (including any amendment thereto) prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to provide the Company and its
counsel with any comments Parent, Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments.

         (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction,





                                       3






<PAGE>


then the Per Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change
or transaction.

     1.2 Company Actions.

         (a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and
represents that its board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has
by the unanimous vote of all directors of the Company (i) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), (iii) declared
that this Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to recommend that stockholders
of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent necessary under applicable law to
accomplish the Merger, adopt this Agreement (the recommendation of the Company's
board of directors that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this
Agreement being referred to as the "Company Board Recommendation"), and (v) to
the extent necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the
Company not to be subject to any state takeover law or similar Law, including,
without limitation, Section 203 of the DGCL, that might otherwise apply to the
Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3: (A) the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents; and (B)
the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner
adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, and no resolution by the board of
directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub
shall be adopted or proposed.

         (b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced,
the Company shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the
dissemination of the Offer Statement and related documents) disseminate to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect,
subject to Section 5.3, the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees
that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material respects with
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable
Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 as supplemented or amended to correct such information
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments.

         (c) The Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to, promptly
furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub with a list of its stockholders, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and
addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of
securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock




                                       4

held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date, and will provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent or Acquisition Sub may reasonably
request in connection with the Offer and the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Sub
and their agents shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files, will use such information only in connection with
the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon
request, deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies
and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession or
control.

     1.3 Directors.

         (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company's board
of directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company's board of directors (giving effect to the election of any additional
directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by
Parent or Acquisition Sub (including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer), and whose denominator is the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to cause Parent's designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company's board of directors, including increasing
the number of directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent
directors. At such time, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company will
also use all commercially reasonable actions to cause individuals designated by
Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number,
on (i) each committee of the Company's board of directors and (ii) each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that
represents the same percentage as individuals designated by Parent represent on
the board of directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause at least two of the members of the Company's board
of directors, at all times prior to the Effective Time, to be individuals who
were directors of the Company and were not officers or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the "Continuing Directors");
provided, however, that if at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall
be in office only one Continuing Director for any reason, the Company's board of
directors shall cause a person who is not an officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries designated by the remaining Continuing Director to
fill such vacancy (and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for all purposes of this Agreement), and if at any time prior to the Effective
Time no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company
then in office shall use reasonable efforts to designate two persons to fill
such vacancies who are not officers or employees or affiliates of the Company,
its Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
affiliates (and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all
purposes of this Agreement).

         (b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the
Company's board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect
to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill its obligations under this
Section, so long as Parent shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis
the




                                       5






<PAGE>


information with respect to Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The
provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights
which Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable law
with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

         (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a
majority of the Continuing Directors or if there shall only be one, of a
Continuing Director, shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company's board of directors and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other
director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company's board of directors, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition Sub requiring the
consent of the Company, any waiver of compliance by the Company of any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company or its
stockholders, any required or permitted consent or action by the board of
directors of the Company hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder
which adversely affects the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent or Acquisition Sub); provided, that, if for any reason there shall
be no Continuing Directors and the Company has used commercially reasonable
efforts to appoint Continuing Directors but has been unable after a reasonable
period of time to find suitable candidates willing to serve, such actions may be
effected by majority vote of the entire board of directors of the Company.

                         Section 2: MERGER TRANSACTION

     2.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL,

     2.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in

York City time, on a date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which
shall be no later than the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver
of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Section 7
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the
delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the
Closing), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of
merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed
by the Company and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the
Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the State

filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later time as is specified in the certificate of merger
(the "Effective Time").

     2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

         (a) subject to Section 6.5(a), the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to

immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable law;

         (b) subject to Section 6.5(a), the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation

         (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of
Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be; and

         (d) the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, as the case may be.

     2.5 Conversion of Shares.

         (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:

              (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company or
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the Company's treasury)
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

              (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock, if any, then held by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor;

              (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and
subject to Sections 2.5(b), 2.5(c) and 2.7, each share of Company Common Stock
then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Amount (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest; and

              (iv) each of the shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of Acquisition Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of
Company Common Stock.

         (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of




                                       7






<PAGE>


shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change or transaction.

         (c) If, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company or under which the
Company has any rights, then the Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition. The Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled
to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

     2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying
Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds
to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5.
Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such
earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

         (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the "Certificates")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such
Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company
Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.6(b), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of




                                       8






<PAGE>


the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond
(in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate.

         (c) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not
disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall
be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect
to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share
of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
other similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any amounts payable
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

         (d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable Law.

         (e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

     2.7 Shares Subject to Appraisal Rights.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, to the extent that the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL are or,
prior to the Effective Time become, applicable to the Merger, any shares of
Company Common Stock that, as of the Effective Time, are held by holders who
have as of the Effective Time preserved appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to such shares shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5(a),
and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights
as may be provided to such holder or holders pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL; provided, however, that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or
the holders of such shares shall otherwise lose their appraisal rights with
respect to such shares, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the




                                       9






<PAGE>


time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such rights, such
shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right
to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
such shares) the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5(a).

         (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the
Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer
prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall
have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer.

     2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Acquisition Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition
Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

            Section 3: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company

except to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document has
been revised or superseded by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

                                       12






<PAGE>


complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) when filed, were prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial

footnotes and are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments), and
(iii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial

affiliate, officer, director,


                                       30




<PAGE>


manager or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative (collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish

properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other action
to facilitate the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement nothing contained in this Section 5.3 or any other
provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company's board of directors
from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with respect
to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that Company may not, except as
permitted by Section 5.3(b), withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or
modify, the Company Board Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Company will immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of acceptance of
Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company may furnish
information concerning its businesses or its Subsidiaries, properties or assets
to any Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder) and may negotiate and participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person or group concerning a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), provided that such Person or group shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement, the confidentiality provisions of which shall not be
materially more favorable to such third party than those provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality agreement must
permit the Company to disclose to Parent all of the information required to be
disclosed by the Company to Parent by this Section 5.3) if:

              (x) such Person or group has submitted a Superior Proposal;

              (y) in the good faith opinion of the Company's board of directors,
     determined only after consulting with independent legal counsel to the
     Company, the failure to do so would result in a breach of the board's
     fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law; and

              (z) the Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention to
     engage in such discussions or negotiations or to provide such confidential
     information not less than the 24 hours prior to so doing.

     The Company will promptly (but in no case later than 24 hours after receipt
thereof) notify Parent in writing of the existence of any proposal, discussion,
negotiation or inquiry received by the Company regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, and the Company will immediately communicate to Parent the material
terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry that it may receive
regarding any Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the party making such
proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or negotiation. The Company
will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company provided to any other Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
which was not previously provided to Parent. The Company will keep Parent
informed on a prompt basis of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal and of any amendments or proposed amendments to any


                                       31




<PAGE>


Acquisition Proposal and of the status of any discussions or negotiations
relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

         (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.3(b), neither the board of
directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify,
or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
that is entered into in accordance with Section 5.3(a)). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.3, prior
to the time of acceptance for payment of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, the Company's board of directors, after consulting with independent legal
counsel, may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, approve or
recommend a Superior Proposal, or enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, if the board determines in good faith that the failure to
take such action would result in a breach of the board's fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable law, provided that in each case the
Company has given Parent written notice at least three business days in advance
of such action that the board of directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal that it intends to accept, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal.

         (c) Nothing in this Section 5.3, and no action taken by the board of
directors of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3, will (i) permit the
Company to enter into any agreement providing for any transaction contemplated
by an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement to the extent
permitted under Section 5.3 hereof) for as long as this Agreement remains in
effect or (ii) affect in any manner any other obligation of the Company under
this Agreement.

         (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
bona fide offer, proposal or other indication of interest regarding any of the
following (other than the transactions provided for in this Agreement involving
the Company): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer
or other disposition of all or a significant portion of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including, without limitation,
any license, lease or other transfer or disposition of all or a significant
portion of the Software and Intangibles of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related transactions;
(iii) any purchase of or tender offer or exchange offer for 10% percent or more
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or the filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv)
any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal on
terms which the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith,
taking into consideration such matters that it deems relevant (including,
without limitation, the additional time necessary to consummate the Acquisition
Proposal), to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Offer and
the Merger (based on advice of the Company's independent financial advisor that
the value of the consideration provided for in such proposal is superior to the
value of the consideration provided for in the Offer), for which financing, to
the extent required, is (based upon the advice of the Company's independent
financial advisor) reasonably capable of being obtained; provided, however, that
for purposes of this definition, "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to refer
only to a transaction involving a majority of the


                                       32




<PAGE>


outstanding voting securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company.

         (e) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any
Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired
Companies is a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies has any
rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each
such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also will promptly request
each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal or equity investment to return
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of any of the Acquired Companies.

     5.4 Certain Resolutions. The board of directors of the Company or the
compensation committee thereof shall pass any necessary resolutions as soon as
practicable after the date hereof to provide for the treatment of Company
Options as set forth in Section 6.3 of this Agreement.

                 Section 6: ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

     6.1 Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement.

         (a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
required by applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
following the date the Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment shares of
Company Common Stock, take all action necessary under all applicable Law to
call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock
to vote on the adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting").
The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable
Law.

         (b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders is
required by Law, the Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date
the Acquisition Sub shall accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock,
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and shall use all reasonable
efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders, as promptly as
practicable. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
give Parent an opportunity to comment on any correspondence with the SEC or its
staff or any proposed material to be included in the Proxy Statement prior to
transmission to the SEC or its staff and shall not transmit any such material to
which Parent reasonably objects. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders' Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly
prepare such an amendment or supplement and after obtaining the consent of
Parent to such amendment or supplement, shall promptly transmit such amendment
or supplement to the Company's stockholders.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if Acquisition Sub shall own by virtue of the Offer or otherwise at
least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties shall
take all necessary and appropriate action


                                       33




<PAGE>


to cause the merger of Acquisition Sub and the Company to become effective as
soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as such expiration
date may have been extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
without a stockholders' meeting in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL (a
"Short Form Merger").

         (d) Parent agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock, if any,
owned by Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to be voted in favor of the adoption
of the Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

     6.2 Regulatory Approvals. Each party shall use all reasonable efforts to
file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit promptly any
additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after
the date of this Agreement, prepare and file any notifications required under
any applicable antitrust Laws in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from
any antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust
or related matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall (a) give the other
party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of commencement of any
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) keep
the other party informed as to the status of any such Proceeding or threat, and
(c) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Body regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Body or by any Law, (y) each party will consult and cooperate with
the other, and will consider in good faith the views of the other, in connection
with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, Proceeding under
or relating to any foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade Law, and
(z) in connection with any such Proceeding, each party will permit authorized
Representatives of the other to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to any such Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Body in connection with any such Proceeding. At the request, and
only at the request, of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to its or its Subsidiaries' ability to operate or
retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the
consummation of the Offer.

     6.3 Stock Options.

         (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of a Company
Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive, in
settlement of each Company Option a "Cash Amount". All Options shall terminate
as of the Effective Time. The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the product of (i)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Option at the Effective Time and (ii) the number of shares
subject to such Company Option. Except as provided for in Section 6.3(b) or as
may be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company, all stock option plans
established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the
Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be deleted,
terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time.


                                       34




<PAGE>


         (b) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue
to be bound by the Company's commitment to issue options pursuant to the
Company's Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed with the SEC on October
28, 2002, as amended (the "Option Tender Offer"), it being understood that such
options issued pursuant to the Option Tender Offer (hereinafter "Assumed
Option") shall be options to purchase shares of Parent common stock $.01 par
value per share ("Parent Common Stock"). In furtherance of the foregoing, (i)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of such
Assumed Option shall be equal to the Assumed Option Exchange Ratio (as defined
in Section 6.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock which had been purchasable upon exercise of the
Company options surrendered in the Option Tender Offer, and (ii) the per share
exercise price under each such Assumed Option shall be the closing sale price of
a share of Parent Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the
day on which the Assumed Options are granted pursuant to the Option Tender
Offer, and rounding up to the nearest cent. The Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company has determined that the foregoing conversion formula is reasonable and
complies with terms of the Option Tender Offer.

         (c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the request of Parent, the Company
shall take all action (including amending any and all of the Company's existing
stock option plans and program and any and all stock option agreements) that
Parent determines may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company
Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of
Company Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this Section 6.3.

         (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options. Parent shall file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act or on
another appropriate form, reasonably promptly following the Effective Time, with
respect to Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or statements for so long as the Assumed Options remain
outstanding and exercisable.

     6.4 Employee Benefits.

         (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Companies who
continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation's
health and welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that (i) nothing in this
Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit plan at any time (including as of the Effective Time), and (ii) if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare
benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be immediately eligible to
participate in Parent's health and welfare Plans ("Parent Employee Benefit
Plans") to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Continuing Employees shall be
entitled to participate in a plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Parent or its Subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Each
Continuing Employee's period of service and compensation history with the
Company and the Acquired Companies shall be counted in determining eligibility
for, and the amount and vesting of, benefits under each Parent Employee Benefit
Plan (including, without limitation, the Parent 401(k) Plan). Each Continuing
Employee who participates in a Parent


                                       35




<PAGE>


Employee Benefit Plan that provides health care benefits (whether or not through
insurance) shall participate without regard to any waiting period or any
condition or exclusion based on pre-existing conditions, medical history, claims
experience, evidence of insurability, or genetic factors, and shall receive full
credit for any co-payments or deductible payments, or account balances under any
cafeteria or flexible spending plan made before the Closing Date. In the event
that any Continuing Employee receives an "eligible rollover distribution"
(within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from an Employee Benefit
Plan of the Company intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a
"Company 401(k) Plan"), Parent shall cause a Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a
direct rollover of such eligible rollover distribution (including, but not
limited to, any portion of such eligible rollover distribution comprised of the
outstanding balance of a loan from such Company 401(k) Plan). Nothing in this
Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

         (b) Unless Parent provides written notice otherwise, the Company shall
terminate, effective as of the day immediately prior to and contingent upon the
Company becoming a member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as such
term is defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "401(k)
Termination Date"), any Company 401(k) Plan. The Company shall provide Parent
evidence that the Company 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the board of directors of the applicable Acquired Company (the
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval
of Parent) effective as of the 401(k) Termination Date.

     6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

         (a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons
who are or have at any time been directors and officers of the Company (the
"Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the Company's bylaws and certificate of
incorporation as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent
available under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time.

         (b) Provided that the officers of the Company as of the date hereof
prepare and execute the application with respect thereto, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons
with respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
a "tail" policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance (the "Tail
Policy") covering the period of time from the Effective Time until up to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, providing comparable coverage to the
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the
Company as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for such Tail Policy in excess
of $3 million, and, in the event the aggregate premium for such Tail Policy
exceeds $3 million, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to alter the
terms of such coverage and/or period of such coverage under the Tail Policy to
such terms of coverage and/or period of time that can be obtained for an
aggregate premium equal to $3 million.

         (c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate
the purposes of this Section 6.5, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and


                                       36




<PAGE>


assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5, and none
of the actions described in clause "(i)" or clause "(ii)" shall be taken until
such provision is made.

         (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section 6.5. The provisions of
this Section 6.5 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his heirs
and representatives, and are in addition to and not in substitution for, any
other right to indemnification or contribution that such Indemnified Person may
have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, under any acquisition Contract, under the DGCL or
otherwise.

     6.6 Additional Agreements.

         (a) Subject to Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to
consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 6.6(b), each party to this Agreement (i) shall
make all filings and give all notices required to be made and given by such
party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain
each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or
Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and each of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(iii) shall use all reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or
other legal bar to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall promptly deliver to the other
parties a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such
Consent obtained by such party during the Pre-Closing Period.

         (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to
dispose of or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to
dispose of any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the
Acquired Companies to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to
license or otherwise make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license
or otherwise make available, to any Person, any technology, Software or
Intangible, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to license or
otherwise make available to any Person any technology, Software or Intangible;
(iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any
assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to
cause any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any assets or operations;
(v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any
Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future
operations of any of the Acquired Companies; or (vi) to contest any Proceeding
relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement if Parent determines in good faith that contesting such
Proceeding might not be in Parent's best interest.

     6.7 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect
to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
