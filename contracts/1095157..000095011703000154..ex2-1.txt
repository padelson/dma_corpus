iii            AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  PARTIES: CAMINUS
CORPORATION  a Delaware corporation (the "Company")  825 Third Avenue  New
York, NY 10022    SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC.  a Delaware corporation
("Parent")  1285 Drummers Lane  Suite 300  Wayne, PA 19087    RAPID
RESOURCES INC.  a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition Sub")  1285 Drummers
Lane  Suite 300  Wayne, PA 19087   DATE: JANUARY 20, 2003  
BACKGROUND   A. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company have each determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company
upon the terms and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.   B. It is proposed that Acquisition Sub make a cash tender
offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock,
$.01 par value per share of the Company ("Company Common Stock") for $9.00
per share (such amount, or any greater per share amount paid pursuant to the
Offer, subject to Section 1.1(e), being the "Per Share Amount"), upon the
terms and provisions of and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.  
C. In furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the respective
boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have each
approved a merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub with and into
the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation, upon the terms
and provisions of and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   D. By resolutions duly adopted, the board of directors of the
Company has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions hereof: (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders; and (ii) resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares pursuant
to the Offer and adopt this Agreement.   E. In order to induce Parent and
Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement certain of the stockholders, executive officers
and directors of the             Company set forth on Exhibit B
hereto are executing a tender and voting agreement in favor of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (the "Tender and Voting Agreement").   F. Capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings set forth in Exhibit A hereto.  
INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, in consideration of the mutual
agreements contained herein and subject to the satisfaction of the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   Section
1: THE OFFER   1.1 Conduct of the Offer.   (a) Provided that this
Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8 hereof
and that none of the events or circumstances set forth in Annex I shall have
occurred or exist (excluding the events or circumstances set forth in
paragraph "(a)" in Annex I), as promptly as practicable (and in any event not
later than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, provided
that the Company has, within a reasonable time prior theretofore, provided
Parent with the information about the Company required to be included in the
Offer Statement (defined below)), Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.   (b) Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub
shall accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is permitted to do so
under applicable Law and shall pay for such shares promptly thereafter (and
in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act). The
obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any shares
of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to
(i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn
a number of shares of Company Common Stock that (including the shares
tendered under the Tender and Voting Agreement) immediately prior to the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer ("Parent-Owned Shares"), represents at least a majority of the Fully
Diluted Number of Company Shares (the "Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other
conditions set forth in Annex I. Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right
at its sole discretion to increase the initial Per Share Amount, to waive (in
whole or in part) any of the conditions of the offer set forth in Annex I or
to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided
that without the prior written consent of the Company: (i) the Minimum
Condition may not be amended or waived; (ii) no change may be made that
changes the form of consideration to be paid, that reduces the Per Share
Amount or that changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in
the Offer, or imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Minimum
Condition and the conditions set forth in Annex I; (iii) except as provided
in Section 1.1(c), no change may be made that extends the expiration date of
the Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer, and (iv) no change
may be made that amends any other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to
the holders of the Company Common Stock. Simultaneously with the acceptance
for payment of any shares in the Offer, Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to
deposit with the Paying Agent immediately available cash funds sufficient to
pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer.   (c) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to
expire 20 business days following the date of the commencement thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the parties\' respective termination rights under Section 8.1, (i)
if,       2           at any then-scheduled expiration date,
any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived,
Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to extend the Offer for such amount of time
as is reasonably necessary to cause such conditions to the Offer to be
satisfied; (ii) Acquisition Sub may, without the consent of the Company or
any other Person (A) extend the Offer (one or more times) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
applicable to the Offer and (B) if the sum of (1) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that shall have been validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer (other than shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred) as of the scheduled or
extended expiration date of the Offer, plus (2) the number of Parent-Owned
Shares as of such date, represents more than a majority of the Fully Diluted
Number of Company Shares but less than 90% of the Fully Diluted Number of
Company Shares as of such date, extend the Offer (one or more times) for an
aggregate additional period of not more than 20 business days; (iii)
Acquisition Sub may, without the consent of the Company or any other Person,
elect to provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions
thereof) pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, Rule 14d under the
Exchange Act; and (iv) if, at any then-scheduled expiration date any of the
conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub
shall, if the Company so requests in writing, extend the Offer for 10
business days.   (d) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by
reference the offer to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer (the "Offer Statement") and form of the related letter of
transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer Statement and related documents to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that
they shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule TO and all
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the
"Offer Documents") to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other
applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer and to correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as supplemented or amended to
correct such information to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all information concerning the Acquired
Companies and the Company\'s stockholders that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(d).
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents (including any amendment thereto) prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to provide
the Company and its counsel with any comments Parent, Acquisition Sub or
their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments.   (e) If, between the
date of this Agreement and the date on which any particular share of Company
Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different number or class
of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares,
stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction,      
3          then the Per Share Amount shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect such change or transaction.   1.2 Company Actions.   (a) The
Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents that its
board of directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has by the unanimous
vote of all directors of the Company (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of
the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), (iii) declared that this
Agreement is advisable, (iv) resolved to recommend that stockholders of the
Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer and, to the extent necessary under applicable law
to accomplish the Merger, adopt this Agreement (the recommendation of the
Company\'s board of directors that the stockholders of the Company accept the
Offer and tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
and adopt this Agreement being referred to as the "Company Board
Recommendation"), and (v) to the extent necessary, adopted a resolution
having the effect of causing the Company not to be subject to any state
takeover law or similar Law, including, without limitation, Section 203 of
the DGCL, that might otherwise apply to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Section 5.3:
(A) the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents; and (B) the Company Board
Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, and no resolution by the board of directors of the
Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub shall be
adopted or proposed.   (b) As promptly as practicable on the day that the
Offer is commenced, the Company shall file with the SEC and (following or
contemporaneously with the dissemination of the Offer Statement and related
documents) disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule
14D-9") that shall reflect, subject to Section 5.3, the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as supplemented or amended to correct such information to be filed with
the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment thereto) prior to
the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments.   (c) The Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to,
promptly furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub with a list of its stockholders,
mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the
names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and lists of securities positions of shares of Company Common Stock     
4          held in stock depositories, in each case true and correct
as of the most recent practicable date, and will provide to Parent such
additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent
or Acquisition Sub may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and
the Merger. Parent and Acquisition Sub and their agents shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
will use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver to
the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable efforts to cause their
agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control.   1.3
Directors.   (a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to
designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company\'s board of directors that equals the product of (i) the total
number of directors on the Company\'s board of directors (giving effect to
the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section) and (ii) a
fraction whose numerator is the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub (including shares
of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer), and
whose denominator is the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding, and the Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary to cause Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company\'s board of directors, including increasing the number of directors,
and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time,
to the extent requested by Parent, the Company will also use all commercially
reasonable actions to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute
the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each
committee of the Company\'s board of directors and (ii) each board
of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof)
that represents the same percentage as individuals designated by Parent
represent on the board of directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause at least two of the members of the
Company\'s board of directors, at all times prior to the Effective Time, to
be individuals who were directors of the Company and were not officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (the
"Continuing Directors"); provided, however, that if at any time prior to the
Effective Time there shall be in office only one Continuing Director for any
reason, the Company\'s board of directors shall cause a person who is not an
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries designated by
the remaining Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall
be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement),
and if at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then
remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall use
reasonable efforts to designate two persons to fill such vacancies who are
not officers or employees or affiliates of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates (and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement).   (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees
to the Company\'s board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act require in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have provided to
the Company on a timely basis the      5          information
with respect to Parent and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 of the Exchange Act. The provisions
of this Section 1.3 are in addition to and shall not limit any rights which
Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder
or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of
applicable law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.  
(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the Continuing Directors or if there shall only be one, of a Continuing
Director, shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company\'s board of directors and
no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Company\'s board of directors, any extension of time
for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or
Acquisition Sub requiring the consent of the Company, any waiver of
compliance by the Company of any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of the Company or its stockholders, any required or
permitted consent or action by the board of directors of the Company
hereunder and any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely
affects the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or
Acquisition Sub); provided, that, if for any reason there shall be no
Continuing Directors and the Company has used commercially reasonable efforts
to appoint Continuing Directors but has been unable after a reasonable period
of time to find suitable candidates willing to serve, such actions may
be effected by majority vote of the entire board of directors of the
Company.   Section 2: MERGER TRANSACTION   2.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub
into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease and the Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").   2.2
Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all property of the Company and Acquisition Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall become debts, liabilities, obligations
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   2.3 Closing; Effective Time.
Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 8 hereof,
the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the New
York offices of Blank Rome LLP, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than
the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Section 7 (other than
delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being
understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Closing), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a
certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL
shall be duly executed by the Company and, concurrently with or as soon as
practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of the
State      6          of Delaware. The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time
as is specified in the certificate of merger (the "Effective Time").   2.4
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:   (a)
subject to Section 6.5(a), the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform
to the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until thereafter changed or
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable law;   (b)
subject to Section 6.5(a), the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
until thereafter changed or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and applicable law;   (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who
are directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be; and   (d)
the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time shall be the respective individuals who are officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.   2.5 Conversion of Shares.  
(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:   (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the
Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in the
Company\'s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;   (ii) any
shares of Company Common Stock, if any, then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;   (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above
and subject to Sections 2.5(b), 2.5(c) and 2.7, each share of Company Common
Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest; and   (iv)
each of the shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Acquisition Sub then outstanding shall be converted into one share of Company
Common Stock.   (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of      7          shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change
or transaction.   (c) If, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company or
under which the Company has any rights, then the Merger Consideration payable
with respect thereto will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition. The Company shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other
right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.   2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.   (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Such
funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole
and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and no part
of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5, a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such
Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for
the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing shares of Company Common
Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be endorsed properly
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established
to the satisfaction of Acquisition Sub that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.6(b), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time,
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate. If
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of     
8          the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to
deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.   (c) At any time
following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds
which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including, without limitation, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. If any Certificates shall
not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Body), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (d) At the close of business on the day of
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall
be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.   (e) Each of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold) from the
consideration otherwise payable in the Merger to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   2.7 Shares
Subject to Appraisal Rights.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL are or, prior to the Effective Time become, applicable to the
Merger, any shares of Company Common Stock that, as of the Effective Time,
are held by holders who have as of the Effective Time preserved appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.5(a), and the holder or holders of such shares
shall be entitled only to such rights as may be provided to such holder or
holders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if such
appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holders of such shares shall
otherwise lose their appraisal rights with respect to such shares, then, as
of the later of the Effective Time or the      9          time
of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such rights, such shares
shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to
receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares) the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.5(a).   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require
the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to
the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or
settlement offer.   2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be reasonably necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Acquisition Sub and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to
take such action.   Section 3: REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

provided that Company may not, except as permitted by Section 5.3(b),
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company will

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the time of acceptance of Company
Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company may
furnish information concerning its businesses or its Subsidiaries, properties
or assets to any Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the
rules promulgated thereunder) and may negotiate and participate in
discussions and negotiations with such Person or group concerning a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), provided that such Person or group shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement, the confidentiality provisions of
which shall not be materially more favorable to such third party than those
provided for in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such
confidentiality agreement must permit the Company to disclose to Parent all
of the information required to be disclosed by the Company to Parent by this
Section 5.3) if:   (x) such Person or group has submitted a Superior
Proposal;   (y) in the good faith opinion of the Company\'s board of
directors,  determined only after consulting with independent legal counsel
to the  Company, the failure to do so would result in a breach of the
board\'s  fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable
law; and   (z) the Company has notified Parent in writing of its intention
to  engage in such discussions or negotiations or to provide such
confidential  information not less than the 24 hours prior to so doing.  
The Company will promptly (but in no case later than 24 hours after
receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing of the existence of any proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry received by the Company regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, and the Company will immediately communicate to Parent
the material terms of any proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry that
it may receive regarding any Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
party making such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or
negotiation. The Company will promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal which was not previously provided to Parent.
The Company will keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of the status and
details of any such Acquisition Proposal and of any amendments or proposed
amendments to any    31        Acquisition Proposal and of the
status of any discussions or negotiations relating to any Acquisition
Proposal.   (b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.3(b), neither the
board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement that is entered into in accordance

with the provisions of this Section 5.3, prior to the time of acceptance for
payment of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Company\'s board
of directors, after consulting with independent legal counsel, may withdraw
or modify the Company Board Recommendation, approve or recommend a Superior
Proposal, or enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, if
the board determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would
result in a breach of the board\'s fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
stockholders under applicable law, provided that in each case the Company has
given Parent written notice at least three business days in advance of such
action that the board of directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal that it intends to accept, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making
such Superior Proposal.   (c) Nothing in this Section 5.3, and no action
taken by the board of directors of the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3,
will (i) permit the Company to enter into any agreement providing for any
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement to the extent permitted under Section 5.3 hereof)
for as long as this Agreement remains in effect or (ii) affect in any manner
any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement.   (d) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide offer,
proposal or other indication of interest regarding any of the following
(other than the transactions provided for in this Agreement involving the
Company): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination or other similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of all or a significant
portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
including, without limitation, any license, lease or other transfer or
disposition of all or a significant portion of the Software and Intangibles
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions; (iii) any purchase of or
tender offer or exchange offer for 10% percent or more of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company, or the filing of a registration
statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any
public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of
the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal on terms which the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, taking into consideration such matters that it
deems relevant (including, without limitation, the additional time necessary
to consummate the Acquisition Proposal), to be more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders than the Offer and the Merger (based on advice of the
Company\'s independent financial advisor that the value of the consideration
provided for in such proposal is superior to the value of the consideration
provided for in the Offer), for which financing, to the extent required, is
(based upon the advice of the Company\'s independent financial advisor)
reasonably capable of being obtained; provided, however, that for purposes of
this definition, "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to refer only to a
transaction involving a majority of the    32        outstanding
voting securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company.   (e) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release
of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of,
any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the
Acquired Companies is a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies
has any rights, and will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also will
promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal or
equity investment to return all confidential information heretofore furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies.   5.4
Certain Resolutions. The board of directors of the Company or
the compensation committee thereof shall pass any necessary resolutions as
soon as practicable after the date hereof to provide for the treatment of
Company Options as set forth in Section 6.3 of this Agreement.   Section 6:

shall (a) give the other party prompt notice of the commencement or threat of
commencement of any Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) keep the other party informed as to the
status of any such Proceeding or threat, and (c) promptly inform the other
party of any communication to or from any Governmental Body regarding the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any
Law, (y) each party will consult and cooperate with the other, and will
consider in good faith the views of the other, in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, Proceeding under or
relating to any foreign, federal or state antitrust or fair trade Law,
and (z) in connection with any such Proceeding, each party will permit
authorized Representatives of the other to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to any such Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any such Proceeding. At
the request, and only at the request, of Parent, the Company shall agree to
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to its or its
Subsidiaries\' ability to operate or retain any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that any
such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer.   6.3 Stock
Options.   (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each holder of a
Company Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall
receive, in settlement of each Company Option a "Cash Amount". All Options
shall terminate as of the Effective Time. The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Option at the Effective Time and
(ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option. Except as provided
for in Section 6.3(b) or as may be otherwise agreed to by Parent and the
Company, all stock option plans established by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in
any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of
any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company shall be deleted, terminated and of no further
force or effect as of the Effective Time.    34         (b) As of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be bound by
the Company\'s commitment to issue options pursuant to the Company\'s Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed with the SEC on October 28, 2002, as
amended (the "Option Tender Offer"), it being understood that such options
issued pursuant to the Option Tender Offer (hereinafter "Assumed Option")
shall be options to purchase shares of Parent common stock $.01 par value per
share ("Parent Common Stock"). In furtherance of the foregoing, (i) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of
such Assumed Option shall be equal to the Assumed Option Exchange Ratio (as
defined in Section 6.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock which had been purchasable upon
exercise of the Company options surrendered in the Option Tender Offer, and
(ii) the per share exercise price under each such Assumed Option shall be the
closing sale price of a share of Parent Common Stock reported on the New York
Stock Exchange on the day on which the Assumed Options are granted pursuant
to the Option Tender Offer, and rounding up to the nearest cent. The Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company has determined that the foregoing conversion
formula is reasonable and complies with terms of the Option Tender Offer.  
(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the request of Parent, the Company shall
take all action (including amending any and all of the Company\'s
existing stock option plans and program and any and all stock option
agreements) that Parent determines may be necessary (under the plans pursuant
to which Company Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Options have no rights with respect
thereto other than those specifically provided in this Section 6.3.   (d)
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Assumed Options. Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the
Securities Act or on another appropriate form, reasonably promptly following
the Effective Time, with respect to Parent Common Stock subject to the
Assumed Options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or statements for so long as the
Assumed Options remain outstanding and exercisable.   6.4 Employee
Benefits.   (a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Acquired Companies
who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") shall be eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving
Corporation\'s health and welfare benefit plans; provided, however, that (i)
nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such
health or welfare benefit plan at any time (including as of the Effective
Time), and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such
health or welfare benefit plan, then the Continuing Employees shall be
immediately eligible to participate in Parent\'s health and welfare Plans
("Parent Employee Benefit Plans") to substantially the same extent as
similarly situated employees of Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time,
the Continuing Employees shall be entitled to participate in a plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section
401(k) of the Code sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (a "Parent 401(k) Plan"). Each Continuing Employee\'s period of
service and compensation history with the Company and the Acquired Companies
shall be counted in determining eligibility for, and the amount and vesting
of, benefits under each Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including, without
limitation, the Parent 401(k) Plan). Each Continuing Employee who
participates in a Parent    35        Employee Benefit Plan that
provides health care benefits (whether or not through insurance) shall
participate without regard to any waiting period or any condition or
exclusion based on pre-existing conditions, medical history,
claims experience, evidence of insurability, or genetic factors, and shall
receive full credit for any co-payments or deductible payments, or account
balances under any cafeteria or flexible spending plan made before the
Closing Date. In the event that any Continuing Employee receives an "eligible
rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from an Employee Benefit Plan of the Company intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"), Parent shall cause a
Parent 401(k) Plan to accept a direct rollover of such eligible rollover
distribution (including, but not limited to, any portion of such eligible
rollover distribution comprised of the outstanding balance of a loan from
such Company 401(k) Plan). Nothing in this Section 6.4(a) or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee
shall be "at will" employment.   (b) Unless Parent provides written notice
otherwise, the Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately
prior to and contingent upon the Company becoming a member of the same
Controlled Group of Corporations (as such term is defined in Section 414(b)
of the Code) as Parent (the "401(k) Termination Date"), any Company 401(k)
Plan. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that the Company 401(k) Plans
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company (the form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent) effective as of the 401(k)
Termination Date.   6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.   (a)
All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who are or
have at any time been directors and officers of the Company (the "Indemnified
Persons") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
as provided in the Company\'s bylaws and certificate of incorporation as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall
be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six years from the Effective Time.   (b)
Provided that the officers of the Company as of the date hereof prepare and
execute the application with respect thereto, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect
to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, a "tail"
policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (the "Tail Policy")
covering the period of time from the Effective Time until up to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, providing comparable coverage to
the existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained
by the Company as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for such Tail
Policy in excess of $3 million, and, in the event the aggregate premium for
such Tail Policy exceeds $3 million, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to alter the terms of such coverage and/or period of such coverage
under the Tail Policy to such terms of coverage and/or period of time that
can be obtained for an aggregate premium equal to $3 million.   (c) In the
event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this
Section 6.5, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and   
36        assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.5, and none of the actions described in clause "(i)" or clause
"(ii)" shall be taken until such provision is made.   (d) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligations under this Section 6.5. The provisions of this
Section 6.5 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person and his heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to and not in substitution for,
any other right to indemnification or contribution that such Indemnified
Person may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, under any acquisition Contract, under
the DGCL or otherwise.   6.6 Additional Agreements.   (a) Subject to
Section 6.6(b), Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Section 6.6(b), each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings and
give all notices required to be made and given by such party in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if
any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and each
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) shall use
all reasonable efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar
to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party shall promptly deliver to the other parties a copy
of each such filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent
obtained by such party during the Pre-Closing Period.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not have
any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause
any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to
cause any of the Acquired Companies to dispose of any assets; (ii) to
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to
discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise
make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make
available, to any Person, any technology, Software or Intangible, or to
commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to license or otherwise make
available to any Person any technology, Software or Intangible; (iv) to hold
separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or
operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause
any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any assets or operations; (v)
to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to
any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the
future operations of any of the Acquired Companies; or (vi) to contest any
Proceeding relating to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if Parent determines in good faith that
contesting such Proceeding might not be in Parent\'s best interest.   6.7
Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies to, make
any disclosure to employees of any of the Acquired Companies, to the public
or otherwise regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless (a) Parent shall have been given the
opportunity to review and comment upon such disclosure and shall   
37        have approved such disclosure or (b) the Company shall have
been advised in writing by its outside legal counsel that such disclosure is
required by applicable law.   6.8 Resignation of Officers and Directors.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver
to Parent on or prior to the acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer the resignation of each director of each of the
Acquired Companies (subject to Section 1.3) and such officers of the Acquired
Companies as Parent shall request.   6.9 General Cooperation. From the date
hereof through the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies will use their
commercially reasonable good faith efforts to operate their businesses in
such a manner as to achieve a smooth transition consistent with the mutual
business interests of the Acquired Companies and Parent. In this regard, the
Acquired Companies and Parent agree that they will enter into good faith
discussions concerning the businesses of the Acquired Companies, including,
but not limited to, personnel policies and procedures, and other operational
matters.   6.10 Section 16 Matters. The board of directors of the Company
shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time providing that the
disposition by the officers and directors of Company Common Stock, Company
Options or other equity securities of the Company pursuant to the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended
to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.   Section 7: CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE MERGER   The obligations of

to the Closing, of each of the following conditions:   7.1 Stockholder

temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have been issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction and remain in effect, and there shall not be
any Law enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger that makes consummation of
the Merger illegal; provided that, subject to Section 6.6(b), in the case of

such restraining order, injunction or other order and to appeal as

this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) unless the Company shall have

material breach of any representation of warranty by such party at or prior
to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer; and (ii) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate

respect, in each case as of the date of this Agreement or as of a date
subsequent to the date of this Agreement as if made on such subsequent date
(other than to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and

performed and complied, in all material respects, with each material covenant
or agreement contained in the Agreement and required to be performed or
complied with by it; provided, however, if such inaccuracy or breach is
curable by the Company, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
