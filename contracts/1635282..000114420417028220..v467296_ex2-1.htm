Merger Consideration Per Fully Diluted Share and (b) the exercise price per
share for each such Acquiror Option shall be equal to the exercise price per

Consideration Per Fully Diluted Share (as calculated by _multiplying_ the
number of Acquiror Common Shares comprising the Merger Consideration Per
Fully Diluted Share _by_ $10.00 (such result, the " _Per-Share Dollar Value_
")) (any such Company Warrant being referred to herein as " _In The Money_ "),

and shall be converted, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, into
shares of the applicable class of the Company's Capital Stock (as prescribed

Exercise, in all cases pursuant to a consent and conversion agreement, as

Section 3.6 _Final Calculation of Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date,
and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days thereof, the GPIAC-
Designated Directors (or appointed representatives thereof) shall prepare
(and Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to,
assist the GPIAC-Designated Directors and their representatives in preparing,
as required) and deliver to the Holder Representative (i) a calculation of
the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of the Company (" _Closing Date
Indebtedness_ "), (ii) a calculation of Cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Company (" _Closing Date Cash_ ") and (iii) a calculation of unpaid and
accrued Transaction Expenses (" _Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses_ "),
in each case, calculated as of the close of business on the Closing Date
without giving effect to the consummation of the Mergers or any financing
transactions in connection therewith or, after the First Effective Time, any
other action or omission by Acquiror, the First-Step Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries that is not
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (such
delivered statement, the " _Acquiror Closing Calculation Statement_ ").
Following the Closing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to, provide the GPIAC-Designated Directors and the Holder
Representative and their respective representatives access to the records,
properties, personnel and (subject to the execution of customary work paper
access letters if requested) auditors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to the preparation of the Company's Financial Statements and
calculations of Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, Estimated Closing Date
Cash and Estimated Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses and shall cause
the personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate
with the GPIAC-Designated Directors, the Holder Representative and their
respective representatives in connection with their review of the Company's
Indebtedness, Cash and Cash Equivalents and unpaid Transaction Expenses, in
each case, calculated as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation
of Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and/or Closing Date Unpaid
Transaction Expenses, it shall notify the GPIAC-Designated Directors of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars
of such disagreement, within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the
Acquiror Closing Calculation Statement. In the event that the Holder
Representative does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such
forty-five (45) day period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted the calculation of Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and
Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses delivered by the GPIAC-Designated
Directors, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. In the event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided,
the GPIAC-Designated Directors and the Holder Representative shall use
reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any such disagreements
specified in such notice. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to
resolve such disagreements, then Ernst and Young (or such independent accounting
or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may be
mutually selected by the GPIAC-Designated Directors and the Holder
Representative) (the " _Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. Each of the GPIAC-Designated Directors and the Holder
Representative shall promptly provide their assertions regarding such
disagreements in writing to the Auditor and to each other. The Auditor shall
be instructed to render its determination with respect to such disagreements
as soon as reasonably possible (which the parties hereto agree should not be
later than ninety (90) days following the day on which any such disagreements
are referred to the Auditor). The Auditor shall base its determination solely
on (i) the written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which the Closing
Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and/or Closing Date Unpaid Transaction
Expenses require adjustment (only with respect to the remaining disagreements
submitted to the Auditor) in order to be determined in accordance with
_Section 3.6(a)_ (including the definitions of the defined terms used in
_Section 3.6(a)_ ). The determination of the Auditor shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. The date on which Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses
are finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.6(b)_ is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Determination Date_." All fees and expenses
of the Auditor relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor
hereunder shall be borne by Acquiror.

  



    

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If, on the Determination Date, (i) Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, _minus_ Closing Date Indebtedness (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ ), _plus_ (ii) Closing Date Cash (as finally
determined in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ ), _minus_ Estimated Closing
Date Cash, _plus_ (iii) Estimated Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses,
_minus_  Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses (as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ ) is a negative number, then the GPIAC
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of the
absolute value of such negative number (the " _Deficit Amount_ ") in
accordance with _Article XII_.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the date that
is one year after the First Effective Time, Acquiror shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to deliver to Acquiror all cash, Certificates and other
documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing
Holder of a Certificate (in respect of shares of Capital Stock other than
Excluded Shares) who has not delivered a Certificate may surrender such
Certificate, and each former holder of Company Warrants who has not delivered
a Conversion Agreement or a Specified Conversion Agreement may deliver such
Conversion Agreement or Specified Conversion Agreement, to Acquiror and
(subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive
in consideration therefor, and Acquiror shall promptly deliver, the portion of
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this _Article III_ without any interest thereon. None
of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company, the First-Step Surviving Corporation,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this _Article
III_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary amount as Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this 
_Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision
to this Agreement, Acquiror, the Company, the Exchange Agent and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise
deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other consideration
otherwise paid or delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement, to any Person such amounts that Acquiror, the Company, the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision
of Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and duly
deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority by Acquiror, the
Company, the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 3.10 _Dissenting Shares_. If, pursuant to the terms of
NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, holders of Capital Stock are entitled to
dissenter's rights, then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted such
Capital Stock in favor of the First Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have properly demanded and perfected dissenter's rights under
NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(e),_ but instead shall be
entitled to receive such payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Dissenting Shares as shall be determined pursuant to the NRS; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holder's right to
dissent and demand payment of fair value under the NRS, each such share of
Capital Stock held by such holder shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, as of the First Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ , and each such
share of Capital Stock shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Acquiror of any written demands received by the
Company for payment of the fair value (as defined in NRS 92A.320) in respect
of any shares of Capital Stock and attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to NRS 92A.440 and received by the
Company, and Acquiror shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Acquiror, voluntarily make or agree to make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of shares of Capital
Stock, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of
any such demands.

Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there

assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth
in this _Section 7.2_.

reasonable best efforts to cure such Terminating Company Breach (the "
_Company Cure Period_ "), such termination shall not be effective, and such
termination shall become effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is
not cured within the Company Cure Period, (ii) the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby is permanently enjoined, prohibited or
otherwise restrained or made illegal by the terms of a final, non-appealable
order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, (iii) the Closing has
not occurred on or before August 31, 2017 (the " _End Date_ "), unless
Acquiror is in willful breach hereof and such breach is the primary reason for
the Closing not occurring on or before such date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event any of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ ,
_Section 9.1(b)_ ,  _Section 9.1(c)_ , _Section 9.1(d)_ , _Section 9.1(e)_ ,
_Section 9.1(f)_ , _Section 9.1(i)_ , _Section 9.1(j)_  or _Section 9.1(k)_
shall not have been satisfied on or before the End Date but all of the other
conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied on or before the End Date, either Acquiror or the Company may
by notice delivered to the other party unilaterally extend the End Date to
November 17, 2017, in which case the End Date shall be deemed for all
purposes to be such date; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that
Acquiror delivers such a notice to extend the End Date, any subsequent event
of default of the Company under its current financing arrangements as a result
of not raising such capital as the Company is required to obtain under such
arrangements on or before September 1, 2017, shall not in itself be deemed a
failure of any condition in _Section 9.2_ or give rise to a right to
indemnification on the part of the Acquiror Pre-Closing Holders or (iv) a
fully-executed copy of each of the Transaction Support and Voting Agreements
has not been received by Acquiror by 5:00 p.m. EDT on the Business Day of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement; or

(f) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Acquiror from the
Company if (i) there is any material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Acquiror or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions specified in  _Section
9.3(a)_ and _Section 9.3(b)_ would not be satisfied at the Closing (a "
_Terminating Acquiror Breach_ "), except that, if any such Terminating
Acquiror Breach is curable by Acquiror through the exercise of its reasonable
best efforts, then, for a period of up to twenty (20) days after receipt by
Acquiror of notice from the Company of such breach, but only as long as
Acquiror continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts to cure such
Terminating Acquiror Breach (the " _Acquiror Cure Period_ "), such
termination shall not be effective, and such termination shall become
effective only if the Terminating Acquiror Breach is not cured within the
Acquiror Cure Period, (ii) the First Merger shall not have been consummated on
the second Business Day (the " _Notification Date_ ") after all of the
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied on the
Notification Date; _provided_  that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)(ii)_ unless (A) the Company gives
Acquiror prior notice of such proposed termination on or following the
Notification Date and (B) the First Merger is not consummated on or prior to
the day that is two Business Days following the date of delivery of such
notice, (iii) the Closing has not occurred on or before the End Date (as may
be extended as provided in _Section 10.1(c)_ ), unless the Company is in
willful breach hereof and such breach is the primary reason for the Closing
not occurring on or before such date, or (iv) the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby is permanently enjoined, prohibited or
otherwise restrained or made illegal by the terms of a final, non-appealable
order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability on the
part of any party hereto or its respective Affiliates, officers, directors or
stockholders, other than liability of the Company, Acquiror or Merger Sub, as
the case may be, for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination, except that (i) the provisions of _Sections 10.2_ , _13.5_ , 
_13.6_ , _13.7_ , _13.14_ and _13.16_ herein, _Article XI_ herein, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall survive any termination of this Agreement
and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Acquiror nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities arising out of its willful and material breach of any covenant of
this Agreement prior to such termination or willful and material breach of any
of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement prior to
such termination.

  



  

Article XI 
  
 _ HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE; GPIAC-DESIGNATED DIRECTORS_

  



  

Section 11.1 _Holder Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Designation of Holder Representative_. The parties have agreed
that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of Pre-
Closing Holders as specified herein (the " _Holder Representative_ "). The
Company and each Pre-Closing Holder hereby appoints Robin Murray as the
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the Pre-Closing Holders with
full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of the Pre-
Closing Holders with respect to the performance on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders under the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the related
agreements, as the same may be from time to time amended, and to do or
refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to execute all such
documents on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders as the Holder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate without inquiry of and without additional
approval from the Pre-Closing Holders in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the related agreements,
including those authorities identified in subsection (c) below. This grant of
authority (including the appointment of agency and this power of attorney) (i)
shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside of this Agreement and shall
be binding on the Pre-Closing Holders, (ii) is coupled with an interest and
will be irrevocable and will not be terminated by any Pre-Closing Holder or by
operation of Law, whether by the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation
or incapacity of any Pre-Closing Holder or the occurrence of any other
event, and any action taken by Holder Representative will be as valid as if
such death, incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation, incapacity or other event
had not occurred, regardless of whether or not any Pre-Closing Holder or
Holder Representative will have received any notice thereof and shall be
binding on any successor thereto and (iii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Escrow Stockholder of the whole or fraction of his, her or
its interest in the Indemnification Escrow Shares.

  



    

 | 72| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Replacement of Holder Representative_. The Holder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Holder Representative may be
removed by the vote of Escrow Stockholders who collectively own more than
fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnification Escrow Shares (the "
_Majority Holders_ "). In the event that a Holder Representative resigns or
is removed in accordance herewith, a new Holder Representative shall be
appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Holder
Representative.

  



  

(c) _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations
on Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and
authority as are granted in this _Section 11.1_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of
the Pre-Closing Holders, except as expressly provided herein. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full
power, authority and discretion to, for and on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders (and, as applicable, the Escrow Stockholders):

  



  

(i) from and after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments
to this Agreement and the other related agreements;

  



  

(ii) agree to, dispute, negotiate, compromise, settle and take other
actions as may be necessary or desirable in respect of any matters
contemplated by this Agreement or the other related agreements, including in
connection with final calculation and determination of Closing Date
Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses,
as contemplated in _Section 3.6_ ;

  



  

(iii) authorize, administer or object to the release and disbursement
of the Indemnification Escrow Shares pursuant to _Section 12_ ;
provided, however, the Holder Representative is not acting as a withholding
agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Indemnification Escrow Shares and is not responsible for any Tax reporting or
withholding with respect thereto;

  



  

(iv) to deduct and/or hold back any funds that may be payable to any
Pre-Closing Holder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other
related agreements in order to pay any amount that may be payable by such Pre-
Closing Holder to the Holder Representative under the terms of this _Section
11.1_ ;

  



    

 | 73| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) to give and receive all notices, communications and to receive
and accept service of legal process in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding arising under this Agreement or the other related agreements;

  



  

(vi) to act for the Pre-Closing Holders with respect to all
indemnification matters referred to in this Agreement or the other
related agreements, including the right to negotiate and compromise on behalf
of the Pre-Closing Holders any indemnification claim made by or against the
Pre-Closing Holders;

  



  

(vii) to disburse funds or Indemnification Escrow Shares (to the extent
such Indemnification Escrow Shares are released to the Holder
Representative pursuant to the terms of clause (xi) below) to third parties
for expenses and liabilities;

  



  

(viii) to engage, employ and obtain the advice of legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors and rely on their advice
and counsel, and to incur and pay fees and expenses of such advisors on
behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders, in each case following reasonable prior
consultation with the Escrow Stockholders, to the extent practicable;

  



  

(ix) to take or refrain from taking all actions necessary or
appropriate on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders in the sole judgment of
Holder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or required or
permitted by the terms of this Agreement or the other related agreements; and

  



  

(x) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which
such Pre-Closing Holder, or any or all of the Pre-Closing Holders
collectively, are permitted or required to do or exercise under this
Agreement or any related agreement.

  



    

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(xi) The Holder Representative shall have no liability to Acquiror,
the Company, any Pre-Closing Holder or any other holder of Common Stock or
Options, with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in his capacity
as the Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct). The Escrow
Stockholders shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Holder
Representative from and against any loss, liability, damage, claim, costs,
fees or expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment),
and shall advance and reimburse costs, fees and expenses, in each case arising
out of or in connection with the performance of the Holder Representative of
his duties in accordance with their Applicable Percentage (except for those
arising out of the Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Holder
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Pre-Closing Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Pre-Closing Holder. The
Holder Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any
directions, acts, consents, waivers or instructions received from the Escrow
Stockholders (acting unanimously) and shall act in accordance with such
instructions. In the event that the Holder Representative does not receive
unanimous direction from the Escrow Stockholders with respect to a given
contemplated action, he shall have no obligation to take any such action or
any liability with respect to the failure to take such action. If not
paid directly to Holder Representative by the Escrow Stockholders, any such
amounts may be recovered by Holder Representative from the Indemnification
Escrow Shares at such time as remaining shares would otherwise be released to
the Escrow Stockholders pursuant to _Section 12.9_ ; provided, that while
this section allows Holder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned
source of shares, this does not relieve the Escrow Stockholders from their
obligation to promptly pay such amounts as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Holder Representative from seeking any remedies available
to him at law or otherwise. In no event will the Holder Representative be
required (absent his specific agreement to do so, in his sole discretion) to
incur costs, expenses or fees or advance its own funds on behalf of the
Escrow Stockholders or the Pre-Closing Holders, or in any other manner in
connection with the performance of his duties as the Holder Representative.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnity set forth elsewhere in this Agreement
are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Holder
Representative under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the
Closing, the resignation or removal of the Holder Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Holder
Representative shall not have authority to settle any claim in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Shares without the prior written consent of each Pre-
Closing Holder responsible for the payment of any amount in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Shares.

  



  

Section 11.2 _GPIAC-Designated Directors_.

  



  

(a) _Designation the GPIAC Designated Directors._ Prior to the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the board of directors
of Acquiror shall designate two individuals (the " _GPIAC Designated
Directors_ ") to serve as representatives of Acquiror from and after the
First Effective Time and to act on behalf of Acquiror to take all necessary
actions and make all decisions and direct all actions of Acquiror related to
its rights and obligations (and the rights of the Acquiror Pre-Closing Holders
and the GPIAC Indemnified Parties) hereunder and pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement on behalf of Acquiror. In the event of a GPIAC
Designated Director's death, resignation, removal or refusal to serve, then,
if prior to the First Effective Time, the board of directors of Acquiror or,
if following the First Effective Time, the Sponsor, shall designate another
individual as a replacement for such GPIAC Designated Director.

  



    

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Authority and Rights of the GPIAC Designated Directors_. Each
of the GPIAC Designated Directors shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the GPIAC Designated Directors shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Acquiror Pre-Closing Holders, except as
expressly provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the GPIAC Designated Directors shall have full power, authority and
discretion, for and on behalf of the Acquiror Pre-Closing Holders (and as
applicable to the extent provided in this Agreement, on behalf of Acquiror),
to (i) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into amendments to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, (ii) dispute, negotiate, settle and take
other actions as may be required in connection with final calculation and
determination of Closing Date Indebtedness, Closing Date Cash and Closing
Date Unpaid Transaction Expenses, as contemplated in _Section 3.6_ , and
(iii) dispute, negotiate, settle and take other actions as may be required in
connection with _Article XII_ , including in respect of any Specified Co-
Founder Fraud Claims and Specified Pre-Closing Holder Fraud Claims and to
administer the release and cancellation of the Indemnification Escrow Shares
or other disbursement pursuant to Section 14.4 and _Section 12.8_. None of the
GPIAC Designated Directors shall have any liability to Acquiror, the Company
or any holder of Acquiror Common Shares or Acquiror Preferred Shares or
warrants to purchase Acquiror Common Shares or Acquiror Preferred Shares, with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in his or her capacity as a
GPIAC Designated Director as designated hereunder (except for those arising
out of such GPIAC Designated Director's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), but without effect on such GPIAC Designated Director's duties to
Acquiror and its shareholders in his or her capacity as a member of the board
of directors of Acquiror in matters unrelated to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Article XII 
  
 _ INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 12.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. Each representation warranty, covenant and obligation contained
herein and any certificate related to any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation will survive the Closing and continue in full force
and effect for one (1) year after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Expiration
Date_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any covenant contained in this
Agreement that, by its terms, provides for performance following the
Closing Date shall survive until such covenant is performed. No
Indemnification Claim for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in, or otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement (other than
any covenant that provides for performance following the Closing) may be
asserted pursuant to this Agreement unless (i) on or before the Survival
Expiration Date, such claim is asserted by proper written notice in
accordance with this _Article XII_ , specifying, in reasonable detail, the
basis of the claim, and (ii) such claim is made in respect of Damages
specified, in reasonable detail, and incurred prior to the Survival
Expiration Date, or, to the extent arising out of a third party claim
(including any claim by any Governmental Authority) asserted in writing prior
to the Survival Expiration Date, such claim is made in respect of a reasonably
estimated amount of Damages reasonably expected to arise in connection with
such claim.

  



  

Section 12.2 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 12.4_ , from and after the First Effective
Time and until and through the Survival Expiration Date, holders of Acquiror
Common Shares immediately before the First Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Acquiror Pre-Closing Holders_ " or the " _GPIAC Indemnified Parties_ ")
shall be entitled to indemnification from the Indemnification Escrow
Shares for any and all Damages to the extent arising from:

  



    

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty the Company has
made in this Agreement or in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_ (a " _Company Warranty Breach_ ") (provided that any
qualification or exception relating to materiality, material adverse effect
or "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining the amount of any Damages and for purposes of determining whether
such representation or warranty has been breached);

  



  

(ii) any breach by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any covenant or
agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries in this Agreement;

  



  

(iii) any Deficit Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.6_ ;

  



  

(iv) any Pre-Closing Holder's exercise of dissenters' rights; and

  



  

(v) any Legal Proceeding by any Pre-Closing Holder against Acquiror
or the Company, or their respective officers and directors, in each case,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Mergers.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 12.4_ , from and after the First Effective
Time and until and through the Survival Expiration Date, Acquiror
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Holder Representative and the Pre-
Closing Holders (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless
for any and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty Acquiror or Merger Sub has made in this Agreement
or in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ (an "
_Acquiror Warranty Breach_ ") (provided that any qualification or exception
relating to materiality, material adverse effect or Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect shall be disregarded solely for purposes of determining the amount of
any Damages, but not for purposes of determining whether such representation
or warranty has been breached) or (ii) any breach by Acquiror or Merger Sub
of any covenant or agreement of Acquiror or Merger Sub in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party
shall be entitled under this _Article XII_ shall be determined: (i) by the
written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) with
respect to any Deficit Amount, in the manner set forth in _Section 12.3(e)_ ;
(iii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or
(iv) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor
shall agree in writing. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.
The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the
amount of Damages suffered by it.

  



  

Section 12.3 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

  



  

(a) If any Action is commenced or threatened that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by any Person
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the
Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing
in reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Action, (C) including the
Indemnified Party's best estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise
from such Action, and (D) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the
Indemnified Party's Indemnification Claim under this Agreement. Failure to
notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ will not
relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent (1) the defense of such Action is prejudiced by
the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified
Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_  prior to the Survival Expiration
Date.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim
with counsel of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such
Action, and each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the
conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related
claims, counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with
the Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; _provided_
,  _however_ , that (1) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the reasonable
expense of the Indemnitor if (x) so requested by the Indemnitor in writing or
(y) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party,
representation of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor would create a
conflict of interest; _provided_ , that in any such circumstance the
Indemnitor shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim, and (2) the
Indemnitor will not approve of the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to the Indemnification Claim without the
Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor
of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor
notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not, within sixty
(60) days after such notice is given, (i) give notice to the Indemnified
Party of its election to assume the defense of the Action or Actions subject
to such Indemnification Claim and (ii) thereafter promptly assume such
defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such Action;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to the Action or Actions subject to any such Indemnification Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) and (B) if at any time the Indemnitor acknowledges
in writing that such Action is a Damage subject to this _Article XII_ , the
Indemnitor may thereafter assume the defense of such Action.

  



  

(c) If any Indemnified Party becomes aware of any circumstances that
may be reasonably likely to give rise to an Indemnification Claim for any
matter not involving an Action, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i)
notify the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (A)
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the circumstances giving rise to
the Indemnification Claim, (B) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such circumstances, and
(C) describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's
Indemnification Claim under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor
in accordance with this _Section 12.3(c)_ will not relieve the Indemnitor of
any liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent
(1) the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's
failure to give such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the
Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section
12.3(c)_ prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which
the applicable Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted
during normal business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(e) The claim procedures otherwise specified in this _Section 12.3_
shall not apply to indemnification claims in respect of any Deficit Amount.
In the event of a Deficit Amount, as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.6_ , then, promptly following the Determination Date, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, the GPIAC-
Designated Directors and the Holder Representative shall execute a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Acquiror an amount of Acquiror Common Shares equal to (A) (i) the
Deficit Amount, __divided by_ _$10.00; divided _by_  (B) the Closing
Ownership Ratio. Upon receipt of such Acquiror Common Shares from the Escrow
Agent, Acquiror shall promptly cancel such shares.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an
Indemnified Party makes under this _Article XII_ will be limited as follows:

  



  

(a) _Source and Order of Recovery_. If there is determined to be
any amount owing to a GPIAC Indemnified Party as a result of
indemnification under this _Article XII_ , the amount of then-remaining
Indemnification Escrow Shares shall be a GPIAC Indemnified Party's sole
source of recovery with respect to any and all amounts owed to a GPIAC
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XII_ , except in the case of
fraud, in which case:

  



  

(i) in respect of claims against (A) the Company or (B) a Co-
Founder, whether in such Co-Founder's capacity as a Stockholder,
director, officer or employee of the Company, who was perpetrator or had
actual knowledge of fraud (any such claim under clause (A) or clause (B), a "
_Specified Co-Founder Fraud Claim_ "), then (A) Damages shall first be paid
out of the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Shares and (B) if the amount
then-remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Shares is insufficient to satisfy
in full any amount owing to a GPIAC Indemnified Party in respect of such
Specified Co-Founder Fraud Claim, then the GPIAC Indemnified Party shall only
be entitled to recourse directly against the Co-Founders for the amount of
Damages in excess of the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Shares and
shall not be entitled to recourse against any other Pre-Closing Holder in
respect of such Specified Co-Founder Fraud Claim; and

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Pre-Closing Holder (other
than the Co-Founders), whether in such Pre-Closing Holder's capacity as a
Stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Company, was a perpetrator
or had actual knowledge of fraud (" _Specified Pre-Closing Holder Fraud
Claim_ "), then (A) Damages relating to such Specified Pre-Closing Holder
Fraud Claim shall first be paid out of the then-remaining Indemnification
Escrow Shares and (B) if the amount then-remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Shares is insufficient to satisfy in full any amount owing to a GPIAC
Indemnified Party in respect of such Specified Pre-Closing Holder Fraud
Claim, then the GPIAC Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to recourse
directly against such Pre-Closing Holder and the Co-Founders for the amount
of Damages in excess of the then-remaining Indemnification Escrow Shares and
shall not be entitled to recourse against any other Pre-Closing Holder in
respect of such Specified Pre-Closing Holder Fraud Claim; provided that the
Pre-Closing Holder and the Co-Founders shall first satisfy their obligations
to the GPIAC Indemnified Party in excess of the then-
remaining Indemnification Escrow Shares through the delivery of Acquiror
Common Shares then held by such Persons, pursuant to the formula described
below. The amount of any Acquiror Common Shares necessary to satisfy any such
excess shall equal (x) such excess amount of Damages to be satisfied through
the delivery of Acquiror Common Shares _divided by_ $10.00, _divided by_ (y)
the Closing Ownership Ratio. Upon determination of the amount of Acquiror
Common Shares necessary to satisfy any Damages under this

expenses of GPIAC Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with making such
claim under this Agreement) incurred by the GPIAC Indemnified Parties that

(c) _Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds, Tax Benefits and Other
Third-Party Recoveries_. All Damages for which any Indemnified Party
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under this _Article XII_ shall

party recoveries which any Indemnified Party actually receives in respect of
any Damages incurred by such Indemnified Party, net of applicable reserves,

Indemnified Party is entitled to any such insurance proceeds, Tax
benefits, indemnity payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of any
Damages for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XII, such Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize
such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that any such
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries are realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such
Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the
claims to which such insurance proceeds, Tax benefits, indemnity payments or
other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant
portion of such indemnification payment.

indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article XII_ , at the election of
the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of
its claims for recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by
insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.

  



  

(e) _Expenses_. In the event that the Holder Representative assumes
any defense of any Action for which a GPIAC Indemnified Party has sought
indemnification, reasonable expenses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
in connection therewith, including reasonable legal costs and expenses, shall
constitute Damages for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to
which the GPIAC Indemnified Parties shall be entitled pursuant to _Section
12.4(a)_.

  



    

 | 81|

Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any Damages in

balance sheet.

  



  

(h) _No Duplicate Claims_. In the event a GPIAC Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of
an Indemnification Claim, no other GPIAC Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, may recover the same Damages in respect of
an Indemnification Claim under this Agreement.

  



  

(i) _Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement or otherwise, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover Damages, and no equityholder, director, officer or employee of the

Disclosure Letter following the announcement of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Indemnification Claims under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties hereto for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration.

  



  

Section 12.7 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Following the
Closing, except in the case of fraud, indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (other than for specific
performance) of the parties and any parties claiming by or through any party
(including the Indemnified Parties) related to or arising from any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in, or
otherwise pursuant to, this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.8 _Nature of GPIAC Indemnified Parties ' Recovery from
Indemnity Escrow_. Except as otherwise contemplated by _Section 12.4(a)_ ,
the Parties agree recovery by the GPIAC Indemnified Parties for any Damages
(as finally determined pursuant to this  _Article XII_ ) shall be satisfied
from the Indemnification Escrow Shares by Escrow Agent's release to Acquiror,
and upon receipt thereof, Acquiror's prompt cancellation of: an amount of
Acquiror Common Shares equal to (A) such Damages,  _ _divided by_ _$10.00;
_divided by_ (B) the Closing Ownership Ratio.

Section 12.9 _Release of Escrow_. The Escrow Agreement shall specify
that the Indemnification Escrow Shares (if any) shall be released to the
Escrow Stockholders in accordance with such holders' relative Applicable
Percentages on the first Business Day following the Survival Expiration Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim pursuant to this _Article XII_
shall have been properly asserted by any GPIAC Indemnified Party in
accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the Survival Expiration Date
and remain pending on the Survival Expiration Date (any such claim, a "
_Pending Claim_ "), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Shares released to the
Escrow Stockholders shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Shares then
held by the Escrow Agent, _minus_ the aggregate number of Acquiror Common
Shares equal to (A) the amount of such Pending Claim _divided by _ $10.00,
_divided by_ (B) the Closing Ownership Ratio and (ii) any shares that remain
in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date in respect of any such
Pending Claim shall be released to the Escrow Stockholders entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with such holders' relative Applicable
Percentages promptly upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such
Pending Claim. In each case in which this _Section 12.9_ provides for the
release of Indemnification Escrow Shares, each of the GPIAC-Designated
Directors and the Holder Representative shall promptly submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Indemnification Escrow Shares in accordance with this _Section 12.9_ and
the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Article XIII 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 13.1 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Holder
Representative acknowledges that Acquiror is a blank check company with the
powers and privileges to effect a Business Combination. Each of the Company
and Holder Representative further acknowledges that, as described in the
prospectus dated May 19, 2015 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at www.sec.gov,
substantially all of Acquiror assets consist of the cash proceeds of
Acquiror's initial public offering and private placements of its securities
and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in the Trust
Account for the benefit of Acquiror, certain of its public stockholders and
the underwriters of Acquiror's initial public offering. Each of the Company
and Holder Representative acknowledges that it has been advised by Acquiror
that, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account that may be released to Acquiror to pay its franchise tax,
income tax and similar obligations, the Trust Agreement provides that cash in
the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to Acquiror in limited amounts
from time to time in order to permit Acquiror to pay its operating expenses;
(ii) if Acquiror completes the transactions which constitute a Business
Combination, then to those Persons and in such amounts as described in the
Prospectus; and (iii) if Acquiror fails to complete a Business Combination
within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the
Trust Agreement, to Acquiror in limited amounts to permit Acquiror to pay the
costs and expenses of its liquidation and dissolution, and then to Acquiror's
public stockholders. For and in consideration of Acquiror entering into this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
each of the Company and Holder Representative, on behalf of the Pre-Closing
Holders, hereby irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind they have or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust
Account and agree not to seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds
distributed therefrom as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Acquiror; _provided_ that (x)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's and Holder
Representative's right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief
against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of
the transactions (including a claim for Acquiror to specifically perform its
obligations under this Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of
the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Acquiror
Share Redemptions) to the Pre-Closing Holders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Trust Agreement) so long as such claim would not affect
Acquiror's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the Acquiror Share
Redemptions, or for fraud and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit any claims that the Company and Holder Representative may have in the
future against Acquiror's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust Account
and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds).

apparent upon reading the disclosure contained in such section of the
applicable Disclosure Letter, without independent knowledge on the part of the
reader regarding the matter disclosed, that such disclosure is responsive to
such other section of this Agreement or section of the applicable Disclosure
Letter. Certain information set forth in the Disclosure Letters is included
solely for informational purposes and may not be required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall not be

Section 13.10 _Entire Agreement_. (i) This Agreement (together with
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure Letter) and (ii)
that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2017, between

hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may
have been made or entered into by or among any of the parties hereto or any
of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants, understandings,

(a) Any proceeding or action based upon, arising out of or related
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby must be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent such Court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of

District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the parties
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any
such proceeding or action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have
to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all
claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined
only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect
the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to
commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any
action, suit or proceeding brought pursuant to this _Section 13.14_.

  



  

(b) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which

likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such
party hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and voluntarily waives any right
such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 13.15 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific enforcement of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each
party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law, and
each party agrees to waiver any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 13.16 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto
and any express guarantor of any such party's obligations hereunder and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect
to such party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not relieve
(i) any party for liability with respect to fraud committed by such party or
(ii) any Pre-Closing Holder, (including any Co-Founder) for liability with
respect to fraud perpetrated by or actually known to such Pre-Closing Holder,
in accordance with, in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), _Section
12.4(a)_. Except to the extent a named party to this Agreement (and then only
to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in
this Agreement and not otherwise), no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of
the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company or Acquiror under this Agreement (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 13.17 _Conflicts and Privilege_. Acquiror, the Company and
the Holder Representative hereby agree that, in the event a dispute with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby arises
after the Closing between or among Acquiror, the GPIAC Designated Directors
and/or the Sponsor, on the one hand, and the Company, the Pre-Closing Holders,
the Holder Representative and/or the Escrow Stockholders, on the other hand,
any legal counsel (including Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) that
represented Acquiror, the GPIAC Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor prior
to the Closing may represent the GPIAC Designated Directors and/or Sponsor in
such dispute even though the interests of the GPIAC Designated Directors
and/or Sponsor may be directly adverse to the Acquiror, and even though such
counsel may have represented Acquiror in a matter substantially related to
such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Acquiror, the GPIAC
Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor. Acquiror, the Company and the
Holder Representative further agree that, as to all legally privileged
communications prior to the Closing between or among any legal counsel
(including Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP) that represented
Acquiror, the GPIAC Designated Directors and/or the Sponsor prior to the
Closing and any one or more such Persons that relate in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney/client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the GPIAC
Designated Directors and may be controlled by such GPIAC Designated
Directors, and shall not pass to or be claimed or controlled by
Acquiror (after giving effect to the Closing), the Company and the Holder
Representative; provided that the GPIAC Designated Directors shall not waive
such attorney/client privilege other than to the extent they determine
appropriate in connection with the enforcement or defense of their respective
rights or obligations existing under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any privileged communications or information shared by the Company
prior to the Closing with Acquiror, Sponsor or the GPIAC Appointed
Directors (in any capacity) under a common interest agreement shall remain
the privileged communications or information of the Surviving Corporation.
