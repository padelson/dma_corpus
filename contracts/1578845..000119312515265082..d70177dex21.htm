this _Section 2.5_, then Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall enter into such
arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the Parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and
operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such Consent
(provided that, with respect to any such asset that is a Contract, such
obligation shall continue for only so long as the applicable Contract is in
effect). Seller Parent shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon
receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers or
any of its Affiliates in connection with its use of any asset in connection
with the arrangements under this _Section 2.5_. To the extent that Buyer
Parent is provided the benefits of any Transferred Asset, right, benefit or
obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom referred to herein (whether from
Sellers or otherwise) as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained, Buyer
Parent shall arrange to discharge and perform the liabilities and obligations
of Sellers thereunder or in connection therewith, as applicable, to the same
extent as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained.

the Assumed Liabilities (to the extent treated as consideration for the
Acquired Assets for applicable Tax purposes) shall be allocated among the
Acquired Assets consistent with applicable law applied in the manner initially
determined by Seller Parent (the "Global Purchase Price Allocation"). As soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within
ninety (90) days after the purchase price adjustments described in _Section
3.3_ have been determined, Seller Parent shall deliver to Buyer Parent the
Global Purchase Price Allocation for Buyer Parents review and comment. If
Buyer Parent has comments to such proposed Global Purchase Price Allocation,
it shall deliver written notice of such comments to Seller Parent within
thirty (30) Business Days after the delivery of such proposed Global Purchase
Price Allocation, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
comments, with such comments not to be unreasonably rejected by Seller
Parent. 

(b) The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration shall be allocated
among the Acquired Assets consistent with applicable Law, applied in the
manner initially

 



37  determined by Seller Parent (the "Consideration Allocation"). As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within
ninety (90) days after the Closing, Seller Parent shall deliver to Buyer
Parent the Consideration Allocation for Buyer Parents review and comment. If
Buyer Parent has comments to such proposed Consideration Allocation, it shall
deliver written notice of such comments to Seller Parent within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the delivery of such proposed Consideration Allocation,
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such comments, with such
comments not to be unreasonably rejected by Seller Parent.

(c) Any adjustments to any amounts treated as purchase price for applicable
Tax purposes after the Global Purchase Price Allocation has been determined
pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ and any Earn-out Payment shall be allocated
among the Acquired Assets in the manner consistent with the principles set
forth on the Global Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(d) Buyers and Sellers shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed
(including any supplemental filings to reflect any revisions to the Global
Purchase Price Allocation) and issue all necessary invoices consistent with
the Global Purchase Price Allocation, as adjusted for any contingent payments
made pursuant to _Section 2.6_. No Buyer or Seller shall take any
Tax position inconsistent with such Global Purchase Price Allocation and no
Buyer or Seller shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Global Purchase
Price Allocation by any Governmental Authority without first giving the other
party prior written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , if any Governmental
Authority disputes the Global Purchase Price Allocation, the party receiving
notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto, and the
parties shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order
to preserve the effectiveness of the Global Purchase Price Allocation;
_provided_ , _further_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent any Buyer
or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Global Purchase Price
Allocation, and no Buyer or Seller shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging such Global Purchase Price Allocation. Sellers and Buyers shall
deliver to the other, upon reasonable request, if applicable, any draft Tax
Return form reporting results from the Global Purchase Price Allocation for
the others approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each Party shall have fifteen (15) days to approve any
such draft Tax Return.

of this  _Section 2.7_, the following definitions shall apply:

the Lenalidomide Agreement); plus (ii) the share of proceeds (whether cash or
fair market value of all non-cash consideration) received pursuant to any
settlement to be allocated to Arrow pursuant to Clause 8.5 of the Lenalidomide
Agreement minus (iii) any Litigation Costs borne by Arrow in accordance with
the Lenalidomide Agreement minus (iv) any litigation expenses, including

Lenalidomide in the Territory (as defined in the Lenalidomide Agreement);

(v) "Other Lenalidomide" means Lenalidomide, excluding "Product", as defined
in the Lenalidomide Agreement;

(vi) "Other Lenalidomide Net Sales" means (i) gross sales proceeds of Other

(vii) "Total Lenalidomide Net Sales" means Natco Lenalidomide Net Sales and
Other Lenalidomide Net Sales, _provided_ , that in no event shall the amount

the event that the Earn-out Payment would be less than zero for any
particular Earn-out Period, then the absolute value of such negative amount
shall be deducted from future Earn-out Amounts, if any.

 

(b) _Payment_. Buyer Parent will make Earn-Out Payments to Seller Parent under
this _Section 2.7_ on a quarterly basis beginning with the First Earn-Out
Period. Earn-Out Payments due with respect to an Earn-Out Period shall be paid

Period. Each Earn-Out Payment will be accompanied by a report setting forth,
for each month by stock-keeping unit the volume of Lenalidomide sold, the
gross sales proceeds of Lenalidomide and the Lenalidomide Net Sales (broken
down by category) with respect to the applicable Earn-Out Period and, in each
case, to the extent the Buyer Parent or its Affiliates are permitted to give
such information. Any Earn-Out Payments paid to Seller Parent shall be deemed
to be an increase in the Global Purchase Price.

 

(c) _Financial Records; Audits_.

 

(i) The Buyer Parent will, and will procure that the Buyer Group will, keep
complete and accurate financial records in sufficient detail to permit the
Buyer Parent to

 



39  confirm the accuracy of all Earn-Out Payments, and such records will be open
(in such form as may be available or reasonably requested) to inspection for
three (3) years following the end of an Earn-Out Period to which they
pertain. Seller Parent will have the right, at its own expense to have an
independent, certified public accountant, selected by it to perform a review

Parent or its Affiliates are permitted access under the Lenalidomide
Agreement, any financial records provided pursuant to the Lenalidomide

accountant (the "Earn-Out Report") will be made available to both the Buyer
Parent and the Seller Parent promptly upon its completion.

 

(ii) If within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the Earn-Out Report,
Seller Parent or Buyer Parent notifies the other in writing of any
disagreement or difference of opinion relating to the Earn-Out Report (the
"Notice of Disagreement"), the Parties shall be deemed to have accepted the
Earn-Out Report which shall become final and binding on the parties.

(iii) If either Party delivers a Notice of Disagreement in relation to any
Earn-out Report, the Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall negotiate in good
faith to seek to reach agreement on the items and amounts identified in such
Notice of Disagreement, and, if agreement in writing is reached between Seller
Parent and Buyer Parent on all such items and amounts, then any relevant
Earn-out Payments shall be adjusted in accordance with such agreement. If
Buyer and Seller Parent do not reach agreement as to the disagreement or
difference of opinion set out in a Notice of Disagreement, in each case within
twenty (20) Business Days of the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement,
either Buyer Parent or Seller Parent may, by notice to the other, require that
the issues identified in the Notice of Disagreement be referred to the
Reporting Accountants.

 

(iv) Where a dispute is referred to the Reporting Accountants under _Section
2.7(c)(iii)_, the Reporting Accountants shall be engaged by the Seller Parent
and Buyer Parent:

A. on the terms set out in this _Section 2.7_;

 

B. to make a final determination within twenty (20) Business Days of the date
on which the foregoing disputed matters are submitted to it and for this
purpose shall submit a written report to the parties;

C. to give Buyer Parent and Seller Parent reasonable opportunity to make
written representations and require that each of them supply the other with a
copy of any written representations at the same time as they are made;

 

D. to permit each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent to be present while oral
submissions (if any) are being made by the other; 

E. to act as experts (and not as arbitrators) in making their determination
and their determination of any matter falling within their jurisdiction shall
be final and binding on each of Buyer Parent and Seller

 



40  Parent save in the event of manifest error (when the relevant part of their
determination shall be void and the matter shall be resubmitted to the
Reporting Accountants by either party for correction as soon as reasonably
practicable);

F. not be entitled to determine the scope of their own jurisdiction;

 

G. direct how their charges and expenses (including VAT) shall be borne as
they shall direct at the time they make any determination; and

H. otherwise on such terms as shall be agreed between Seller Parent, Buyer
Parent and the Reporting Accountants.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any determination with respect to the
calculation of "Profits" or "Litigation Costs" under the Lenalidomide
Agreement shall be binding on Buyer Parent and Seller Parent for purposes of
this Agreement, provided that any amendment or waiver of the operative
provisions thereof and any agreement by Arrow, Buyer Parent or any Affiliate
of Buyer with respect to the calculation of "Profits" or "Litigation Costs"
pursuant to the Lenalidomide Agreement shall only be binding on Seller Parent
if it has consented thereto.

 

(d) _Covenants_.

(i) Buyer Parent undertakes to Seller Parent to procure that during the Earn-
out Periods the Buyer Group shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with generic pharmaceutical industry practices to maximize the
amount of sales of Lenalidomide.

(ii) Buyer Parent undertakes to Seller Parent not to, and to procure that no
member of the Buyer Group shall, following Closing and during the Earn-out
Periods: (a) agree to any termination of, amendment of, waiver of any
provision of or right under; or (b) take any actions which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a right of Natco Pharma Limited to terminate, the
Lenalidomide Agreement, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Seller Parent.

(iii) Buyer Parent undertakes to Seller Parent to, and to procure each member
of the Buyer Group shall, following Closing and during the Earn-out Periods,
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Lenalidomide
Agreement and shall exercise any right to extend the term of the Lenalidomide
which any member of the Buyer Group may have.

(iv) In the event that Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries disposes of
its rights (whether by way of sale, transfer, license or other disposition)
with respect to Lenalidomide (including by disposing the business of selling
Lenalidomide or any material part thereof), Buyer Parent shall pay to Seller
Parent an amount equal to 50% of the amount received by Buyer Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries from the disposition of such rights, less any expenses
incurred in connection with such transaction. To the extent that the amounts
received in the transaction include non-cash consideration, Buyer Parent and
Seller Parent shall negotiate in

 



41  good faith to agree on the fair value of such non-cash consideration. To the
extent that the amounts received in the transaction include an earnout or
other contingent consideration, Buyer Parent shall pay to Seller Parent an
amount equal to 50% of all such amounts, if and when received.

2.8 _Withholding_. Buyers, Sellers and any of their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and
withheld, from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to
such amounts under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law. Each Party shall provide commercially reasonable notice to
the other Party upon becoming aware of any such withholding obligation and
shall cooperate with such other Party to the extent reasonable to obtain
reduction of or relief from such withholding or deduction. Except as required
by Law, neither Buyers nor any of their respective Affiliates (including any
of the members of the Transferred Group) shall take, or cause to be taken,
any action with respect to any Earn-out Payment that would result in any
additional withholding or deduction (other than resulting from a change in Law
in the jurisdiction from which the Earn-out Payment is made immediately after
the Closing Date) from such Earn-out Payment (any such amounts withheld or
deducted, an "Incremental Withholding"), which would not have resulted absent
a Buyer or any of its respective Affiliates (including any of the members of
the Transferred Group) taking, or causing to be taken, such action. In the
case of any Incremental Withholding resulting from such action, Buyers shall
increase the Earn-out Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
as necessary so that after such Incremental Withholding has been made
(including such withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums
under this _Section 2.8_) the recipient receives an amount equal to the Earn-
out Payment it would have received had no such Incremental Withholding been
made. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

exclusive method for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this provision shall not prohibit either Party from instituting
litigation to enforce any ruling of the Reporting Accountants; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the right to make indemnity
claims hereunder.

(e) Seller Parent shall provide to Buyer Parent and its accountants
reasonable access to the books and records related to the Business and the
Transferred Entities for the period prior to the Closing and to any other
information, including work papers of its accountants (to the extent permitted

or other entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or, where

any other Seller), this Agreement constitutes, and when executed and delivered
by Seller Parent, to the extent Sellers are party thereto, the Ancillary
Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of Sellers,
as applicable enforceable against Sellers in accordance with their respective
terms, except that the enforcement hereof or thereof may be limited by (x)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (y)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Seller Parent has all

material Contract binding on such Seller, or of any applicable Order, and
shall not result in any Lien (other than as may arise as a result of an action
taken, or contract entered into, by Buyers or their Affiliates or other than
Permitted Liens) on any of the Acquired Assets or any Transferred Group
Assets. The Ancillary Agreements, upon their delivery at or prior to Closing,
will have been duly executed and delivered by each Seller that is a party
thereto and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller
that is a party thereto (other than any other Seller), enforceable against
each such Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as
enforceability may be limited or affected by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other Laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect, or materially delay or impair the Transactions, none
of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements by Seller Parent will: (a) result in a material modification,
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) a material default (or give rise to any right, including, but not
limited to, any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration
of any material obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Business Contract; (b) violate in any
material respect any Permit, Regulatory Registration, Order or Law applicable
to the Business or the Acquired Assets or give any Governmental Authority or
other Person the right to challenge any of the Transactions or to exercise any
remedy or obtain any relief under, any Law or any Order to which any Seller or
any of the Acquired Assets, is subject; or (c) result in the imposition or
creation of any Liens upon or with respect to any Acquired Assets or any
Transferred Group.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect, each Transferred Entity Benefit Plan that is an ERISA Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and, to the Seller Parents Knowledge, nothing has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the

50  expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any
Transferred Entity Benefit Plan that is an ERISA Plan, neither the Sellers nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which the Sellers nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or

liabilities did exceed such assets, the amount thereof was properly reflected
on the financial statements of the Sellers or the applicable Subsidiary
previously provided to Buyer Parent, (3) no unsatisfied liability (other than
for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) under Title IV

respects in compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued
by the Internal Revenue Service provided thereunder.

(f) Neither the Sellers nor any ERISA Affiliate have maintained, established,
participated in or contributed to, or is or has been obligated to contribute

former Business Employee, and no Transferred Entity Benefit Plan or other
agreement provides any individual with the right to, a gross up,

or otherwise) becoming due to any current or former Business Employee under
any Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan, or to any other

Except as set forth in Schedule 4.12(b), within the three (3) years preceding
the date hereof, Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries have not received
any written notice, including any warning letter, notice of adverse finding,
or notice of deficiency, or similar communication from the FDA or any other
Governmental Authority, (i) contesting the Regulatory Registrations for the
Labeling and promotion of any of the Products, (ii) alleging that any of the

that any such violation, if any, has not been remedied; except, in each case,
to the extent that such violation has been remedied or that such violation has
not been, and would not be, either individually or in the aggregate, material
to Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries. No Seller or Subsidiary of any
Seller is subject to any enforcement, regulatory or administrative Proceedings
by the FDA or other Governmental Authority alleging that any operation or
activity of Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries relating to the
Business and/or Products is in material violation of any Health Care Law, and,
to Seller Parents Knowledge, no such Proceedings have been threatened. To

filed with any Governmental Authority by Sellers and their respective
Subsidiaries with respect to the Business or any Product have been so
maintained or filed on a timely basis, and were complete and accurate in all
material respects as of the date of filing, or were subsequently updated,
changed, corrected, or modified prior to the date of this Agreement. To
Seller Parents Knowledge, no such filing with any Governmental Authority
contains any materially false, misleading or otherwise inaccurate statements
or information, whether express or due to omission of material information,
as of the date of filing. To Seller Parents Knowledge, no action has been
taken or statements made or failed to be made by either Sellers, their
respective Subsidiaries or an employee, consultant, contractor, agent or
other representative of Sellers with respect to the Business or any Products
that could reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA or other
Regulatory Authority to invoke its Application Integrity Policy or similar
governmental policy or regulation (including non-U.S. policies or
regulations), rule or law.

(d) Except as set forth in  _Schedule 4.12(d)_ and except for those matters
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
during the period of three (3) years immediately preceding the date hereof,
Sellers have not introduced into commercial distribution any Products
manufactured by or on behalf of Sellers which were upon their shipment by
Sellers adulterated or misbranded in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 331 or
equivalent foreign country Health Care Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and except as listed in _Schedule 4.12(d)_, (i) Sellers have
not voluntarily or involuntarily issued or caused to be issued, and to Seller
Parents Knowledge, there are no facts that would require Sellers under any
applicable Health Care Law to issue or cause to be issued, any recall notice,
market withdrawal notice, safety notice, or other 

 



55  similar notice or action disclosing an alleged material defect or lack of
safety or efficacy of any Product and (ii) each Product in current commercial
distribution is designed, manufactured, prepared, assembled, packaged,
Labeled, sterilized, stored, installed, serviced, and processed in compliance
in all material respects with, FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices
regulations as set forth in 21 C.F.R. Parts 210 and 211 and equivalent Health
Care Laws or standards in other jurisdictions.

(e) To the Seller Parents Knowledge, the Sellers and their respective
Subsidiaries have marketed, sold, priced and promoted the Products in material
compliance with all Health Care Law, and Sellers and Sellers Subsidiaries
financial relationships with distributors and customers, including health
care professionals and entities, are maintained, documented and reported in
compliance with all Health Care Law and its policies and procedures regarding
product samples, conflicts of interest, payments and transfers of value,
and remuneration arrangements. To the Seller Parents Knowledge, the Sellers
and their respective Subsidiaries have not made or caused to be made any
bribe, kickback, influence payment, payoff or other unlawful payment to any
Person in the conduct of the Business. With respect to the Business, no
officer or employee of any Seller or Subsidiary of any Seller, or to Seller
Parents Knowledge, no agent of any Seller or Subsidiary of any Seller has:
(A) made any untrue statement of material fact or fraudulent statement to the
FDA or any other Governmental Authority; (B) failed to disclose a material
fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other Governmental Authority;
or (C) committed an act, made a statement, or failed to make a statement that
would reasonably be expected to provide the basis for the FDA to invoke FDAs
policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and
Illegal Gratuities," as set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991),
or any equivalent Health Care Law. To Seller Parents Knowledge, no officer,
employee or agent of Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries has been
convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which debarment is
mandated or permitted by 21 U.S.C. § 335a.

(f) Seller Parent established and maintains a corporate compliance program
that (i) addresses all material requirements of applicable Health Care Laws
and all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the Business, and
(ii) has been structured to account for the guidance issued by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding characteristics of
effective corporate compliance programs. Sellers and their respective
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all Orders to
which they are subject, including any corporate integrity agreement,
including all programmatic, operational and reporting requirements. Each

(ii) any of the issued Patents or the registered Marks are invalid or
unenforceable except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.
To Seller Parents Knowledge, neither the operation of the Business currently
conducted, nor the making, use, import, offer for sale or other disposition of
any Product infringes or misappropriates, or has infringed or misappropriated,
any Intellectual Property of any Person except, in each case, as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(f) To Seller Parents Knowledge, (i) there is no, nor has there been any,
infringement by any Person of any of the material rights of any Seller in or
to the Patents, Licensed Patents, Marks or Licensed Marks or other material
Intellectual Property owned by the Transferred Group, and (ii) there is no,
nor has there been any, misappropriation by any Person of any of the material
Know-How, Manufacturing Instructions or Technical Information.

any Governmental Authority challenging the scope, ownership, validity or
enforceability of the Patents and Marks or, to Seller Parents Knowledge, the
Licensed Patents and Licensed Marks and, to Seller Parents Knowledge, no such

Adverse Effect, Sellers have complied with all applicable Laws and contractual
and fiduciary obligations relating to the collection, storage, use, transfer
and any other processing of any Personally Identifiable Information collected
or used by the Sellers in connection with the Business, in any manner, or to
the Seller Parents Knowledge, maintained by third parties having authorized
access to such information. The Sellers have at all times taken reasonably
necessary steps (including implementing and monitoring compliance with
adequate measures with respect to technical and physical security) to ensure
that all Personally Identifiable Information is protected against loss and
against unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure, and there has
been no unauthorized access to or misuse of such Personally Identifiable
Information.

 

(k) _Schedule 4.16(k)_ sets forth a complete and accurate list to the best of
the Sellers knowledge (corresponding to the following subsections) of (i)

Product for which Seller or any of its Controlled Affiliates potentially could
make a claim of entitlement to 180 days of "first to file" market exclusivity
in accordance with 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(5)(B)(iv).

(l) The consummation of the Transactions will not adversely affect any
Sellers rights to any Transferred Intellectual Property, and all such
Transferred Intellectual Property will be owned or available for use by Buyers
on identical terms and conditions immediately subsequent to the consummation
of the Transactions, without the payment of any additional consideration in
connection therewith except as would reasonably be expected to cause a Seller
Material Adverse Effect.

economic risk of this investment, including complete loss of the investment.

of Seller Parents representations as expressed in this _Section 4.23_.

Consideration may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only
in certain limited circumstances. Seller Parent acknowledges that the Stock
Consideration must be held indefinitely unless a sale of the Stock
Consideration is subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an
exemption from such registration is available. Seller Parent is aware of the
provisions of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act which permit
limited resale of shares purchased in a private placement or shares owned by

certain conditions. Seller Parent is aware that the Stock Consideration is

arrangements, written or unwritten, of any kind, between any Seller or any of

on the one hand, and the Transferred Entities and their Subsidiaries or the
Business, on the other hand (other than the Transferred Receivables or as
otherwise contemplated hereby).

4.27 _Anda Companies_. The business of the Anda Companies is primarily
distribution of products on behalf of the Business, the Retained Business and

a breach of or a default under, any provision of the Organizational Documents
of Buyer Parent, or a material breach or a material default under any material
Contract binding on Buyer Parent, or of any applicable Order. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer Parent, and the Ancillary
Agreements will, at the Closing, be duly executed and delivered by Buyers to
the extent Buyers are party thereto, and, assuming due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery by each other Party thereto (other than
any other Buyer), this Agreement constitutes, and when executed and delivered
by Buyer Parent, to the extent Buyers are party thereto, the Ancillary
Agreements will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyers, as
applicable enforceable against Buyers in accordance with their respective
terms, except that the enforcement hereof or thereof may be limited by (x)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (y)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Buyer Parent has all

under, any provision of the Organizational

 



68  Documents of such Buyer, or a material breach or a material default under
any material Contract binding on such Buyer, or of any applicable Order,
except for such breaches and defaults of Contracts which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions. The Ancillary
Agreements, upon their delivery at or prior to Closing, will have been
duly executed and delivered by each Buyer that is a party thereto and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Buyer that is a
party thereto (other than any other Buyer), enforceable against each such
Buyer in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may
be limited or affected by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or other Laws of general application relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect
(disregarding clause (iv) of the proviso of the definition of Buyer Material
Adverse Effect), or materially delay or impair the Transactions, none of the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements by the applicable Buyer, will: (a) result in a modification,
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time

any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any benefit) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any Contract of Buyer Parent; or (c) violate any Permit,
Regulatory Registration, Order or Law applicable to such Buyer or give any
Governmental Authority or other Person the right to challenge any of the

any Order to which any Buyer is subject.

Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the

under or comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but
would include such liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by Buyer Parent or any Buyer Parent Subsidiary
with any such Law, action, judgment or Contract if such default or failure
would, with or without the giving of notice or passage of time or both,
reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation.

Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any Laws, applicable to Buyer Parent, such Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, except where such non-compliance,

aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

assets, and (b) there are no claims, actions, suits or proceedings pending
(or, to Buyer Parents Knowledge, threatened) against Buyer Parent or any of
Buyer Parents Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, rights or
assets before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of, any
Governmental Authority, which, in the case of clause (a) or (b), would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions or to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect.

and warranties contained in _Article IV_ , Buyer Parent acknowledges that
neither Sellers nor any Representative of Sellers makes, and Buyer Parent
acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any

file (or cause their respective Affiliates to file, as applicable) as soon as
reasonably practicable and advisable, a Notification and Report Form regarding
the Transactions as and to the extent required by the HSR Act (the "HSR
Filing") with each of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") and to promptly submit any other filings required to be made under
any Foreign Antitrust Laws. Each of Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall (and

Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation and to
all inquiries and requests received from any Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust matters and (ii) not extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority to delay the Transactions, except (x) in the case of
Seller Parent, with the prior written Consent of

 



78  Buyer Parent or (y) in the case of Buyer Parent, with prior discussions with
Seller Parent as described in _Section 6.2(b)_. Buyer Parent shall (and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to) offer to take (and if such offer is

eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation
Law that may be asserted by a Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions so as to enable the Closing prior to the Outside Date, and shall
defend through litigation on the merits any Claim asserted in any court by any
Governmental Authority, including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer Parent shall (and shall cause each of its Affiliates to) propose,
negotiate and offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted,

the sale, divestiture, licensing or other disposition of such assets or
businesses of Buyer Parent (or such Affiliates) or of any of the Acquired
Assets, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which
it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to such
action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of Buyer Parent (or such
Affiliates) or of any of the Acquired Assets (any of the foregoing, a
"Divestiture Action"), in each case, to the minimum extent necessary so as to
permit and cause the condition set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_ to be satisfied
by the Outside Date; provided, however, that Buyer Parent shall not be
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to take or commit to take any
Divestiture Action other than (i) with respect to any and all Overlap
Products, and in addition and not in limitation, (ii) such
further Divestiture Actions as would not in the aggregate be of greater
economic significance than the value of the Overlap Products that are not the
subject of a Divestiture Action; provided, however, that this _Section
6.2(a)(ii)_ shall not require Buyer Parent or its Controlled Affiliates to
divest Specialty Products (other than Specialty Products that are Overlap
Products, if any). Each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall promptly
notify the other of any written communication to that party from a
Governmental Authority or any other Person (whether or not a Governmental
Authority) in connection with antitrust matters relating to the Transactions
and, subject to applicable Law, and the instructions of any
Governmental Authority, permit the other to review in advance any material
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing.

(b)  _Cooperation_. Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall jointly control all
communications with any Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust Laws, and
determine and direct the strategy and process by which the Parties will seek
required approvals relating to Antitrust Laws. If the Parties initially
disagree upon any such proposed communication, strategy or process, the
Parties agree to work together in good faith to resolve the disagreement and
endeavor to implement such communication, strategy or process in a mutually
acceptable manner; provided that to the extent that a disagreement is
unresolved after good faith discussions between Siggi Olafsson of Buyer Parent
and Bob Stewart of Seller Parent and other such executive officers as they
may deem appropriate of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, the implementation of
such communication, strategy or process will be controlled by Buyer Parent
after full consideration to the views of Seller Parent. Each of Buyer Parent
and Seller Parent shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of a Party or any of their respective
Affiliates to any Person, including any Governmental Authority, in connection
with the Transactions insofar as they pertain to antitrust matters.

 



79 (c) _Notification_. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Authority, each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by it, or by any of its Affiliates, from any
Person, including any Governmental Authority, with respect to the Transactions
insofar as they pertain to antitrust matters.

 

(d) _Meetings_. Subject to applicable Law, neither Seller Parent nor Buyer
Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall permit any of its
officers or any other representatives or agents to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition
Laws ("Government Antitrust Authority") in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Government Antitrust Authority, gives the
other the opportunity to attend and participate.

(e) _Other Actions_. Without limiting the generality of the undertakings

penultimate sentence in _Section 6.2(a)_, each of the Parties agrees to take
or cause to be taken the following actions: (i) the prompt provision to each
and every foreign, federal, state or local court or any Governmental
Authority of non-privileged information and documents reasonably requested by
any of them or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation
of the Transactions and (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to
avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
Order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions by the
Outside Date. The Parties obligations under this _Section 6.2_ shall include
the obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to defend against any
lawsuits or other legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have
any stay or other injunctive relief which would prevent or impair the
consummation of the Transactions by the Outside Date entered by any court or
other Governmental Authority reversed on appeal or vacated. The Parties agree
that if advisable to facilitate obtaining the Consent of any Governmental
Authority that is a condition to Closing the Agreement, the Parties shall
promptly meet and use their good faith efforts to agree to a modification or
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement
that the Parties agree will facilitate obtaining such Consent provided such
modifications in the aggregate shall not alter the economic values of the
Transactions other than in immaterial respects.

6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
proviso in the penultimate sentence in _Section 6.2(a)_) and without
limiting the express obligations hereunder, each of the Parties agrees to
cooperate fully with each other and to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, at
the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Transactions,
including to obtain all approvals required under applicable Laws, and to
execute and deliver such documents and other papers and any other agreements,
as may be necessary to, as soon as practicable, carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this 

 



80  Agreement. At the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
applicable Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver each Ancillary Agreement, and
Seller shall, and shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, execute
and deliver each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party.

(b) Buyer Parent and Seller Parent agree that promptly following the date of
this Agreement they shall organize a transition team, co-chaired by a
representative of Buyer Parent a representative of Seller Parent and including
equal representation of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, for the purposes of
identifying: (i) services to be provided by Seller Parent to Buyer Parent and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Transition
Services Agreement; and (ii) services to be provided by Buyer Parent to
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries after the Closing pursuant to the terms of
the Reverse Transition Services Agreement and, in each case, the applicable
periods for such services, it being understood that (A) Seller Parent shall
be obligated to provide, or cause to be provided, all services that (I) are
being provided by or on behalf of Seller Parent to the Business as conducted
at any time during the period starting one year prior to the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date (the "Lookback Period") or (II) are
otherwise necessary for the Buyers to operate the Business in the same manner
as conducted at any time during the Lookback Period in all material respects,
(B) Buyer Parent shall be obligated to provide or cause to be provided, all
services that (I) are being provided by or on behalf of the Business to the
Retained Business as conducted at any time during the Lookback Period or (II)
are otherwise necessary for Sellers to operate the Retained Business in the
same manner as conducted at any time during the Lookback Period in all
material respects, based on services provided by the Business to the Retained
Business prior to Closing and Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall identify
any services that are included in the Transferred Assets for which Seller will
need services from Buyer and (C) the fees for such services shall be based
upon the costs of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries in the case of clause
(A), or Buyer Parent and its Subsidiaries in the case of clause (B), to
provide such services with no mark-up or element of profit. Buyer Parent shall
provide transition services to the Retained Business in respect of the
Brand RandD Assets for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing
Date on the pricing terms set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. The
Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon all matters in
the Transition Services Agreement and Reverse Transition Services Agreement.
The cost for all such services shall be determined in the manner set forth in
the Transition Services Agreement or the Reverse Transition Services
Agreement, as applicable. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Parties will
negotiate in good faith and agree on a fair allocation of assets that are
related both to the Business and the Retained Business, with such allocation
to take into account and be based on the relative historical use of such
assets by each business and the allocation of costs associated with such
assets. In the case of any assets of Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries that
are required for the Business but are not included in the Acquired Assets, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer Parent
and its Subsidiaries are granted access or rights to such assets to the extent
required for the Business. In the case of any Acquired Assets that are
required for the Retained Business as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries are granted access or rights to such
assets to the extent required for the Retained Business.

(c) From time to time, as and when requested by a Party, the other Party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at the requesting Partys expense
(except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement), execute such
Transfer Documents (including such instruments of

 



81  assignment as may be necessary in order to have the assignment of the
Transferred Intellectual Property recorded in the name of a Buyer or an
Affiliate of a Buyer at the relevant patent and trademark offices) and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and consummate and evidence the Transactions, including executing and
delivering or causing to be executed and delivered to such Party such
Transfer Documents as such Party or its counsel may reasonably request as
necessary for such purpose.

(d) Prior to Closing, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and agree on
the terms of a distribution arrangement, expiring on December 31, 2016 between
the Business, on the one hand, and the Anda Business, on the other hand,
providing distribution and related services that the Anda Business provided

this Agreement (the "Anda Lookback Period"). The pricing and other terms of
such arrangement shall be on terms at least as favorable to the Business as
during the Anda Lookback Period and reflected in the financial results
contained in the Performance Financial Statement.

 

6.4 _Access; Confidentiality_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each Seller
shall and shall cause its Representatives to, upon reasonable prior notice,
free of charge, give Buyers, their officers, their authorized Representatives
and a reasonable number of their employees, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Business Contracts, Books and Records,
analysis, projections, plans, systems, management and other personnel, the
Sellers Representatives, commitments, offices and other facilities and
properties to the extent related to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
to any information provided to Buyer Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.4_.
The right of Buyers to access pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall not modify
in any way any representation or warranty in _Article IV_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, no Seller shall be required to
provide access to, or to disclose information, where such access or disclosure
would (a) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such Seller, (b)
contravene any applicable Law or (c) give a third party the right to terminate
or accelerate the rights under a contract to which a Seller is a party as of
the date of this Agreement or otherwise bound as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that in each case, Seller Parent shall: (A) give
reasonable notice to Buyer Parent of the fact that it is restricting or
otherwise prohibiting access to any documents or information pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_), (B) inform Buyer Parent with sufficient detail of the reason
for such restriction or prohibition, and (C) cause the applicable Seller to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the documents or information that
are subject to such restriction or prohibition to be provided in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or prohibition.

 

6.5 _Special Contracts_. Between the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the Representatives
of Seller Parent and its Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to
diligently search and identify to Buyer Parent Contracts that contain any non-
compete, exclusivity or similar provision which would restrict the conduct of
the business of Buyer Parent and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Group) post Closing, the Business or the use of the Acquired Assets after
consummation of the Transactions (such terms, "Restrictive Terms" and
such Contract, "Restrictive Contract"). Seller Parent shall promptly notify
Buyer Parent in writing after the identification of such Restrictive Contracts
and include a complete and correct copy of such Restrictive Contract with
the written

 



82  notice (the "Seller Contract Notice"). At the election of Buyer Parent, the
Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Controlled Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) remove Restrictive Terms from the
Restrictive Contracts, (ii) amend such Restrictive Terms to the satisfaction
of Buyer Parent (at its sole discretion) or (iii) if unable to remove or amend
Restrictive Terms to either (a) enter into arrangements to provide to Buyer
Parent the rights, benefits and interests of any such Restrictive Contract and
to the extent the full benefits of any such Restrictive Contract cannot be
provided to Buyer Parent after the Closing, then Seller Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into such arrangements to provide to
Buyer Parent the economic and operational equivalent of such Restrictive
Contract or (b) request Seller Parent to terminate the Restrictive Contract
provided any such termination fees or penalties arising therefrom will be the
sole responsibility of the Buyer Parent.

 

6.6 _Shared Business Contracts_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Shared Business Contracts relate to both
the Business and the Retained Business. Following the Closing, the Parties
desire for themselves and for the benefit of Sellers and Buyers, respectively,
to have and obtain the rights and benefits under each Shared Business Contract
to the extent related to the continuing business of the Buyers and
Sellers. Immediately after the date hereof, the Parties agree to cooperate
together to provide Sellers and Buyers with their applicable rights and
benefits under each Shared Business Contract by assisting the respective
Sellers and/or Buyers in entering into a new Contract or Contracts with the
applicable third party on substantially similar terms (a "Separated
Contract"). The costs of entering into a new Contract or Contract(s) shall be
borne by Seller Parent, in the case of a Shared Business Contract that is a
Business Contract or Buyer Parent, in the case of a Shared Business Contract
that is not a Business Contract. If any Shared Business Contract cannot be
separated into a Separated Contract at Closing, Seller Parent and Buyer
Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, use
their reasonable best efforts to cause, for the period after the Closing until
such Shared Business Contract is separated into a Separated Contract or such
Separated Contract expires pursuant to its terms, (i) the rights and benefits
under each Shared Business Contract to the extent relating to the Business to
be enjoyed by Buyer Parent; (ii) the Liabilities under each Shared Business
Contract to the extent relating to the Business to be borne by Buyer Parent;
(iii) the rights and benefits under each Shared Business Contract to the
extent relating to the Retained Business to be enjoyed by Seller Parent; and
(iv) the Liabilities under each Shared Business Contract to the extent
relating to the Retained Business to be borne by Seller Parent.

(b) Without limiting  _Section 6.6(a)_, if any Shared IP License Agreement
is not separated in accordance with _Section 6.6(a)_, effective as of the
Closing, (i) if such Shared IP License Agreement is a Business Contract, Buyer
Parent shall grant at or prior to Closing (to the extent Buyer Parent or any
member of Buyer Group has a right to, and subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable Shared IP License Agreement), effective as of the Closing
Date, to an entity in the Retained Group designated by Seller Parent, a
perpetual, irrevocable (i) exclusive within the field of brand pharmaceuticals
and (ii) non-exclusive outside the field of brand pharmaceuticals, right and
sublicense under the Shared IP License Agreements and solely for purposes of
developing, manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, distributing,
importing, supporting and otherwise disposing of brand pharmaceutical products
(the "Buyer Licensed Shared IP Sublicenses"). and (ii) if such Shared IP
License Agreement is not a Business

 



83  Contract, Seller Parent shall grant at or prior to Closing (to the extent
Seller Parent or any Retained Entity has a right to, and subject to the terms
and conditions of the applicable Shared IP License Agreements) to an entity
in the Transferred Group designated by Buyer Parent, a perpetual, irrevocable
(i) exclusive within the field of generic pharmaceuticals and (ii) non-
exclusive outside the field of generic pharmaceuticals, right and sublicense
under the Shared IP License Agreements and solely for purposes of developing,
manufacturing, using, selling, offering to sell, distributing, importing,
supporting and otherwise disposing of the Products or any other
generic pharmaceutical product (the Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicenses
and, together with the Buyer Licensed Shared IP Sublicences, the "Licensed
Shared IP Sublicenses"). The Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicenses shall be
non-assignable (provided that such Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicense
shall, to the extent permitted by and consistent with the terms of the
applicable underlying Shared IP License Agreement, be assignable, without the
consent of Buyer Parent, by the applicable Retained Entity (i) to Seller
Parent or any Affiliate of Seller Parent if (A) such Affiliate agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms of such Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicense,
(B) such assignee continues to be an Affiliate of Seller Parent and (C) the
assigning Retained Entity shall remain primarily liable for the performance of
all obligations of such Person under such Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicense
and (ii) to any Person in connection with the sale by Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, as applicable, to such Person of (A) all or a relevant portion of
the Retained Business, whether by merger, consolidation, combination,
reorganization or similar transaction or the transfer, sale,
lease, conveyance or asset sale or (B) the product or products of Seller
Group to which such Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicense relates). The Buyer
Licensed Shared IP Sublicenses shall be non-assignable (provided that such
Buyer Licensed Shared IP Sublicense shall, to the extent permitted by and
consistent with the terms of the applicable underlying Shared IP License
Agreement, be assignable, without the consent of Seller Parent, by the
applicable entity in the Transferred Group (i) to Buyer Parent or any
Affiliate of Buyer Parent if (A) such Affiliate agrees in writing to be bound
by the terms of such Seller Licensed Shared IP Sublicense, (B) such assignee
continues to be an Affiliate of Buyer Parent and (C) the assigning entity in
the Transferred Group shall remain primarily liable for the performance of all
obligations of such Person under such Buyer Licensed Shared IP Sublicense and
(ii) to any Person in connection with the sale by Buyer Parent or its
Affiliates, as applicable, to such Person of (A) the Business, whether by
merger, consolidation, combination, reorganization or similar transaction or
the transfer, sale, lease, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Business or (B) the Product or Products to which
such Buyer Licensed Shared IP Sublicense relates). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 6.6_, nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall
require Buyer Parent to assume any obligation that purports to bind or
restrict any business, activity or asset other than the Business or Acquired
Assets.

 

6.7 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause its Controlled Affiliates to, (i) terminate all
agreements or arrangements, written or unwritten, of any kind (other than any
Ancillary Agreements), between Sellers or any Retained Entity, on the one
hand, and any entity in the Transferred Group, on the other hand, and (ii)
settle or otherwise extinguish any amounts (other than any amounts under any
Ancillary Agreements) owed to or by Sellers or any Retained Entity, on the one
hand, and any entity in the Transferred Group, on the other hand.

 



84 6.8 _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. Within 90 days following the date of this
Agreement, Seller Parent shall deliver to Buyer Parent a draft Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan. Pursuant to the principles set forth on _Exhibit C_ and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (it
being understood that in the event of any inconsistencies or conflicts
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms set forth on _Exhibit C_ ,
the terms of this Agreement shall prevail, except to the extent the Parties
have mutually agreed otherwise in writing), between the date hereof and the
Closing: (x) Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall use their reasonable efforts
to agree a definitive steps plan for the sale and purchase of the Business, in
accordance with the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan, cooperating in good
faith with respect to the transactions set forth in such steps plan; and (y)
Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to, take
such steps as are required to effect the Pre-Closing Reorganization
in compliance in all respects with the terms of _Exhibit C_. The Parties
agree to work together in good faith to finalize and implement the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan in a mutually acceptable manner. Each of Buyer Parent and
Seller Parent shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information reasonably requested in connection with the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan concerning itself, the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable. Seller Parent
shall make any modification to the steps plan referred to in clause (x) of the
previous sentence and the Pre-Closing Reorganization that is reasonably
requested by Buyer Parent ("Buyer-Requested Modifications"). The details of
and the implementation of the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan will be
controlled by Seller Parent after full consideration to the views of Buyer
Parent. Unless a different timing is called for in the Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan, the Seller Parent shall commence all necessary steps to
implement the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan no later than the seventh
Business Day prior to the Closing and shall complete the Pre-
Closing Reorganization Plan by no later than the third Business Day prior to
the Closing.

negotiation of the Ancillary Agreements, the separation of the Shared Business
Contracts contemplated by _Section 6.6_, and the transfer of the Acquired
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities at Closing, prior to
the Closing, Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall establish a committee (the
"Transaction Committee") to be managed by Siggi Olafsson of Buyer Parent and

85  transactions contemplated hereby, including transitional plans of the Buyer
Group and the Seller Group following the Closing, to the extent not in
violation of applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of
information and other laws regarding competition.

(b) If the Parties disagree upon any matter subject to the oversight of the
Transaction Committee, the members of the Transaction Committee shall work
together in good faith to resolve the disagreement in a mutually acceptable
manner. In the event that the Transaction Committee is unable to resolve
such disagreement in a timely manner, and in any event within 5 days of
written notice of such disagreement by one Party to the other, the matter in
dispute shall be elevated to Siggi Olafsson of Buyer Parent and Bob Stewart of
Seller Parent for further good faith discussion, and, if they are unable to
resolve such disagreement within an additional 5 days, to the Chief Executive
Officers of each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent. During the course of all
such discussions, the Parties shall cooperate with each other and all
reasonable requests made by one Party to the other for information, including
requests for copies of relevant documents, will be honored. In the event that
any disagreement is not resolved by the Parties within 15 days following
delivery of the written notice mentioned above, the Parties may seek any
remedies to which they may be entitled in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall prevent either Party from
initiating proceedings in accordance with this Agreement if such Party would
be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that such good
faith efforts are being made to resolve the disagreement through negotiation
or if the consummation of the Transactions would reasonably be expected to be
delayed. In the event that any proceeding is commenced under this _Section
6.9(b)_, the Parties agree to continue to attempt to work in good faith to
resolve any disagreement according to the terms of this Section 6.9 during
the course of such proceeding.

ARTICLE VII

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

7.1  _Principles_. The Parties intend that the Transactions shall result in
the Transferred Entities retention of each Transferred Entity Benefit Plan
(together with all corresponding assets and Liabilities). Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall take all necessary actions to cause (1) any Excluded
Liabilities under the Transferred Entity Benefit Plans or with respect to Non-
Business Employees to be transferred to and assumed by Sellers (other than the
Transferred Entities) and (2) all assets related to Assumed Liabilities under
Transferred Entity Benefit Plans or with respect to Business Employees or, to
the extent specified in _Section 2.3(f)_, Former Business Employees, to be
transferred to the Transferred Entities. To the extent any Assumed Liability
or Excluded Liability cannot be transferred to or from, respectively, a
Transferred Entity due to applicable Law, the Parties will work together in
good faith to provide for a transfer of an equivalent value in cash or other
mutually agreed upon form. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer Parent may meet
its obligations pursuant to this Article 7 under the Transferred Entity
Benefit Plans or under new or existing Benefit Plans of Buyer, in Buyer
Parents sole discretion.

7.2 _Transfer of Employees_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall take all
necessary actions to cause (1) the employment of any Business Employee who is
employed by the Sellers

 



86  and their Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Group) currently employed
at an entity other than a member of the Transferred Group to be transferred to
a member of the Transferred Group and (2) the employment of any Non-Business
Employee who is employed by a member of the Transferred Group to be
transferred to an entity other than a member of the Transferred Group. Seller
Parent shall be responsible for any severance obligations that arise as a
result of such transfer (or termination) and shall be solely responsible for,
and shall indemnify and hold Buyer Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) harmless from all Liabilities concerning the Non-
Business Employees whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing. Prior
to Closing, Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall work together to determine
the exact list of Business Employees.

 

7.3 _Compensation and Benefits_. Effective as of the Closing and through the
first anniversary of the Closing, or such longer period as required by
applicable Law, Buyer Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to
provide, to the Business Employees who continue to be employed by Buyer Parent
or an Affiliate thereof immediately following the Closing (the "Continuing
Employees"), (i) a base salary or wage rate that is not less than the base
salary or wage rate in effect for each such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) annual cash bonus and long-term incentive
opportunities (including any equity awards) which may be payable in cash that,
in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those in effect for each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) employee
benefits (including defined benefit pension benefits) that are, in the
aggregate, no less favorable than those (including pursuant to a defined
benefit plan) provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing and (iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the
greater of (A) the severance benefits that would have been applicable to the
Continuing Employees under a Seller Benefit Plan or a Transferred Entity
Benefit Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing (excluding
change in control severance benefits other than change in control severance
benefits triggered prior to the Closing pursuant to previous transactions by
or with Seller Parent or its Affiliates), or (B) the severance benefits
applicable to similarly-situated employees of Buyer Parent or its Affiliates.

7.4 _Service Credit_. Effective as of the Closing and thereafter, Buyer
Parent shall provide, or shall cause an Affiliate to provide, that periods of
employment with a member of the Transferred Group (including any current or
former Affiliate of a member of the Transferred Group or any predecessor of a
member of the Transferred Group) shall be taken into account for vesting and
eligibility and level of benefits purposes under all employee benefit plans
maintained by Buyer Parent or Affiliate thereof for the benefit of
the Continuing Employees, including vacation or other paid-time-off plans or
arrangements, 401(k), pension or other retirement plans and any severance or
health or welfare plans (other than for purposes of determining any accrued
benefit under any defined benefit pension plan or as would result in a
duplication of benefits).

7.5 _Welfare Plans_. Effective as of the Closing and thereafter, Buyer Parent
shall make commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause its Affiliates to,
(i) ensure that no eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements
or pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect
to the Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits
plan of Buyer Parent or any Affiliate thereof (except to the extent applicable
under Seller Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing), (ii) waive any
and all evidence of insurability requirements with respect to such Continuing
Employees to the extent such evidence

 



87  of insurability requirements were not applicable to the Continuing Employees
under the Seller Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii)
credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket
or other co-payments paid by such employee under the Seller Benefit Plans
prior to the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs for the
purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied
his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket
maximum under any health benefit plan of Buyer Parent or an Affiliate thereof
for such year. The Transactions shall not affect any Continuing
Employees accrual of, or right to use, in accordance with applicable policy
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, any personal, sick, vacation or
other paid-time-off accrued but unused by such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing. 

7.6 _Labor and Employment Law Matters_. Sellers and Buyer Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to take all steps, on a
timely basis, as are required under applicable Law to notify, consult with or
negotiate the effect, impact or timing of the Transactions with each works
council, union, labor board, employee group or Governmental Authority
where so required under applicable Law. Sellers and Buyer Parent shall, and
shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with all applicable Laws,
directives and regulations relating to the Business Employees. Buyer Parent or
its applicable Affiliate shall become a party to any collective bargaining
(including national, sector or local), works council or similar agreement with
respect to any Business Employee. Buyer Parent shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, join any industrial, employer or similar association or
federation if membership is required for the currently applicable collective
bargaining, works council or similar agreement to continue to apply.

 

7.7 _Defined Contribution Plans_. Buyer Parent shall cause each Continuing
Employee who is a participant in a Seller Benefit Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code that includes a cash or deferred arrangement
intended to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Seller
401(k) Plans") to be allowed to participate, effective as of the Closing, in
a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and
maintained by Buyer Parent or an Affiliate thereof (the "Buyer Parent 401(k)
Plan") and such Continuing Employee shall be credited with eligibility service
and vesting service for all periods of service with Sellers or their
respective Affiliates to the extent so credited with such service under the
applicable Seller 401(k) Plan. In addition, Buyer Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Parent 401(k) Plan to
accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) from the
Seller 401(k) Plan.

7.8 _Communications_. Prior to making any written or oral communications to
the directors, officers or employees of the Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected
by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller Parent shall
provide Buyer Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Buyer Parent
shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and Seller Parent shall consider any such comments in good
faith.

 



88 7.9 _Treatment of Business Employee Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each Seller Parent Option granted prior to the date of this Agreement (or
which is a Permitted Award) that is outstanding and unvested and held by a
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing shall be assumed by Buyer
Parent and shall be converted into an option (a "Buyer Parent Option") to
acquire (A) that number of shares of Buyer Parent Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
number of shares of Seller Parent Stock subject to such Seller Parent Option
immediately prior to the Closing by (2) the Exchange Ratio, (B) at an exercise
price per shares of Buyer Parent Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share
of Seller Parent Stock of such Seller Parent Option by (2) the Exchange Ratio;
provided, however, that each such Seller Parent Option (I) which is an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and (II) shall be adjusted in a manner
which complies with Section 409A of the Code and that causes the resulting
Buyer Parent Option not to constitute the grant of a new option or a change in
the form of payment of an option, as provided under Treasury Regulation
section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section
7.9_, each such Buyer Parent Option assumed and converted pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the corresponding Seller Parent
Option immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) As of the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each outstanding and unvested Seller Parent Restricted Share Award granted
prior to the date of this Agreement (or which is a Permitted Award) held by a
Business Employee shall be assumed by Buyer Parent and shall be converted into
an award of restricted stock corresponding to Buyer Parent Stock (each, a
"Buyer Parent Restricted Share Award") with respect to a number of shares of
Buyer Parent Stock (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the applicable number of shares of
Seller Parent Stock subject to the Seller Parent Restricted Share Award as of
immediately prior to the Closing by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
otherwise provided in this  _Section 7.9_, each Buyer Parent Restricted
Share Award assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding Seller Parent Restricted Share Award immediately
prior to the Closing.

(c) As of the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each outstanding and unvested Seller Parent RSU Award granted prior to the
date of this Agreement (or which is a Permitted Award) held by a Business
Employee that vests solely based on the passage of time shall be assumed by
Buyer Parent and shall be converted into an award of restricted stock units
corresponding to Buyer Parent Stock (each, a "Buyer Parent Time-Vesting RSU
Award") with respect to a number of shares of Buyer Parent Stock (rounded up
or down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the applicable number of shares of Seller Stock subject to the
Seller Parent RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Closing by (B) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.9_, each
Buyer Parent Time-Vesting RSU Award assumed and converted pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the corresponding Seller Parent RSU Award
immediately prior to the Closing.

 



89 (d) As of the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each outstanding and unvested Seller Parent RSU Award granted prior to the
date of this Agreement (or which is a Permitted Award) held by a Business
Employee that vests subject to the achievement of one or more performance
goals shall be assumed by Buyer Parent and shall be converted into an award
of restricted stock units corresponding to Buyer Parent Stock (each, a "Buyer
Parent Performance RSU Award"). Each performance goal applicable to any such
Seller Parent RSU Award shall be deemed achieved as of the Closing Date at
the greater of (i) the target performance goal and (ii) the level achieved
based on actual performance through the Closing Date (assuming that the
Closing Date is the last day of the applicable performance period), and the
number of shares of Seller Parent Stock covered by such Seller Parent RSU
Award as of immediately prior to Closing shall be determined in accordance
with this sentence. Each Buyer Parent Performance RSU Award shall cover a
number of shares of Buyer Parent Stock (rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the applicable
number of shares of Seller Parent Stock subject to the Seller Parent RSU Award
as of immediately prior to the Closing (determined in accordance with the
immediately prior sentence) by (B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 7.9_, each Buyer Parent Performance RSU Award
assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions, including any time-
vesting conditions (but not performance-vesting conditions), as applied to the
corresponding Seller Parent Performance RSU Award immediately prior to the
Closing.

(e) As of the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each outstanding and unvested Seller Parent Cash Incentive Award granted prior
to the date of this Agreement (or which is a Permitted Award) held by a
Business Employee that vests subject to the achievement of one or
more performance goals shall be assumed by Buyer Parent (each, a "Buyer Cash
Incentive Award"). Each performance goal applicable to any such Seller Parent
Cash Incentive Award shall be deemed achieved as of the Closing Date at the
target performance goal, and the cash award payable pursuant to such Seller
Parent Cash Incentive Award as of immediately prior to Closing shall be
determined in accordance with this sentence. Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 7.9_, each Buyer Parent Cash Incentive Award assumed pursuant
to this _Section 7.9_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions, including any time-vesting conditions (but not
performance-vesting conditions), as applied to the corresponding Seller
Parent Cash Incentive Award immediately prior to the Closing.

(f) [Reserved].

 

(g) To the extent the assumption and conversion of the Seller Parent Incentive
Awards cannot be effected under the Buyer Parents equity incentive plans in
the manner contemplated by this _Section 7.9_, or as otherwise determined by
Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent shall grant an award of equivalent value (based on
the value of the Seller Parent Incentive Award on the Closing Date and, in
the case of Seller Parent Options, the spread value) with the same payment and
vesting terms and conditions.

7.10 _Annual Bonuses_. Notwithstanding anything in the applicable Seller
Benefit Plans and/or Transferred Entity Benefit Plans to the contrary, to the
extent the Closing Date occurs prior to payment of the 2015 annual cash
bonuses and 2015 annual cash incentive payments to

 



90  the Business Employees under any such Seller Benefit Plans and/or
Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, payment of the 2015 annual cash bonuses and
cash incentive payments shall be made to the Business Employees by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, but in no event later than March 15, 2016. In the event the
Closing occurs during 2016, Buyer Parent and its Affiliates shall provide
full year annual bonuses to the Continuing Employees under bonus plans
maintained by Buyer Parent and/or its Affiliates in a manner consistent with
Section 7.3 of this Agreement. The payment of the 2015 annual cash bonuses and
2015 annual cash incentive payments shall constitute a Current Liability

7.11 _2016 Annual Equity Awards_. In the event the Closing occurs before
December 31, 2016, Buyer Parent and its Affiliates shall provide full year
2016 equity incentive opportunities under equity incentive plans maintained by
Buyer Parent and/or its Affiliates in a manner consistent with Section 7.3 of
this Agreement, with such grants to be made at the later of (i) such time as
Buyer Parent regularly grants 2016 annual long-term equity awards and (ii)
within 30 days following the Closing. In the event Closing does not occur
before December 31, 2016, Seller may grant 2016 equity awards to Business
Employees in the Ordinary Course of Business in aggregate and per person
amounts consistent with 2015 (and such awards will constitute Permitted
Awards).

 

7.12 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon
any Continuing Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of
Buyer Parent or any Affiliate of Buyer Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Buyer Parent or any Affiliate of Buyer
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided
otherwise in a written agreement between Buyer Parent, a member of the
Transferred Group or any Affiliate thereof and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an
amendment or other modification of any Seller Benefit Plan, or (ii) create any
third party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or
its affiliates (or any beneficiaries, dependents or collective bargaining
representative thereof).

ARTICLE VIII

 

TAX MATTERS

8.1 _Tax Returns_. Buyer Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired
Assets, any member of the Transferred Group and the Business after the
Closing, and such Tax Returns, if relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period to the extent they relate to the Acquired Assets, any member
of the Transferred Group and the Business, shall be prepared consistent with
past practices except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Buyer Parent
shall deliver or cause to be delivered any such Tax Returns that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period to Seller Parent for its review at
least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date for filing, and Seller
Parent shall provide written notice of its comments at least fifteen (15)
calendar days prior to filing, such comments not to be unreasonably rejected
by Buyer Parent. Notwithstanding 

 



91  anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.1_, Seller Parent shall file
any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period with
respect to a member of the Transferred Group for any taxable period during
which such member joins a Seller as a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group, and such Tax Returns, to the extent they relate to
the Acquired Assets, any member of the Transferred Group and the Business
(any such portion of such Tax Returns, a "Component Return"), shall be
prepared consistent with past practices except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Seller Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered any
Component Returns that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period
to Buyer Parent for its review at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
due date for filing, Buyer Parent shall provide written notice of its
comments at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to filing, such comments
not to be unreasonably rejected by Seller Parent.

 

8.2 _Tax Proceedings_. From and after the Closing, Buyer Parent shall notify
Seller Parent in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including any member of the Transferred Group) of
notice, with respect to a Pre-Closing tax Period or a Straddle Period, of (i)
any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments that may give rise to
Liabilities for Taxes and (ii) any Claims that may give rise to amounts, in
each case of (i) and (ii), for which Sellers could reasonably be expected to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 12.2_ or which
would otherwise reasonably be expected to result in material adverse Tax
consequences to a Seller (a "Tax Contest Claim"), provided that any failure to
comply with this provision shall not affect any Buyer Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure does not
materially prejudice Seller Parents ability to defend against such Tax
Contest Claim. Sellers shall notify Buyer Parent in writing within thirty (30)
days of receipt by any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller of notice of any
pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment or other Proceeding regarding (x)
the Acquired Assets (y) any member of the Transferred Group and (z) the
Business, provided that any failure to comply with this provision shall not
affect any Seller Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure does not materially prejudice Buyer Parents ability
to defend against such audits, assessments, and Claims. Seller Parent shall,
at its own cost and expense, control the defense employing counsel of its
choice of any Tax Contest Claim to the extent that such Tax Contest Claim
would not reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Tax
liability of Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any member of
the Transferred Group), provided that Seller Parent shall keep Buyer Parent
reasonably informed of the progress of any such Tax Contest Claim (and permit
Buyer Parent to participate in such Tax Contest Claim at Buyer Parents own
expense) and shall not agree to any settlement without receiving the Buyer
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent a Tax Contest Claim would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Tax liability of
Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any member of the Transferred
Group), Buyer Parent shall, at its own cost and expense, control the defense
employing counsel of its choice, provided that (A) Buyer Parent shall use its
best efforts to separate the issues in all material respects into those for
which the Sellers would be liable under _Section 12.2_ or which would
otherwise reasonably be expected to result in material adverse Tax
consequences to the Seller and all other issues and (B) Seller Parent (along
with counsel and other advisors of its choice) shall be entitled to
participate at their sole cost and expense in the defense with respect to the
issues for which the Sellers would be liable under _Section 12.2_ or which
would otherwise reasonably be expected to result in material adverse Tax
consequences to the Seller. From and after the Closing, neither Buyer Parent
nor

 



92  any of its Affiliates (including any member of the Transferred Group) shall
agree to settle any Tax Contest Claim that would reasonably be expected to be
the subject of indemnification by the Sellers under _Section 12.2_ or which
would otherwise reasonably be expected to result in material adverse Tax
consequences to the Seller without the prior written consent of the Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

8.3 _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer Parent and Seller Parent agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to the other, if reasonably requested, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets,
Assumed Liabilities, any payment made under this Agreement, and the receipt
and ownership of the Stock Consideration by the Sellers, including access to
books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns by any Buyer or Seller as provided herein, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
Governmental Authority and the prosecution or defense of any Proceeding
relating to any Tax (subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_ ).
Any expenses incurred in furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to
this _Section 8.3_ shall be borne by the party requesting it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.3_, no Buyer
shall be entitled to review any Tax Return that a Seller joins as a member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group except to the extent
that such Tax Return relates to a member of the Transferred Group and no
Seller shall be entitled to review any Tax Return that a Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any member of the Transferred Group) joins as a member
of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group except to the extent
that such Tax Return relates to a member of the Transferred Group and would
reasonably be expected to be the subject of indemnification by the Buyers
under  _Section 12.3_.

8.4 _Post-Closing Conduct_. After the Closing, except as required under
applicable Law, Buyer Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of
its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, any member of the Transferred
Group) to (i) make, change or revoke any Tax election with respect to the
Acquired Assets or any member of the Transferred Group that has any
retroactive effect in the portion of any Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or
prior to the Closing, (ii) grant an extension of any applicable statute of
limitations that relates to Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets
that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) amend or cause to be amended
any Tax Return of any member of the Transferred Group that relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (iv) take any action on the Closing Date after the Closing
that is outside the Ordinary Course of Business of any member of the
Transferred Group, or (v) fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Puerto Rico Grant, in each case that would reasonably be expected to
materially increase the Liability of Sellers for Taxes (including by
decreasing the amount of any credits or deductions otherwise available to
Sellers), without the prior written consent of the Seller Parent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

 

8.5 _Section 338 Elections_. No Buyer shall make or cause to be made any
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any analogous provisions of state,
local or non-United States income Tax Law) with respect to the purchase of any
member of the Transferred Group by any Buyer without the prior written consent
of Sellers, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Sellers.
A Buyer shall make or cause to be made any election under Section 338 of the
Code (or any analogous provisions of state, local or non-United States income
Tax Law) with respect to a member of the Transferred Group as is reasonably
requested by Seller Parent (a "Seller-Requested Section 338 Election"),
provided that a Buyer shall not be required to make any such election unless,
in Buyer Parents reasonable judgment, such election is not contrary to
applicable Law.

 



93 8.6 _Property Taxes_. Seller Parent (or its applicable Affiliate) shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of Property Taxes levied with respect to
the Acquired Assets that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period as
described in the definition of "Straddle Period," and Buyer Parent (or its
applicable Affiliate) shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
Property Taxes levied with respect to the Acquired Assets that is attributable
to the Post-Closing Tax Period, as described in the definition of "Straddle
Period." Upon receipt of any bill for such Property Taxes, Buyer Parent (or
its Affiliate) or Seller Parent (or its Affiliate), as applicable, shall
present a statement to the other Party setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which each is entitled under this Section 8.6 together with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration
amount. The undisputed proration amount shall be paid by the Party owing it to
the other Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement. In
the event that Buyer Parent (or its Affiliate) or Seller Parent (or its
Affiliate) makes (or causes to be made) any payment for which it is entitled
to reimbursement under this Section 8.6, the applicable Party shall make such
reimbursement promptly but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the
presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which
the presenting Party is entitled along with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement.

8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, transfer (including German and United Kingdom
stamp duty land tax and any other real estate transfer tax), stamp, excise,
consumption, documentary, filing, notarization, registration, land value
gains, recordation and other similar Taxes (but not including VAT) together
with any notarial and registry fees and recording costs ("Transfer Taxes")
resulting from the Pre-Closing Reorganization shall be borne one hundred
percent (100%) by Sellers (the "Non-Shared Transfer Taxes"). All Transfer
Taxes resulting from the transfer by Sellers of the Acquired Assets to
Buyers, including the transfer of the Regulatory Registrations and the
Transferred Intellectual Property (collectively, "Shared Transfer Taxes"),
shall be borne fifty-percent (50%) by Buyers and fifty-percent (50%) by
Sellers _provided_ , that interest, additions and penalties that arise as a
result of a Persons failure to timely and properly pay its portion of the
Transfer Taxes shall be borne exclusively by such Person. In the event one
Party (or its Affiliate) receives a refund or credit of Shared Transfer Taxes
paid pursuant to this _Section 8.7_, such Party (or its Affiliate) shall
remit to the other Party (or its Affiliate) an amount equal to fifty-percent
(50%) of the refund or credit received, and in the event Buyer (or its
Affiliate) receives a refund or credit of Non-Shared Transfer Taxes paid
pursuant to this _Section 8.7_, Buyer (or its Affiliate) shall pay an amount
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the refund or credit received to
Seller. Sellers shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns with respect
to any Transfer Taxes, and each Buyer agrees to cooperate with Sellers in the
filing of any such Tax Returns with respect to the Shared Transfer Taxes,
including by promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary for the Sellers to complete such Tax Returns.

 

8.8 _VAT on the Acquired Assets_. All VAT shall be handled as follows:

 

(a) Subject to _Section 8.8(c)_ below, for those jurisdictions that have
adopted Art. 19 and Art. 29 of the VAT Directive or, for non EU countries, a
Law to the same effect, the

 



94  Sellers and the Buyer agree that they shall use their reasonable endeavors
to ensure that the transfer of Acquired Assets is treated as a "transfer of a
totality of assets or part thereof" (in the UK a "transfer of a business as a
going concern") in line with Art. 19 and Art. 29 of the VAT Directive or, for
non EU countries, a Law to the same effect, such that no supply of goods or
services will take place and the transfer will be out of the scope of the
relevant VAT Law, provided that if the relevant Tax authority asserts that
Art. 19 or Art. 29 does not apply and such transfer of Acquired Assets is a
taxable transaction in line with Title IV of the VAT Directive or, for non EU
countries, a Law to the same effect, paragraph (b) below shall apply to such
transfer of Acquired Assets.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 8.8(c)_ below, for those jurisdictions that have not
adopted Art. 19 or Art. 29 of the VAT Directive or, for non EU countries, a
Law to the same effect, Sellers and Buyers shall agree to a just and
reasonable allocation of the portion of the Global Purchase Price minus the
Seller Payment, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.3_, and plus Assumed
Liabilities corresponding to each particular jurisdiction treating the
transfer as a taxable transaction. Such allocation shall be the VAT exclusive
consideration for the Acquired Assets in such jurisdiction and VAT shall (to
the extent applicable) be payable by the relevant Buyer in addition to such
consideration (unless the transfer of the Acquired Assets is subject to a
reverse charge scheme in line with Art. 194 et seq. of the VAT Directive or,
for non EU countries, a Law to the same effect), upon delivery of a valid VAT
invoice. Where the allocation in a particular jurisdiction is further
increased, Buyer Parent shall pay, on behalf of the relevant Buyer (where
appropriate), to Seller Parent, on behalf of the relevant Seller (where
appropriate), an amount equal to any additional VAT that becomes due as a
result of such increase, with payment to be made by Buyer Parent, on behalf of
the relevant Buyer (where appropriate), on receipt of a valid VAT invoice
and where the allocation in a particular jurisdiction is further decreased,
Seller Parent, on behalf of the relevant Seller (where appropriate), shall
issue a VAT credit note or equivalent to Buyer Parent, on behalf of the
relevant Buyer (where appropriate), and shall, to the extent the excess VAT
is actually recovered by it or a member of a group to which it belongs for VAT
purposes, or is creditable by a Seller against any VAT liability of a Seller
or a member of a group to which it belongs for VAT purposes, pay such excess
VAT together with any interest to Buyer Parent on behalf of the relevant Buyer
(where appropriate). For the avoidance of doubt, any allocation pursuant to
this _Section 8.8_ shall be consistent with the allocation provisions set
forth in _Section 2.6_, so far as possible under applicable Law.

(c) The Sellers and the Buyers shall use their reasonable endeavors to ensure
that the transfer of the Transferred Shares is treated as exempt for VAT
purposes in compliance with the principles of Art. 135(1)(f) of the VAT
Directive or, for non-EU countries, of a Law to the same effect.

(d) In case any Seller is required, in order to satisfy the statutory
requirements of the relevant jurisdiction, or may in order to enable Buyers
to recover any applicable VAT, to supply the relevant Buyer with an invoice
drawn up in compliance with the principles of Title XI, Chapter 3 of the VAT
Directive or, for non EU countries, of a Law to the same effect, Seller shall
do so.

 



95 8.9 Notwithstanding this Article VIII or any other provision of this
Agreement, neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable
for any Taxes related to any actions, elections, or transactions entered into
by any of the Buyers.

 

8.10 _Tax-Sharing and Procedures Agreement_. Prior to Closing, the Parties
shall enter into an agreement which provides for the allocation, sharing,
indemnity, and reimbursement of, as well as the conduct of procedures related
to, Taxes (including related to claims and payments with respect to claims for
UK Group Relief purposes) amongst the Transferred Entities and the other
members of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which a
Transferred Entity and a Seller are members (the "Tax-Sharing and Procedures
Agreement"). The allocations and procedures provided for under the Tax-
Sharing and Procedures Agreement shall be consistent with the principles set
forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1552-1(a)(1) and this Agreement
(including Sections 8.2 and 8.3) and, subject to being on arms length terms,
UK Group Relief legislation.

ARTICLE IX

is prosecuting, participating in, contesting or defending any Proceeding,
whenever filed or made, in connection with or involving (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) the

all at the sole cost and expense (not including employee compensation and

Party. The covenants in this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be deemed to limit
the access and cooperation to be provided to Sellers or Buyers pursuant to
_Section 6.4_ or _Section 9.1(a)_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.1_ shall not provide any
Buyer or Seller (or Representative of any thereof) any access rights to
documents or information of the other Party which access would violate any
Laws or obligations regarding the confidentiality thereof (unless any such
violation could be and is avoided by the recipients execution and
delivery of an appropriate confidentiality agreement), or waive any attorney-
client, work product, or like privilege, or for the purpose of use in
connection with potential or actual litigation, arbitration or mediation
between any Buyer or any Affiliate of any Buyer, on the one hand, and any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller, on the other hand (nor, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall any Buyer or any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates have any right to use any document or information obtained from
the other pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ in any such Proceeding).

9.2 _Privileged Matters._

 

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that: (i) each party and its Affiliates has
or may obtain Privileged Information; (ii) there are and/or may be a number
of Litigation Matters affecting both of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent; (iii)
both Buyer Parent and Seller Parent have a common legal interest in Litigation
Matters, in the Privileged Information and in the preservation of the
confidential status of the Privileged Information, in each case relating to
the Business; and (iv) both Buyer and Seller intend that the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and any
transfer of Privileged Information in connection therewith shall not operate
as a waiver of any potentially applicable privilege.

(b) Following the Closing, each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent agrees, on
behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, not to disclose or otherwise
waive any privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the
Business without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall not be withheld, conditioned or
delayed if the other party certifies that such disclosure is to be made in
response to a likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar action;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to give any such notice or
obtain any such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with respect
to Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates solely to
the Transferred Business (unless such information relates to matters for which
Seller may have indemnification obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements). In the event of a disagreement

 



97  concerning the reasonableness of withholding such consent, no disclosure
shall be made prior to a resolution of such disagreement by a court of
competent jurisdiction, provided that the limitations in this sentence shall
not apply in the case of disclosure required by Law and so certified as
provided in the first sentence of this paragraph.

 

(c) After the Closing, upon receipt of any subpoena or other compulsory
disclosure notice from a court, other governmental agency or otherwise which
requests disclosure of Privileged Information relating to the Transferred
Business, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller Parent or Buyer Parent (in
the case of information relating to matters for which Seller may
have indemnification obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents, or in the case of Privileged Information not solely related to the
Transferred Business and in which Seller may have an interest), as applicable
shall as promptly as practicable provide to the other party (following the
notice provisions set forth herein) a copy of such notice, the intended
response, and all materials or information that might be disclosed and the
proposed date of disclosure. In the event of a disagreement as to the
intended response or disclosure, unless and until the disagreement is resolved
as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, the disclosing party shall, at
the other partys expense, cooperate to the extent such other party seeks to
limit such disclosure and take all reasonable steps to resist or avoid such
disclosure, except as otherwise required by a court order requiring such
disclosure.

 

9.3 _Seller Non-Solicitation_

 

(a) Seller Parent agrees that, except as provided in _Section 9.3(b)_ and
_9.3(d)_ , it shall not, and it and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry with respect
to, or the making or submission of, any Company Proposal. Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection
therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

(b) If Seller Parent receives a bona fide written Company Proposal or inquiry
or proposal from a third party who is intending to make a Company Proposal and
such Company Proposal, inquiry or proposal was made after the date of this
Agreement and did not result from a breach of this  _Section 9.3_, Seller
Parent may take any or all of the following actions: (x) furnish non-public
information to the third party (and any Persons working in concert with such
third party and to their respective potential financing sources and
Representatives) making or intending to make such Company Proposal (provided
that all such information which relates to the Business has previously been
provided to Buyer Parent or is provided to Buyer Parent substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such third party), if, and only
if, prior to so furnishing such information, Seller Parent receives from the
third party an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less restrictive
of such third party than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such Company
Proposal. The limitations and obligations set forth in the first sentence of
_Section 9.3(a)_ and in this  _Section 9.3(b)_ and _Section 9.3(c)_ shall
be of no further force or effect following the Financing Contingency Release
Date.

 



98 (c) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours, following the receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective representatives of a Company Proposal, Seller Parent shall
provide Buyer Parent written notice thereof.

 

(d) Prior to the Financing Contingency Release Date, Seller Parent shall be
permitted to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Proposal (a "Company Transaction Agreement") so long as Seller Parent provided
written notice of such Company Proposal to Buyer Parent at least two Business
Days prior to entering into such definitive agreement and is not in breach of
this _Section 9.3_.

(e) As used in this Agreement, "Company Proposal" means any bona fide
proposal or bona fide offer made by any Person for (i) the acquisition of
Seller Parent by scheme of arrangement, takeover offer or business combination

20% of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in
such transaction immediately after consummation thereof; (ii) the acquisition
by any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) of 80% or more of the
outstanding Seller Parent Shares; or (iii) any merger, business combination,
consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving Seller Parent as a result of which the holders of Seller Parent
Shares immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at
least 20% of the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity
in such transaction immediately after consummation thereof.

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Financing Contingency Release Date" means the
date that Buyer Parent either (i) delivers the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii)
irrevocably waives the condition to its obligation to close in _Section
10.3(e)_.

 

(g) Seller Parent agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 9.3_ by any Representative of Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach by the Seller Parent of this _Section
9.3_.

9.4 _Seller Parent s Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Seller Parent agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide such assistance (and to use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide such assistance)
with respect to the Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing, any Replacement
Financing or any equity or equity-linked offerings or placements
(collectively, the "Financing") as is reasonably requested by Buyer Parent,
including using reasonable best efforts with respect to: (i) upon request
participating in, and assisting with, the due diligence and marketing efforts
related to the Financing, including participating in a reasonable number of

Parent and its Financing Sources with (A)(I) the Financial Statements required
pursuant to _Section 9.14_; and (II) any additional audited and unaudited

required by Rule 3-05(b)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act as
would be applicable to a registration statement filed with the SEC on Form
S-1 by Buyer Parent (assuming the consummation of the Transactions); and (B)
as promptly as practical after requested by Buyer Parent, all financial
statements, financial data, audit reports and other information with respect
to the Business of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K

with the Financing consistent with their customary practice, including by
participating in a reasonable number of drafting sessions, providing customary
"comfort letters" (including customary "negative assurances") and customary
assistance with the due diligence activities of Buyer Parent and the
Financing Sources (including by participating in a reasonable number of
accounting due diligence sessions), and customary consents to the inclusion of
audit reports in any relevant marketing materials, prospectuses, offering
memoranda, registration statements and related government filings; (v)
assisting Buyer Parent and the Financing Sources in the preparation of (A)
offering documents, prospectuses, registration statements,

sources for the syndication of credit facilities similar to those described in
the Debt Commitment Letter or for purposes of obtaining corporate and debt
ratings;  _provided_ that the effectiveness of any definitive documentation
executed by the Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to
the consummation of the Transactions. The Seller Parent hereby consents to the
use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Seller Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Seller Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or
in any other agreement between the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent (or its
affiliates), the Seller Parent agrees that Buyer Parent and its affiliates
may share

 



100  customary projections with respect to the Business with the Financing
Sources identified in the Debt Commitment Letter and to any existing lenders
of the Buyer Parent, and that Buyer Parent, its affiliates and such Financing
Sources may share such information with potential Financing Sources in
connection with any marketing efforts in connection with the Financing,
_provided_ that the recipients of such information are subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements between Buyer Parent and such parties (which need
not include Seller Parent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Seller Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
or their respective directors or officers or other personnel shall be
required by this _Section 9.4_ (1) to take any action or provide any
assistance that unreasonably interferes with the ongoing operations of the
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries; (2) to pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing or the Debt Financing

or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement
that is effective prior to the Closing (other than customary authorization and
representation letters and a payoff letter with respect to any credit
agreement). Buyer Parent shall (1) promptly upon request by the Seller
Parent, reimburse the Seller Parent for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by
the Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing
the assistance contemplated by this _Section 9.4_ other than accounting
costs and expenses incurred in connection with preparing any financial
statements or financial information required pursuant to _Section 9.14_ or
included in the Required Information and assisting Buyer Parent with the
preparation of pro forma financial statements and (2) indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers, personnel and advisors from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in
connection with the Financing or any assistance or activities in connection
therewith (other than arising from, fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
misstatements or omissions on the part of the Seller Parent or any of its
affiliates or Representatives).

 

(b) Seller Parent agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide such assistance (and to use reasonable best efforts
to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide such assistance)
with respect to obtaining the Debt Commitment Letter as is reasonably
requested by Buyer Parent, including cooperating in a timely manner with the
Financing Sources diligence and otherwise taking in a timely manner such of
the actions set out in _Section 9.4(a)_ as are relevant to Buyer Parent
obtaining the Debt Commitment Letter within the time period and in the amount
contemplated in  _Section 11.1(e)_.

9.5 _Buyer Parent s Financing Obligation._

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that, except as provided in _Section 10.3(e)_
there is no contingency on Buyer Parents obligations under this Agreement
related to Buyer Parents ability to secure financing. Promptly after entering
into the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer Parent shall deliver to Seller Parent a
true and complete copy of the executed Debt Commitment Letter and any related
fee letters (redacted as to economic terms and other commercially sensitive
numbers and provisions specified in any such fee letter (including any
provisions

 



101  relating to "flex" terms or similar concepts) excluding in each case, any
such provisions that could adversely affect the amount of the financing or the
Debt Financing Conditions). On and after the date of the Debt Commitment
Letter, Buyer Parent shall take, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be taken, all actions and do, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be done, all things necessary to obtain (x) the Debt Commitment Letter by
August 10, 2015 on terms that would satisfy the condition set forth in section
10.3(e) and (y) the Debt Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, including: (a)
maintaining in effect and enforcing the Debt Commitment Letter and complying
with its obligations thereunder; _provided_ , that the Debt Commitment Letter
may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as permitted pursuant to
this _Section 9.5_; (b) participation by senior management of Buyer Parent
in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations and
meetings with rating agencies; (c) satisfying on a timely basis all
conditions to the Debt Financing (including the Debt Financing Conditions) set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that are reasonably within Buyer Parents
control; (d) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto); and (e) subject to _Section 3.1_,
drawing the full amount of the Financing, in the event that the conditions
set forth in _Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.3_, and the Financing
Conditions, have been satisfied. Without limiting Buyer Parents other
obligations under this _Section 9.5_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs
Buyer Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Seller Parent of such Financing
Failure Event of which Buyer Parent becomes aware and the reasons therefor,
(ii) in consultation with the Seller Parent, use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain alternative financing from alternative Financing Sources on terms
(including relating to certainty of funding) not materially less favorable to
Buyer Parent, with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Buyer Parent, in an
amount sufficient, when added to the available cash of Buyer Parent and any
portion of the Financing that is available, to consummate the Transactions, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (such
financing, an "Alternative Financing"), and (iii) obtain, and when obtained,
provide the Seller Parent with a copy of, a new financing commitment that
provides for such Alternative Financing. Buyer Parent shall not, without the
Seller Parents prior written consent, agree to any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter
or any Debt Financing Document unless the terms and conditions thereof, as so
amended, modified or waived, are in the aggregate at least as favorable to
the Seller Parent and Buyer Parent as those contained therein prior to giving
effect to such amendment, modification or waiver; _provided_ , that Buyer
Parent may, without the Seller Parents prior written consent, (x) enter into
any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document
that would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the timely consummation of the Debt Financing or the
Transactions, (y) replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter and (z) implement or
exercise the "flex" provisions contained in one or more fee letters related to
the Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties hereto agree
that the following would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the timely consummation of the Debt Financing or the
Transactions: (i) any amendment, modification or waiver of the conditions
to obtaining the Debt Financing, unless such amendment, modification or
waiver results in conditions that are in the aggregate substantially

 



102  equivalent (or that are more favorable to the Seller Parent and Buyer
Parent), (ii) any amendment, modification or waiver that reduces the amount of
the Debt Financing or (iii) any amendment, modification or waiver that
materially adversely affects the ability of Buyer Parent or its affiliates to
enforce their rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter.
Buyer Parent shall keep the Seller Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Buyer Parent shall
have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity or equity-
linked offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt (including
unsecured notes) for all or any portion of the Debt Financing by reducing
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document;
_provided_ , that to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or
mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the
earliest of the consummation of the Transactions on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement or the Outside Date as applicable (for the
avoidance of doubt as it may be extended pursuant to this Agreement). Further,
Buyer Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of
other debt financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the
same and/or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
debt financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to funding of
such debt financing are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding,
substantially equivalent to (or no less favorable in any material respect to
the Seller Parent than) the Debt Financing Conditions (any such debt financing
which satisfies the foregoing, the "Replacement Financing"; the definitive
documentation for any such Replacement Financing, the "Replacement Financing
Documents"). The representations, warranties, covenants and other restrictions
of Buyer Parent and its affiliates contained in this Agreement with respect to
the Debt Financing and the Debt Commitment Letter shall apply equally to any
Replacement Financing and Replacement Financing Documents.

9.6 _Buyer Conduct; Non-Use_.

(a) Buyer Parent agrees that it shall not in any manner or in any location
including through entities that Buyer Parent directly or indirectly controls,
for the period beginning on the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, use the Information (as defined in _Section 13.3(c)_) to
develop, market or commercialize any product that has the same active
ingredient and is competitive with any Retained Product. Buyer Parent
acknowledges that such Information provides fundamentally competitive
information. Seller Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of this
provision pursuant to _Section 13.11_ hereof.

(b) Seller Parent agrees that it shall not in any manner or in any location
including through entities that Seller Parent directly or indirectly
controls, for the period beginning on the Closing Date hereof until the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, use the Information (as defined in _Section
13.3(c)_) to develop, market or commercialize any product that has the same
active ingredient and is competitive with any Product. Seller Parent
acknowledges that such Information provides fundamentally competitive
information. Buyer Parent shall be entitled to specific performance of this
provision pursuant to _Section 13.11_ hereof.

 



103 9.7 _Wrong Pocket Assets._

 

(a) If any Acquired Assets remains vested in any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates following Closing, such Seller shall (or shall cause
its applicable Affiliate to) transfer such Acquired Asset as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Buyer Parent or its designee for no
consideration (it being acknowledged and agreed that the Buyer shall have
already paid good consideration for all Acquired Assets by paying the Global
Purchase Price). The Seller shall notify the Buyer as soon as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware that that there are any Acquired Assets in its
possession or control or that of any Affiliate of any Seller.

(b) If any Excluded Asset is vested in the Buyer Parent or any of its
Affiliates following Closing, Buyer Parent shall (or shall cause its
applicable Affiliate to) transfer such Excluded Asset as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Seller Parent or its designee for no consideration (it
being acknowledged and agreed that the parties have not agreed to sell
such Excluded Asset). Buyer Parent shall notify the Seller Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable upon becoming aware that that there are any Excluded
Assets in its possession or control or that of any member of the Buyer Group.

 

9.8 _Release of Indemnity Obligations._

 

(a) Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall cooperate with each other with a view
to entering into arrangements effective as of the Closing whereby Buyer
Parent or its Affiliates would be substituted for Seller Parent or any
Retained Entity in any guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or
arrangements entered into by Seller Parent or the Retained Entities in respect
of the Business (but only to the extent such guarantees, letters of comfort,
indemnities or similar arrangements constitute Assumed Liabilities). If Buyer
Parent or its Affiliates cannot enter into the arrangements referred to above,
Seller Parent shall not terminate any such guarantee, letter of comfort,
indemnity or arrangement without Buyer Parents prior written consent;
provided, however, that Buyer Parent shall enter into a separate guaranty with
Seller Parent or the applicable Retained Entity to guarantee the performance
of the obligations of Seller Parent or such Retained Entity, as applicable,
under the Contract underlying such guarantee, letter of comfort, indemnity or
arrangement to the extent such obligations constitute Assumed Liabilities or
terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer Parent.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, cause all guarantees for money borrowed (under an indenture or
otherwise) to be terminated with respect to any member of the Transferred
Group. Prior to the Closing Buyer Parent shall and shall cause its Affiliates
to use reasonable efforts to cause all other guarantees, letters of comfort,
indemnities or arrangements entered into by the Transferred Group on behalf of
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Group and
other than to the extent included in Assumed Liabilities), to be
unconditionally released or extinguished, together with any ancillary
obligations thereto, without further recourse to the Transferred Group or
Buyer Parent and its Affiliates.

 

(c) After the Closing, each of Seller Parent and Buyer Parent, at the request
of the other, shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use,

under this Article XII has been given pursuant to _Section 12.4_ or _Section
12.5_, as the case may be, within the applicable survival period, the
representations and warranties that are the subject of such indemnification
claim (and the right to pursue such claim) shall survive with respect to such
claim until such time as such claim is finally resolved. It is the intention
of the Parties that the survival periods and termination date set forth in
this _Section 12.1_ supersede a statute of limitation applicable to such
representations and warranties or claim with respect thereof. The right of a
Person to any remedy pursuant to this _Article XII_ shall not be affected by
any investigation or examination conducted, or any knowledge possessed or
acquired (or capable of being possessed or acquired), by such Person at any
time concerning any circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the
accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation.

(b) In determining whether any representation or warranty in this Agreement
was true and correct as of any particular date and the amount of any Losses
in respect of the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true
and correct as of any particular date, any qualification or limitation as to
materiality (whether by reference to material adverse effect or otherwise)
contained in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded; provided
that this _Section 12.1(b)_ shall not apply to the representations and
warranties in _Sections 4.3_ [Financial Information], _4.9_ [Absence
of Certain Changes or Events], _4.10(a)_ [Business Contracts] _4.20_
[Acquired Assets] and _4.22_ [No Undisclosed Liabilities].

 

12.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the provisions of this _Section
12.2_, Seller Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyers, their
Affiliates

 



114  and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
permitted assigns, (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from,
against and in respect of any and all Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred
or suffered by, or asserted against, any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
whether in respect of third party claims, claims between the Parties, or
otherwise, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of, resulting
from, based upon, with respect to or by reason of:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Sellers in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any Excluded Liability; and

(iv) any Indebtedness of the Business or the Transferred Group at Closing to
the extent not taken into account in Closing Net Cash.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement other
than  _Section 12.2(a)_:

(i) the indemnification provided in _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to Buyer Indemnified Parties, for
any Losses arising out of or in connection with any breach or alleged breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement;

 

(ii) Sellers shall have no liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ unless (A) the Losses for which the Sellers
would be responsible for such claim and all related claims exceed the De
Minimis Amount and (B) the aggregate amount of Losses (excluding all Losses
associated with claims less than the De Minimis Amount) exceeds the
Deductible; provided further, that, each claim with respect to Taxes arising
out of a particular subject matter, set of facts, events or circumstances in a
taxing jurisdiction in any Tax period shall be treated as a separate claim
with respect to such Taxes for purposes of this _Section 12.2_;

(iii) subject to  _Section 12.2(c)_, the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in
_Section 12.2(a)(i)_ that may be recovered from Sellers shall not exceed
$500,000,000 (the "Cap"); and

(iv) the limitations in _Section 12.2(b)(ii_) and ( _iii)_ shall not
apply to any Losses as a result of inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 4.6(a)_ [Transferred Entities] and any such
Losses shall not be counted in determining the thresholds or the Cap.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations in _Section 12.2(b)(iii_), if the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising as a result of inaccuracies
in _Section 4.20(a)_ and _(b)_ [Acquired Assets] (excluding all Losses
associated with claims less than the De Minimis

 



115  Amount and excluding all Losses to the extent less than the Deductible and
including any Damages only in excess thereof) exceeds $1,000,000,000 in excess
of the Cap, (the "Acquired Assets Threshold"), Sellers shall then be liable
for any such Losses in excess of the Acquired Assets Threshold, up to an
aggregate maximum amount of $1,000,000,000 (exclusive of any amounts paid up
to the Cap).

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts taken into account in Closing Net
Cash or Closing Date Net Working Capital shall not be taken into account
under this _Section 12.2_.

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the provisions of this _Section
12.3_, Buyer Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers, their
respective Affiliates and their and their Affiliates respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties", and each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and the Seller Indemnified Parties, an "Indemnified Party") from, against and
in respect of any and all Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered
by, or asserted against, any of the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in
respect of third party claims, claims between the Parties, or otherwise,
directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of, resulting from, based
upon, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyers in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by Buyers pursuant to this Agreement;

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by Buyers in this Agreement
or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(iii) any Assumed Liability; and

 

(iv) all Liabilities and Claims relating to the operation of the Acquired
Assets (including those assets of the Transferred Entities that would be

extent such Liabilities or Claims are not Excluded Liabilities.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement other
than _Section 12.3(a)_:

 

(i) the indemnification provided in _Section 12.3(a)(i)_ shall be the sole
and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to the Seller Indemnified
Parties, as against Buyer for any Losses arising out of or in connection with
any breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement;

 

(ii) Buyers shall have no liability for any claim for indemnification pursuant

separate claim with respect to such Taxes for purposes of this _Section
12.23_;

(iii) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses arising out of or
resulting from the causes enumerated in _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ that may be
recovered from Buyers shall not exceed the Cap; and

 

(iv) the limitations in _Section 12.3(b)(ii)_ and _(iii)_ shall not apply to
any Losses as a result of inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of Buyer Parent in _Section 5.2(e)_ [Share Capital], and any such Losses
shall not be counted in determining the thresholds or the Cap.

 

12.4 _Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 8.2_ with respect to Tax Contest Claims,
in the event that any claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an
"Indemnifying Party") may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is
asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly,
but in no event more than ten days following such Indemnified Partys receipt
of a Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third
Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder
to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of
the final amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought
thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent
practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim Notice");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall
affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that
such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have 90 days (or such lesser number of days set
forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event
of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period")
to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at its expense. Once the Indemnifying
Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in
any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its own
cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights
of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse

 



117  effect to no more than a de minimis extent on other claims made or
threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) except
to the extent within the De Minimis Amount, any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party or (v) any non-monetary condition or obligation being
imposed on any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates that would restrict
the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense,  _it_
_being_ _understood_ that any right of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
have no liability with respect to a Third Party Claim settled without its
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim, including
by providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents and employees, _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the costs and expenses
of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be considered Losses. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other fully
informed with respect to the status of such Third Party Claim.

 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 

(f) Each of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent hereby consents to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Third Party Claim is brought
for purposes of any claim for indemnification or reimbursement with respect to
such Third Party Claim or the matters alleged therein.

 

12.5 _Direct Claims_. Except as provided in _Section 8.2_ with respect to Tax
Contest Claims, if an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for
indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of
damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate
shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim), any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto
and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days within which to
respond to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part
of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek enforcement
of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such
Direct Claim.

 



118 12.6 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person, in each case relating to the Third Party Claim or
the Direct Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred
in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds (including any
increased premiums resulting therefrom), shall be deducted, except to the
extent that the adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage
of all or part of such Loss. 

(b) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an
amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized (including the
utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward) as a result of such
Loss by the Party claiming such Loss, and there shall be added an amount equal
to any Tax imposed on the receipt of any indemnity payment with respect
thereto. A Party will be deemed to realize a net Tax benefit in a taxable
period in respect of any Loss incurred by such Party to the extent that the
cumulative liability for Taxes of such Party for such taxable period through
the end of the taxable period, calculated with such Loss excluded, exceeds
the actual cumulative liability for Taxes of such Party for such taxable
period through the end of such taxable period, calculated with such Loss
included.

 

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Article XII_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof, _less_ (ii) the full amount of the Loss.

 

(d) _Other Recovery_. The provisions of this _Article XII_ are not intended to
permit duplicate recoveries on the same matters, to the extent that any
payment is made under _Section 3.3_ or _Article VIII_ , no recovery in
respect of the same Claim will be available under this _Article XII_.

 

12.7 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant
to this _Article XII_ , in immediately available funds, to an account
specified by the Indemnified Party following receipt from an Indemnified Party
of a bill, together with all accompanying reasonably detailed supporting
documentation, for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss, in
which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. In any event, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party the amount of any Loss
for which it is liable hereunder, in immediately available funds, to an
account specified by the Indemnified Party no later than three days following
any Final Determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability
therefor.

 

12.8 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section 12.2_ or
_Section 12.3_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Global Purchase Price
for all applicable Tax purposes.

 



119 ARTICLE XIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

13.1  _Assignment_. Subject to _Section 1.4_, this Agreement may not be
assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party without the consent of the
other Party. Any purported assignment in violation of the preceding sentence
shall be void;  _provided, however_ , that Buyer Parent may, without
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller Parent, (i) assign its rights or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement or any Local Transfer
Agreement to any Affiliate or Subsidiary of Buyer Parent, or (ii)
collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to its secured lenders or
to any administrative agent acting on behalf of its secured lenders;
_provided_ that Buyer Parent shall, in each case, remain obligated for
performance of such obligations. Prior to the Closing, except in the case of
Seller Parent contemporaneously terminating this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 11.1(g)_, the ultimate parent entity of any acquirer of
Buyer Parent or Seller Parent shall expressly agree to be bound by and
perform the pre-Closing obligation of Buyer Parent or Seller Parent, as the
case may be, under this Agreement.

 

13.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither Party nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue any press release or make any public announcement

with respect to Buyer Parent and its Affiliates, and at all times, with
respect to Seller Parent and its Affiliates) without the prior written consent
of the other Party, which Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party and any of their
respective Affiliates may make any public disclosure (i) it believes in good

disclosure) or (ii) that is substantially consistent with a prior press

13.3 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer Parent and Seller Parent agree the Confidentiality Agreement, as it
relates to Information (as defined below) shall, as of the Closing Date, be
terminated and of no further force and effect.

(b) Subject to _Section 13.2_, Seller Parent agrees that, after the Closing,
Sellers and its Representatives shall keep confidential and exercise the same
degree of care with respect to maintaining the confidentiality of any
Information (as defined below) in any of their possession that Sellers
exercise with respect to similar types of their own proprietary information,
but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, except that if any
Information is required by Law or legal or administrative process to be
disclosed, Seller Parent shall promptly (and in any event prior to making
such disclosure, to the extent permitted by Law) notify Buyer Parent of such
disclosure requirement so that Buyer Parent or its Affiliates may seek a
protective Order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that no such
protective Order or other remedy is obtained, or Buyer Parent does not waive
compliance with this _Section 13.3(b)_, and the

 



120  applicable Seller or Representative is nonetheless legally compelled to
disclose such information, such Seller or its Representatives, as the case may
be, will furnish only that portion of the information which such Seller or
Representatives are, advised by counsel is legally required to be furnished

as far in advance as practicable and exercise all reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
information. For purposes of this _Section 13.3(b)_, the term "Information"
means (i) all information, knowledge and data of Seller and its Affiliates as
of immediately prior to the Closing to the extent related to the Business, the
Acquired Assets, the Products and/or the Assumed Liabilities and (ii) all
information, knowledge and data provided by Buyer Parent or any of its
Affiliates to any Seller in connection with the Transactions other than any
information contemplated by clause (i), other than any such information that

receipt thereof from Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates, (B) is disclosed
to a Seller by a third Person which has, or is reasonably believed by such
Seller to have, a legal right to make such disclosure without requiring such
Seller to maintain the confidentiality thereof, (C) is or becomes part of the
public domain through no fault of any Seller, or (D) is independently
developed by or for any Seller as evidenced by its written records, without
reliance or reference to any information contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii).

(c) Subject to _Section 13.2_, Buyer Parent agrees that, after the Closing,
Buyer Parent and its Representatives shall keep confidential and exercise the
same degree of care with respect to maintaining the confidentiality of any
Information (as defined below) in any of their possession that Buyer Parent
exercises with respect to similar types of its own proprietary information,
but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, except that if any
Information is required by Law or legal or administrative process to be
disclosed, Buyer Parent shall promptly (and in any event prior to making such
disclosure, to the extent permitted by Law) notify Seller Parent of such
disclosure requirement so that Sellers or their Affiliates may seek a
protective Order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that no such
protective Order or other remedy is obtained, or Seller Parent does not waive
compliance with this _Section 13.3(c)_, and Buyer Parent or its
Representative is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such information,
Buyer Parent or its Representatives, as the case may be, will furnish only
that portion of the information which Buyer Parent or its Representatives are,
advised by counsel is legally required to be furnished and will give Seller
Parent written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance as
practicable and exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the information. For purposes of
this _Section 13.3(c)_, the term "Information" means all information,
knowledge and data provided in connection with the Transactions by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates to Buyer Parent to the extent related to the Excluded
Assets and Excluded Liabilities, other than any such information that (A) is
known to any Buyer prior to receipt thereof from Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates, (B) is disclosed to a Buyer by a third Person which has, or is
reasonably believed by such Buyer to have, a legal right to make such
disclosure without requiring such Buyer to maintain the confidentiality
thereof, (C) is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault of
Buyer, or (D) is independently developed by or for any Buyer as evidenced by
its written records, without reliance or reference to Information received
from Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates.

13.4  _Expenses_. Whether or not the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, and except as otherwise specified herein, each
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



121 13.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. Further, the Parties agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

13.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (including the Local Transfer Agreements and Transfer Documents
after their execution and delivery hereunder) contain the entire agreement of
the Parties with respect to the Transactions, superseding all negotiations,
prior discussions and preliminary agreements made prior to the date hereof.
This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except
by an instrument in writing signed by both Seller Parent and Buyer Parent. No
such supplement, amendment or addition shall be evidence, in and of itself
that the representations and warranties in the corresponding section are no
longer true and correct in all material respects. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, this sentence of _Section 13.6_, _Section 13.7_ and
_Section 13.10_, shall not be amended or otherwise modified without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources to the extent such amendment or
modification would have an adverse effect on the Financing Sources rights
thereunder.

13.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the Parties and, to the extent set forth herein, their respective Affiliate
and the Indemnified Parties, and no provision of this Agreement shall be
deemed to otherwise confer upon any other third parties any remedy,
Claim, Liability, reimbursement, Claim of action or other right in excess of
those existing without reference to this Agreement; provided that the
Financing Sources are intended beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to
enforce,  _Section 11.2(c)_, _Section 13.6_, this _Section 13.7_, _Section
13.10(b)_, _Section 13.10(c)_ and _Section 13.10(d)_.

 

13.8 _Waiver_. The waiver by a Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement or of any right or privilege
conferred by this Agreement shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges or as a waiver of
any other terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges. No waiver shall
be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
Representative of the waiving Party.

13.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any Claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

Sources_. 

(a) Each Party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for

shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party hereto
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in  _Section 13.16_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND

WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party hereto agrees
that (i) it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the

for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and (ii)
any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of
any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates and Representatives

contemplated hereby or thereby and no Financing Source shall have any rights
or claims against any Seller or its Affiliates in connection with this
