Approximately 12.9x 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and 8.9x 2015 Adjusted EBITDA with
Synergies

Strengthens Mylans Position as a Diversified Global Pharmaceutical Leader
with an Expansive and Growing Portfolio of Specialty, Generic and OTC
Products and a Strong, Complementary Therapeutic Presence

Combined Business Will Have Critical Mass across Commercial Channels in
Europe, a Leading U.S. Specialty Business, and an Exciting Platform for Growth

Expected to Be Immediately Accretive to Mylan Earnings, with Accretion
Increasing Significantly after First Full Year (2017) as Synergies Are
Realized; Creates Opportunity to Achieve $0.35-$0.40 Accretion in 2017 and to
Accelerate Achievement of Previously Stated $6.00 Adjusted Diluted EPS Target
in 2017 Versus 2018

Anticipated Annual Operational Synergies of Approximately $350 million

 

Medas Board of Directors Recommends that Meda Shareholders Accept Mylans
Public Cash-and-Stock Offer, as it Delivers Immediate and Significant Value
to Meda Shareholders; Medas Two Largest Shareholders, Representing
Approximately 30 Percent of Medas Outstanding Shares, Have Undertaken to
Accept the Offer

 

Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ, TASE: MYL), a leading global pharmaceutical company
("Mylan"), today announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of
Meda Aktiebolag (publ.) ("Meda") to tender all their shares in Meda to Mylan
(the "Offer"). The total Offer consideration consists of a combination of cash
and Mylan ordinary shares ("Mylan Shares") with a value at announcement of
SEK 165 per Meda share. The total value of the Offer for all Meda shares,
including Meda net debt, is approximately SEK 83.6 billion or USD 9.9 billion,
which represents a multiple of approximately 8.9x 2015 adjusted EBITDA with
synergies.

The combination of Mylan and Meda will create a diversified global
pharmaceutical leader with an expansive portfolio of branded and generic
medicines and a strong and growing portfolio of over-the-counter (OTC)
products. The combined company will have a balanced global footprint with
significant scale in key geographic markets, particularly the U.S. and Europe.
The acquisition of Meda also provides Mylan with entry into a number of new
and attractive emerging markets, including China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the
Middle East and Mexico, complemented by Mylans presence in India, Brazil and
Africa. Mylan and Meda have a highly complementary therapeutic presence,
which will create a leading global player in respiratory / allergy, and
achieve critical mass in dermatology and pain, offering greater opportunities
for growth in these categories. The Offer has been unanimously approved by Mylans board of directors and
unanimously recommended by Medas board of directors. Medas two largest
shareholders, representing in the aggregate approximately 30 percent of Medas
outstanding shares, have undertaken to accept the Offer, subject to certain
conditions. Medas shares are listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, Large Cap. The
Offer is subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions,
including clearance from relevant competition authorities, and is expected to
be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016. The Offer is not
subject to approval by Mylan shareholders and is not subject to any financing
conditions.

 

Comments from Mylan

Mylan Executive Chairman, Robert Coury, commented, "Our acquisition of Meda
will allow us to accelerate and deliver on the clear and compelling vision and
strategy we have continuously communicated to our shareholders, and once again
deliver a transaction that will create significant value. We believe Mylan is
uniquely positioned in the global pharmaceutical space today, with very strong
fundamentals and a long and successful track record of executing on all
previous acquisitions and organic opportunities. We structured this
transaction in a way that optimizes our balance sheet and still leaves us
ample financial flexibility to continue to complement our business with
additional attractive opportunities.

 

"Meda is a unique and strategic asset, with a high quality workforce, which
will add to our powerful, diversified and sustainable global platform
and provide exciting new opportunities for Mylan, its shareholders and all of
our other stakeholders. I look forward to welcoming Medas talented workforce
to Mylan upon closing, and also to welcoming our newest shareholders,
including Stena and Fidim. On behalf of Mylans entire board of directors, we
look forward to them becoming long-term shareholders in the success of our
combined company."

 

Mylan CEO, Heather Bresch, commented, "This transaction builds on everything
we have put in place around the world, including our recent acquisition
of the Abbott non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics
business. Meda brings us greater scale, breadth and diversity across products,
geographies and sales channels, and together we will have an even stronger
global commercial infrastructure. We have been very clear about our
commitment to enter the OTC space and continue our expansion in emerging
markets and, with this transaction, we will have an approximately $1 billion
OTC business at close and gain entry into new growth markets such as China,
Southeast Asia, Russia and the Middle East. Meda and Mylan also have an
extremely complementary therapeutic presence and we see exciting opportunities
across a number of strategically important categories,
particularly allergy/respiratory, given the strength of our combined
portfolio, the multitude of exciting launches we will have in the coming
years, and the commercial strength of our combined business. Importantly, this
transaction is extremely financially compelling, providing significant
accretion to Mylans earnings per share, the opportunity for substantial
synergies and the further acceleration of our growth trajectory, with the
transaction providing the opportunity to achieve $0.35-$0.40 accretion in
2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6.00 adjusted
diluted EPS target to 2017, versus 2018.1

 

"Given our long relationship and existing successful EpiPen partnership in
Europe with Meda, we have come to know their business, people and
culture extremely well, and we are confident that we will be able to quickly
begin realizing the significant value we see from this combination and
continue to enhance our leadership position in todays highly competitive and
rapidly evolving industry."

Comments from Meda, Stena Sessan Rederi AB and Fidim S.r.l.

 

"On behalf of the Meda Board, I am pleased to announce that we recommend to
our shareholders to accept Mylans Offer. We believe that the Offer provides
excellent value for Meda shareholders and we share a common vision with Mylan
to create a leading pharma player. The transaction will provide critical mass
across all commercial channels in Europe, create a leading U.S. specialty
business and provide an exciting platform for growth in emerging markets,"
said Peter von Ehrenheim, member of the Board of Directors of Meda.

 



   1  | Stated 2017 opportunity/2018 target; this is a long-term target
only and does not represent company guidance. 
---|--- 
 



2 "Over the course of more than 10 years, I have been privileged to first be a
part of, and more recently to lead, Meda. I believe that Meda is an
exceptional organization that has continued to go from strength to strength
and has a strong and well-defined growth profile going forward. The proposed
transaction with Mylan is very compelling from a strategic standpoint and I
believe Meda will be a strong partner for Mylan and will bring additional
value to Mylan. The two businesses are highly complementary, and the combined
business will benefit from strong therapeutic presence in
respiratory/allergy, dermatology and pain and inflammation, as well as
enhancing our mass in Europe and US presence," said Chief Executive Officer of
Meda, Dr. Jorg-Thomas Dierks.

 

"Stena Sessan welcomes the Offer made by Mylan and believes the combined
entity will benefit all shareholders, given the combined scale in an
ever consolidating market. The combined entity will create a global leader
which is a diversified player across specialty, generics and OTC with a strong
growth profile. Stena looks forward to becoming a long-term shareholder of
Mylan," said Martin Svalstedt, Chairman of Meda and CEO of Stena Sessan AB.

"Fidim S.r.l. is delighted to receive the Offer from Mylan. Having been the
owner of Rottapharm and then the second largest shareholder in Meda, we see
this as the next step in continuing the market consolidation to extract the
best value for all Meda stakeholders and to create a global pharma player of
which we have the intention to remain a long-term shareholder," said Luca
Rovati from Fidim S.r.l.

Background and reasons for the Offer

 

Mylan believes the transaction has a compelling strategic fit. In an
environment where scale and reach are becoming increasingly important, a
combination of Mylan and Meda will create a platform for sustainable, long-
term growth:



     |  |  | The combined company will be a diversified global

durable growth for the long term. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Following completion of the acquisition of Meda, Mylan
will have an enhanced financial profile with approximately USD 11.8 billion in
combined 2015 sales and combined 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately USD
3.8 billion.

     |  |  | The combined business will have a balanced portfolio of
more than 2,000 products across the branded/specialty, generics and OTC
segments, sold in more than 165 markets around the world. 
---|---|---|--- 
 





   3  | See footnote 1. 
---|--- 
   4  | Since each of Stena and Fidim has entered into an undertaking to
tender its Meda shares in the Offer and a related shareholder agreement
(please see "Undertakings to accept the Offer and shareholder agreements"
below), Board members Martin Svalstedt, Luca Rovati, Peter Claesson and Lars
Westerberg have not participated in the Meda Board of Directors decision to
recommend the Offer. The other Meda Board members who did participate in such
decision unanimously recommend the Offer. 
---|--- 
 



4 acquisition of the Abbott non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded
generics business to create an unparalleled European platform for growth - one
that is well-positioned to succeed in this dynamic and challenging region.
The transaction also consolidates EpiPen® Auto-Injector in Europe, providing
greater opportunities to build the brand in this region. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | The transaction delivers on Mylans long-stated
commitment to develop a substantial presence in the OTC segment, by creating
an approximately USD 1 billion global OTC business at close. 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Mylans and Medas complementary therapeutic presence
will create a scale player in respiratory / allergy, dermatology and pain
products, providing greater opportunities for growth in these areas
and maximizing the potential of future product launches. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | By offering one of the industrys broadest portfolios of
products across all customer channels (e.g., specialty, generics and OTC), the
combined company will be well-positioned to deliver greater value
to customers, which is increasingly important in light of the evolving payor
and distributor environment. The combined portfolio will be supported by an
expansive global commercial infrastructure, with sales representatives
operating in 60 countries. The combined company will retain significant
control over its supply chain, operating one of the industrys most extensive
and highest-quality manufacturing and research and development platforms with
approximately 60 facilities.  
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Substantial pre-tax annual operational synergies of
approximately $350 million by year four after consummation of the Offer are
expected to be realized as a result of savings associated with integration and
optimization across cost components and functions, and through leveraging
opportunities of the combined commercial platform. Components of these
synergies include: (1) optimization of the combined commercial platform, (2)
optimization of COGS through world-class supply chain, vertical integration
and global sourcing excellence, (3) elimination of redundant general and
administrative costs, including public company costs, and (4) cross-
fertilization opportunities of the combined product portfolio. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive
to Mylan earnings, with accretion increasing significantly after the first
full year (2017) as synergies are realized. The transaction creates an
opportunity to achieve $0.35 to $0.40 accretion in 2017 and to accelerate
achievement of Mylans previously stated $6.00 in adjusted diluted EPS target
in 2017 versus 2018.5 
---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  | Mylans pro forma leverage at close is expected to be
approximately 3.8x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, and the significant free cash
flows generated by the combined company will allow for rapid deleveraging. As
a result, Mylan will retain ample financial flexibility to pursue additional
external opportunities. 
---|---|---|--- 

Mylan believes that the Offer is compelling given that:



     |  |  | the Offer consideration represents a meaningful premium
for Meda shareholders; 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | at announcement, the total value of the Offer for all
Meda shares, including Meda net debt, is approximately SEK 83.6 billion or USD
9.9 billion, which represents a multiple of approximately 8.9x 2015
adjusted EBITDA with synergies;6 
---|---|---|--- 



 



   5  | See footnote 1. 
---|--- 
   6  | The total Offer value (including Meda net debt) of approximately
SEK 83.6 billion or USD 9.9 billion is based on (1) a Mylan Share closing
price of USD 50.74 as of 9 February 2016, (2) a SEK/USD exchange rate of
8.4158 as of 9 February 2016, (3) 365,467,371 outstanding Meda shares as of 9
February 2016 and (4) net debt of Meda of SEK 23.3 billion as of 31 December
2015. 
---|--- 
 



5 become shareholders of Mylan, which has a clear track record of creating
shareholder value, with an annualized three year total shareholder return of
approximately 20.7 percent;7 and 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | the Offer is fully financed and not conditional on
further due diligence. 
---|---|---|--- 

In addition to the compelling value to shareholders, the acquisition of Meda
by Mylan would offer substantial benefits to the other stakeholders of both
companies. For example, the combination would provide a broader variety of
opportunities to employees. The position of creditors, customers and
suppliers would also be enhanced by the combined companys scale and
significant cash flows, and patients would receive improved access to high-
quality medicine through increased scale across geographies and robust
capabilities to drive innovation.

Management and employees

 

Mylan recognizes the exceptional capabilities and skills of Medas dedicated
management and employees and looks forward to welcoming these individuals
to Mylan. Further, Meda has infrastructure in a number of markets where Mylan
currently has limited resources, including Sweden. To realize the synergies
discussed above, the integration of Mylan and Meda will likely entail some
changes to the organization, operations and employees of the combined group.
In the period following the completion of the Offer and following careful
review of the needs of the combined business, Mylan will determine the optimal
structure of the combined company to continue to deliver success in the
future. Before completion of the Offer it is too early to say which measures
will be taken and the impact these would have. There are currently no
decisions on any material changes to Mylans or Medas employees and
management or to the existing organization and operations, including the terms
of employment and locations of the business.

 

The Offer

At announcement, the Offer consideration values each Meda share at SEK 165
and the total equity value of the Offer for all Meda shares is approximately
SEK 60.3 billion or USD 7.2 billion.8

USD 7.2 billion is based on (1) a Mylan Share closing price of USD 50.74 as of
9 February 2016, (2) a SEK/USD exchange rate of 8.4158 as of 9 February 2016
and (3) 365,467,371 outstanding Meda shares as of 9 February 2016.

6 than or equal to USD 30.78, a number of Mylan Shares per Meda share equal to
SEK 100 divided by the Offeror Average Closing Price as converted from USD to
SEK at a SEK/USD exchange rate of 8.4158. 
---|---|---|--- 

If the aggregate number of Mylan Shares that otherwise would be required to be
issued by Mylan as described above exceeds 28,214,081 Mylan Shares (the
"Share Cap"),9 then Mylan will have the option (in its sole discretion) to (a)
issue Mylan Shares in connection with the Offer in excess of the Share Cap
and thus pay the share portion of the Offer consideration as described above
(i.e. the 20 percent set out above), (b) increase the cash portion of the
Offer consideration (so that it becomes larger than the 80 percent set out
above) and thus correspondingly decrease the share portion of the Offer
consideration (so that it becomes smaller than the 20 percent set out above)
such that the aggregate number of Mylan Shares issuable by Mylan in connection
with the Offer would equal the Share Cap or (c) execute a combination of the
foregoing. The potential adjustment to the composition of the Offer
consideration, together with illustrative examples, will be described in
further detail in the offer document to be prepared for the Offer.

In short, each Meda shareholder will receive between SEK 152 and SEK 165 per
Meda share in a combination of cash and Mylan Shares.10

Only whole Mylan Shares will be delivered to Meda shareholders who accept the
Offer. Treatment of fractional shares will be described in the offer document
to be prepared for the Offer.

If Meda pays dividends or makes any other distributions to its shareholders
with a record date occurring prior to the settlement of the Offer, or issues
new shares (or takes any similar corporate action) resulting in a reduction of
the value per share in Meda prior to the settlement of the Offer, the Offer
consideration will be reduced accordingly. The reduction shall first be made
against the cash portion of the Offer consideration. Mylan reserves the right
to determine whether this price adjustment mechanism or condition (vii) to
the completion of the Offer shall be invoked. Notwithstanding the foregoing in
this paragraph, Meda will be permitted to pay in 2016 its regular annual cash
dividend in respect of Meda shares not exceeding SEK 2.5 per Meda share, with
declaration, record and payment dates consistent with past practice, and such
regular annual cash dividend shall not reduce the Offer consideration.

 

No commission will be charged in respect of the settlement of the Meda shares
tendered to Mylan in the Offer.

 

The Offer is not subject to any financing conditions. The cash portion of the
Offer consideration will be financed by a new bridge credit facility arranged
by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA.

At the time of this announcement Mylan does not hold any Meda shares or any
financial instruments that give financial exposure to Meda shares, nor has
Mylan acquired or agreed to acquire any Meda shares or any financial
instruments that give financial exposure to Meda shares during the six months
preceding the announcement of the Offer. For further information about the
undertakings by each of Stena and Fidim to accept the Offer, please see
"Undertakings to accept the Offer and shareholder agreements" below.

 

Share-based awards granted by Meda to employees under Medas incentive plans

employees. Mylan intends to procure fair treatment in connection with the
transaction for holders of such share-based awards.
