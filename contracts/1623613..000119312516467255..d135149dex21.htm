of Meda Aktiebolag (publ.) (&#147;Meda&#148;) to tender all their shares in Meda to Mylan (the &#147;Offer&#148;). The total Offer consideration consists of a combination of cash and Mylan ordinary shares (&#147;Mylan Shares&#148;) with a value at
announcement of SEK 165&nbsp;per Meda share. The total value of the Offer for all Meda shares, including Meda net debt, is approximately SEK 83.6 billion or USD&nbsp;9.9&nbsp;billion, which represents a multiple of approximately 8.9x 2015 adjusted
EBITDA with synergies. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The combination of Mylan and Meda will create a diversified global pharmaceutical leader with an expansive portfolio of
branded and generic medicines and a strong and growing portfolio of over-the-counter (OTC) products. The combined company will have a balanced global footprint with significant scale in key geographic markets, particularly the U.S. and Europe. The
acquisition of Meda also provides Mylan with entry into a number of new and attractive emerging markets, including China, Southeast Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Mexico, complemented by Mylan&#146;s presence in India, Brazil and Africa. Mylan
and Meda have a highly complementary therapeutic presence, which will create a leading global player in respiratory / allergy, and achieve critical mass in dermatology and pain, offering greater opportunities for growth in these categories. </B></P>

Chairman, Robert Coury, commented, &#147;Our acquisition of Meda will allow us to accelerate and deliver on the clear and compelling vision and strategy we have continuously communicated to our shareholders, and once again deliver a transaction that
will create significant value. We believe Mylan is uniquely positioned in the global pharmaceutical space today, with very strong fundamentals and a long and successful track record of executing on all previous acquisitions and organic
opportunities. We structured this transaction in a way that optimizes our balance sheet and still leaves us ample financial flexibility to continue to complement our business with additional attractive opportunities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Meda is a unique and strategic asset, with a high quality workforce, which will add to our powerful, diversified and sustainable global platform and
provide exciting new opportunities for Mylan, its shareholders and all of our other stakeholders. I look forward to welcoming Meda&#146;s talented workforce to Mylan upon closing, and also to welcoming our newest shareholders, including Stena and
Fidim. On behalf of Mylan&#146;s entire board of directors, we look forward to them becoming long-term shareholders in the success of our combined company.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mylan CEO, Heather Bresch, commented, &#147;This transaction builds on everything we have put in place around the world, including our recent acquisition of
the Abbott non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business. Meda brings us greater scale, breadth and diversity across products, geographies and sales channels, and together we will have an even stronger global commercial
infrastructure. We have been very clear about our commitment to enter the OTC space and continue our expansion in emerging markets and, with this transaction, we will have an approximately $1 billion OTC business at close and gain entry into new
growth markets such as China, Southeast Asia, Russia and the Middle East. Meda and Mylan also have an extremely complementary therapeutic presence and we see exciting opportunities across a number of strategically important categories, particularly
allergy/respiratory, given the strength of our combined portfolio, the multitude of exciting launches we will have in the coming years, and the commercial strength of our combined business. Importantly, this transaction is extremely financially
compelling, providing significant accretion to Mylan&#146;s earnings per share, the opportunity for substantial synergies and the further acceleration of our growth trajectory, with the transaction providing the opportunity to achieve $0.35-$0.40
accretion in 2017 and to accelerate achievement of our previously stated $6.00 adjusted diluted EPS target to 2017, versus 2018.<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Given our long relationship and existing successful EpiPen partnership in Europe with Meda, we have come to know their business, people and culture
extremely well, and we are confident that we will be able to quickly begin realizing the significant value we see from this combination and continue to enhance our leadership position in today&#146;s highly competitive and rapidly evolving
industry.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Comments from Meda, Stena Sessan Rederi AB and Fidim S.r.l. </B></P>

provides excellent value for Meda shareholders and we share a common vision with Mylan to create a leading pharma player. The transaction will provide critical mass across all commercial channels in Europe, create a leading U.S. specialty business
