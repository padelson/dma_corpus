material liability to the Bank Entities, Purchaser or Parent; and (C) in the
event of a partial or total withdrawal from each Multiemployer Plan (either

(a) _Organization, Standing and Authority_. Purchaser is a bank duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Puerto
Rico. Purchaser has all corporate (or similar) power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted
and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or
leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
on Purchasers ability to (A) satisfy its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) obtain reasonably
promptly the Requisite Regulatory Approvals listed on the Purchaser Requisite
Regulatory Approvals Schedule.

(b) _Corporate Authorization and Binding Effect_. Purchaser has the power and

obligation of Purchaser, and the other Transaction Documents to which
Purchaser is or as of the Closing will be a party have been, or at Closing
will be, duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and assuming due
authorization, execution, and delivery of the Transaction Documents by the
other parties thereto, constitute, or at Closing will constitute, valid and
binding agreements of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance
with their respective terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equitable principles).

(c) _Regulatory Filings; No Defaults_.

 

(1) No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any
Governmental Authority or other Person are required to be made or obtained by

satisfy its or their obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) obtain reasonably promptly the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals listed on the Purchaser Requisite Regulatory Approvals

Affiliates of the Transaction Documents, the performance by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates of their respective obligations thereunder and the
consummation by them of the transactions contemplated thereby do not
constitute a violation or breach of or default under or give rise to (or give
rise after the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or to a loss of any benefits to which Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates is entitled under any provision of (A) Purchasers or
its applicable Affiliates constituent documents and (B) assuming compliance
with the requirements referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)(1)_, any Law,
regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Purchaser,
other than violations which would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Purchasers or its
Affiliates ability to (i) satisfy its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) obtain reasonably promptly the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals listed on the Purchaser Requisite Regulatory
Approvals Schedule.

 

(3) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened

one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, including with
respect to capital requirements, that (A) would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay Purchaser from being able to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (B) would reasonably be expected to impair the validity or
materially delay the consummation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. As of the date hereof, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates has received any indication from any Governmental Authority that
such Governmental Authority would oppose or refuse to grant or issue its
consent or approval, if required, with respect to the transactions

(2) as to any matter the disclosure of which would violate the confidentiality
rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Puerto Rico
Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, the Puerto Rico Office
of the Commissioner of Insurance or any other applicable Governmental

7.01_, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including 
_Section_ __ _ 4.02(d)_ hereof), each of Seller, Purchaser and Parent agrees

date hereof, each Party shall be given the opportunity to review in advance,
and shall consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all non-
confidential, material written information submitted to any third Person
(other than such Partys Representatives) or any Governmental Authority in
connection with any Requisite Regulatory Approval and, subject to the
foregoing, each Party shall have the opportunity to participate in any
material calls and meetings with Governmental Authorities with regard to the

respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third Persons and Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and each Party shall keep the other Parties apprised
of the status of material matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Specifically, all filings made relating to
competitive issues shall be prepared jointly by the Parties.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Parent
agree, and shall cause their Affiliates, to take all actions necessary,
including, but not limited to, those relating to a Remedial Action or a
Capital Action to: (1) obtain all Requisite Regulatory Approvals listed in the
Purchaser Requisite Regulatory Approvals Schedule and (2) avoid or eliminate
any impediment to obtaining any Requisite Regulatory Approvals listed in the
Purchaser Requisite Regulatory Approvals Schedule, in each case of (1) and
(2), to cause the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to
occur as promptly as practicable and, in any event, prior to the Outside

means (x) promptly complying with any request for information by any
Governmental Authority; (y) offering, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by agreement, consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the

pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling,

of this _Section_ __ _ 4.02(c)_, " _Capital Action_ " means (x) committing to
any Governmental Authority with regulatory or supervisory authority over
Parent, Purchaser or their applicable Affiliates to maintain capital levels
and capital ratios at a level specified by such Governmental Authority, either
formally or informally, and either currently or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents; (y) creating
a capital plan that is acceptable to any Governmental Authority with
regulatory or supervisory authority over Parent, Purchaser or their applicable
Affiliates, either by entering into a new capital plan or modifying an
existing capital plan and (z) taking all actions reasonably necessary,
including by raising capital through a public or private equity or debt
offering, to satisfy fully and achieve the regulatory capital expectations of
any Governmental Authority with regulatory or supervisory authority over
Parent, Purchaser or their applicable Affiliates in the time frames required
by such Governmental Authority.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Sections_ __ _ 4.02(b)_ and _(c)_ or
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent or Purchaser to take any action, or commit to take
any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals that would reasonably be
expected to be materially burdensome to Parent, Purchaser and their
Affiliates,

 



-48- 

    

 taken as a whole, following the consummation of the Stock Sale and the Bank
Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreements (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ");  _provided_ that any Capital Action required to be
taken shall not constitute, or be considered in determining whether any
required action constitutes, a Burdensome Condition.

 

(e) Each Party shall, upon request, furnish the other Parties all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of it or any of its Affiliates with or to any third Person or
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents other than information containing competitively
sensitive business or other proprietary information or confidential
supervisory information or that is not permitted to be disclosed under
applicable Law.

(f) Any Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive business or other proprietary or confidential
information provided to the other Party under this _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ as
"outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein
shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient Party, and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the receiving Party unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials or its legal counsel. 

4.03 _Press Releases_. From and after the date of this Agreement and
continuing thereafter (including following the Closing), Seller and Parent
shall consult with each other before issuing (or permitting any Affiliate to
issue) any press release or public statement or making any other public
disclosure (including, prior to the Closing, any broad-based employee
communication that is reasonably likely to become the subject of public
disclosure) related to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby and shall not issue any such press release or public
statement or make any other such public disclosure without the prior written
consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ shall be deemed
to prohibit Seller or Parent from making any disclosure necessary in order to
satisfy its disclosure obligations imposed by Law or applicable public stock
exchange or any other similar self-regulatory organization. In addition to the
foregoing, Seller and Parent shall not issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other, the others
Affiliates or the business, financial condition or results of operations of
the other or the others Affiliates without the prior written consent of
Seller or Parent, as the case may be, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without limiting the foregoing, without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), each Party shall cause its
respective Affiliates not to issue any press release or public statement or
make any other public disclosure related to the Transaction Documents and the
transactions

 



-49- 

    

 contemplated thereby. This _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ shall not prohibit any
press release or public statement or disclosure so long as any statements
contained therein concerning the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated thereby are consistent with and limited in all material respects
to the statements contained in previous press releases or public statements or
disclosures made by the applicable Party with respect to such Party has
complied with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_.

4.04 _Access; Information_ _; Transfer of Books and Records_.

(a) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, during the period from the
date of this Agreement continuing through the Closing or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Bank Entities to, afford to Purchaser, its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours, to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities, and to the contracts, Books and
Records and other documents and data to the extent relating to the business
of the Bank Entities, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that
Purchaser, including through its Representatives, may from time to time
reasonably request and Seller shall, and shall cause the Bank Entities and
its and their respective Representatives to, furnish Purchaser and its
Representatives all relevant financial, operating and other data and
information to the extent primarily relating to the Bank Entities, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities in any of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates (including the Bank Entities) possession or control which
Purchaser, including through its Representatives, may from time to time
reasonably request, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchasers access to Tax
Returns and other Tax information filed by or otherwise relating to the Bank
Entities shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 4.12_; _provided_ , _further_
that Seller shall not be required to provide access to any information to the
extent that such access: (1) would violate applicable Law; (2) would result in
disclosure of (I) any confidential supervisory information, (II) any Trade
Secrets or (III) any competitively sensitive information of Seller or of a
third Person or Governmental Authority to whom Seller has confidentiality
obligations; or (3) would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Person in possession or control of such information (unless, in the case of
this clause (3), Purchaser agrees to enter into a joint defense agreement or
other similar agreement that would be reasonably expected to preserve such
privilege); _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (2)(III) and (3), Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to make substitute disclosure arrangements
that are reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, conduct its activities permitted under this _Section_
__ _ 4.04(a)_ in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Seller and its Affiliates. All requests for access
to the Books and Records shall be made to such Representatives of Seller as
Seller shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for coordinating all
such requests and all access permitted hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt,
to the extent a Party is otherwise entitled to "access" hereunder, "access"
is understood to include the ability of such Party to obtain or retain copies
of such information and to use such information for the purposes, and in
accordance with, the provisions specified in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.04_.

 



-50- 

    

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement continuing through the

(C), collectively, the " _Interim Financial Statements_ "), in each case, when
such Interim Financial Statements are available in the ordinary course of
business.

 

(c) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered, at the Closing, to the applicable Bank Entities copies of all of
the Books and Records (other than Excluded Books and Records) that are not in
(x) the possession or control of the Bank Entities or (y) the storage facility
described in Section 4.04(c) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules (the " _Storage
Facility_ "). To the extent any Books and Records (other than Excluded Books
and Records) are not in the possession or control of the Bank Entities and are
not in the Storage Facility, in each case, as of the Closing, Seller shall
deliver or cause to be delivered, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing (and in any event no later than the fifteenth day following the
Closing Date), to the applicable Bank Entity copies of all of such Books and
Records. With respect to the Books and Records located at the Storage
Facility, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith and use
reasonable best efforts to seek to have such Books and Records transferred
from Sellers agreements with the Storage Facility provider governing
Sellers documents maintained at the Storage Facility to Purchasers
agreements with the Storage Facility provider governing Purchasers documents
maintained at the Storage Facility (to the extent possible without any
physical movement or relocation of any such Books and Records). All costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such transfer contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence shall be borne and paid by Seller,  _provided_
, that to the extent any costs and expenses are incurred in respect of the
physical movement or relocation of Books and Records required by the Storage
Facility provider, such costs and expenses shall be borne and paid equally
by Seller and Purchaser.

(d) Purchaser shall maintain records of the Bank Entities in accordance with
its document retention policies applied generally to its operations. To the
extent the relevant information, data or records continues to be maintained by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (in the case of the following clause (i))
or by Seller or any of its Affiliates (in the case of the following clause
(ii)), (i) Purchaser will grant to Seller and its Representatives reasonable
access upon prior notice and during Purchasers normal business hours to all
Books and Records that are in the possession or control of the 

 



-51- 

    

 Bank Entities as of the Closing, other documents and data relating to the
business of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and to Continuing
Employees, and (ii) Seller will grant, and will cause its Affiliates to grant
to, Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access upon prior notice and
during Sellers normal business hours to all Excluded Books and Records that
are not transferred to the Bank Entities in accordance with _Section_ __ _
4.04(c)_ above; _provided_ that Seller and its Representative shall only be
entitled to such access under clause (i) to the extent such access is
reasonably necessary in connection with (1) Sellers or its Affiliates
preparation of its financial statements or Tax Returns, (2) regulatory or
compliance matters relating to Sellers prior ownership of the Bank Entities,
or (3) litigation relating to Sellers prior ownership of the Bank Entities
(other than any litigation between Seller or any of its post-Closing
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its post-Closing
Affiliates, on the other hand); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that neither
Purchaser, Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
provide access under clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, to any information to
the extent that such access: (x) would violate applicable Law; (y) would
result in disclosure of any (I) confidential supervisory information, (II)
Trade Secrets or (III) competitively sensitive information of Purchaser,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, or of a third
Person or Governmental Authority to whom, Purchaser, Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates has confidentiality obligations; or (z) would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the Person in possession or control of such
information (unless, in the case of this clause (z), Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, agrees to enter into a joint defense agreement or other similar
agreement that would be reasonably expected to preserve such privilege); 
_provided_ that, in the case of clauses (y)(III) and (z), Purchaser or Seller,
as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to make substitute disclosure
arrangements that are reasonably acceptable to the other Party. Purchaser and
Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, conduct their respective activities permitted under this
_Section_ __ _ 4.04(d)_ in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the other Party and such other Partys
Affiliates.

(e) Other than Purchasers right to consent to or withhold consent with
respect to the actions described in _Section_ __ _ 4.01_, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of any other Party prior to the Closing and,
prior to the Closing, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its subsidiaries respective operations.

 

4.05 _Exclusivity_. Seller agrees that between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing, or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _
VII_, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and instruct its and
their Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or
initiate the submission of proposals or offers from, provide any confidential
information to, or participate in discussions or negotiations or enter into
any Contract with any Person (other than Purchaser and its Affiliates)
concerning (i) the sale, lease or transfer of any equity interests in the
Bank Entities or

 



-52- 

    

 all or substantially all of the assets thereof or (ii) any merger, sale,
consolidation or any similar transaction involving the Bank Entities by any
Person other than the Purchaser or its Affiliates (each of (i) and (ii), a "
_Third-Party Transaction_ "). Seller shall immediately cease, and cause its
Affiliates and instruct its Representative to immediately cease, any
discussions, negotiations or communications with respect to any Third-Party
Transaction, and Seller shall notify Purchaser as promptly as practicable of
any inquiries or proposals that are received by Seller with respect to any
Third-Party Transaction and of any discussions, negotiations, requests for
information or other communications with respect to any Third-Party
Transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 4.05_ shall
not apply to, or limit or restrict the Parties or their respective Affiliates
from providing information to any Governmental Authority with regulatory or
supervisory authority over such Party or its Affiliates.

 

4.06 _Notice of Changes_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall promptly advise Seller, and Seller shall promptly advise
Purchaser of, (1) any change or event that would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of Purchasers or
Sellers, as applicable, representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement or (2) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to
the Knowledge of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, any governmental
complaints, any change or event, including investigations or hearings (or

respect to receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals on a timely basis or
the institution or the threat of significant litigation, that would prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Partys
failure to comply with its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 4.06_
shall not provide the other Party with a right not to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except, in each case, to the extent that the
underlying material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant would
independently provide such right.

4.07 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.07(c)_, from and
after the date hereof and continuing thereafter, each of Seller and Purchaser

confidential all information and data that the other (whether Seller or
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) furnishes or otherwise
makes available to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or its respective
Affiliates or Representatives whether before, on or after the date of this
Agreement (and, following the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and Representatives to, keep confidential all information and
data relating to any Bank Entity, any of their respective businesses, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities), including any technical,
scientific, Trade Secret or other proprietary information of the other Party

other form, together with any reports, analyses, compilations, forecasts,
memoranda, notes, studies and any other written or electronic materials
prepared by or for Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or its respective
Affiliates or Representatives, that contain, incorporate, reflect or are based
upon or generated from such information, including all copies, electronic or
otherwise, and reproductions thereof (collectively, " _Confidential
Information_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, may disclose Confidential Information (1) to its
respective Affiliates, and to Representatives of Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, and its respective Affiliates, who need to know such information
for the purpose of assisting Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreements so long as Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, causes its
respective Affiliates and Representatives to treat the Confidential
Information in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof
( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, will be
responsible for any breach of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ by any
of its respective Affiliates or Representatives); (2) to a Governmental

public disclosure of any such information, Seller shall be provided a
reasonable opportunity to review the inclusion of Seller or Bank Entity

Seller in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the term "Confidential Information" will not
include information that (A) is or becomes available to Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, or its respective Affiliates or Representatives, if,
to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Seller, as applicable, such other source
(x) lawfully obtained possession of such information and (y) is not bound by a
confidentiality obligation covering the relevant information or otherwise
prohibited from disclosing the relevant information to Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable or (B) is or becomes generally available to the public (other

-54- 

    

(b) If Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or any of its respective Affiliates
or Representatives is required to disclose any Confidential Information by
Law or legal process, or in connection with a judicial, regulatory or

will, and will cause its respective Affiliates and instruct its
Representatives to, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law (including
Laws relating to the exchange of information), give the other Party prompt and
prior written notice of such requirement. Such Party also agrees, to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law (including Laws relating to the
exchange of information) and reasonably practicable under the circumstances,
to, and to cause its Affiliates and direct its Representatives to, give the
other Party, in advance of any such disclosure, a reasonable description of
the Confidential Information that such Party or its respective Affiliates or
Representatives intends to disclose (and, if applicable, the text of the
disclosure language itself) and to reasonably cooperate with the other Party
(at the other Partys expense) to the extent that the other Party seeks to
limit such disclosure, including, if requested in writing by such other Party,
taking all reasonable steps necessary to limit such disclosure. If and to the
extent that, in the absence of a protective order, other remedy, or the
receipt of a waiver from the other Party after a request in writing therefor
is made by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable (such request to be made as soon
as reasonably practicable to allow the other Party a reasonable amount of
time to respond), Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or its respective
Affiliates or Representatives are legally required, as advised by counsel in
writing, to disclose Confidential Information, such Party will, and will cause
its respective Affiliates and instruct its Representatives to, limit such
disclosure to that which, as advised by counsel, is legally required and will
use reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment
will be accorded to any Confidential Information that such Party or its
respective Affiliates or Representatives is so required to disclose. Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, will not oppose
action by the other Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any
Confidential Information.

(c) Following the Closing, any confidentiality obligations of Purchaser,
including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_, and any related obligations of
Purchaser under _Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_, with respect to Confidential
Information of the Bank Entities, their respective businesses, the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that
Purchaser and its Affiliates are not acquiring and shall continue to keep
confidential, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.07(a)_ and subject to
_Section_ __ _ 4.07(b)_, and not use for their own purposes, any information
to the extent that it relates primarily to Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Bank Entities their respective businesses, the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities) that Purchaser or its Affiliates received in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
through the books and records of the Bank Entities).

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.07_ will supersede any
conflicting provision in the mutual confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreement, dated January 29, 2019, between Seller and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (but which will, for the avoidance of doubt,
continue otherwise in full force and effect).

(a) From the date hereof and continuing through the Closing and thereafter for
a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall

is, as of the date hereof or as of the Closing, an employee or officer of any
Bank Entity, (y) any Business Employee or (z) any person who is, as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing, an employee or officer of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates who Seller became aware of in connection with its
consideration and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreements (clauses (x)-(z), the " _Restricted
Employees_ "); _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.08(a)(1)_
shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from (i) making general
solicitations for employment not specifically targeted at employees of
Purchaser or the Bank Entities and hiring any person who responds as a result
of such general solicitations or (ii) soliciting for employment or hiring any
person who is not a Restricted Employee or any Restricted Employee whose

after the Closing, (2) solicit any customers or clients of the Bank Entities
resident or domiciled in Puerto Rico for retail banking or retail
consumer finance products and services or (3) solicit any Person known to be

products or services available from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, any Bank Entity) from a source other than
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or to reduce or refrain from doing
business with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.08(b)_, nothing in this _Section_ __ _
4.08(a)(3)_ shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from (x) making
general solicitations for the purchase of products or services offered by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Bank Entity) and doing
business with any person who either responds to such general solicitations or
who contacts Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Bank Entity) on
his or her own initiative; or (y) soliciting for any products and services or
providing any products and services to any person who is, at any given time
after the Closing, a customer of both Purchaser or the Bank Entities, on the
one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand.

 

(b) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, except as expressly

avoidance of doubt, wealth management services to high-net worth Persons

the contrary in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 4.08(b)_ will not

or holding a passive investment of up to 5% of the outstanding equity
securities of any entity, including those engaged in Restricted Activities;
(B) owning, holding or exercising, in the ordinary course of business

Restricted Activities do not exceed ten percent (10%) of such acquired
Persons total consolidated revenue in the last completed fiscal year or (F)
continuing to operate any Acquired Business that Seller or any of its
Affiliates purchased or acquired in accordance with clause (E) so long as,
during the term of this _Section_ __ _ 4.08(b)_, the aggregate consolidated
revenues of the Restricted Activities of such Acquired Business do not exceed
ten percent (10%) of such Acquired Businesss total consolidated revenue
during any twelve (12) month period.

 

(c) From the date hereof and continuing through the Closing and thereafter for
a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, (1) directly or indirectly solicit for
employment or hire any person who is, as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date, an employee or officer of Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Bank Entities) and who Purchaser became aware of in connection with its
consideration and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless such person is a Business Employee or a USVI Branch Employee
(as defined in the USVI Purchase Agreement) or (2) use any information of
Seller and its Affiliates that (x) Purchaser knows is information that relates
to customers solely of Seller and its Affiliates (other than any Bank Entity),
other than any Branch Customer (as defined in the PR Purchase Agreement) or
any customer of any of the Branches (as defined in the USVI Purchase
Agreement) and (y) is retained by the Bank Entities to solicit, for banking,
lending or other financial services, any such customer or client of Seller or
any of its Affiliates described in clause (x) above following the Closing
Date; _provided_ that (A) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.08(c)_ shall
prohibit Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from (i) making general
solicitations for

 



-57- 

    

 employment not specifically targeted at employees of Seller or its
Affiliates and hiring any such person who responds as a result of such general
solicitations or (ii) soliciting for employment or hiring any person whose
employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates has been terminated by Seller
or such Affiliates (but not voluntarily by such Person) any time after the
Closing, and (B) nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.08(c)_ shall prohibit
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from (x) making general solicitations for
the purchase of products or services offered by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates and doing business with any Person who either responds to such
general solicitations or who contacts Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on
his, her or its own initiative; or (y) soliciting for any products and
services or providing any products and services to any Person who is, at any
given time after the Closing, a customer of both Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or the Bank Entities, on the other
hand.

 

(d) The Parties recognize that the territorial, time and scope limitations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ are reasonable and are properly required
for the protection of the Parties legitimate interests in client and employee
relationships, goodwill and Trade Secrets. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event of a breach or threatened breach of the obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 4.08_ by (1) Seller or any of its Affiliates, Purchaser, in
addition to all other available remedies, shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to enforce the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.08_ in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.09_ and (2) Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, Seller, in addition to all other available remedies, shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to enforce the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.08_ in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.09_.

4.09  _Intercompany Agreements; Release of Guaranties and Certain Other
Obligations_.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (1) the Bank Entities and Seller
(and any of their applicable Affiliates) will enter into one or more mutual
termination and release agreements, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, pursuant to which all Contracts between the Bank
Entities, on the one hand, and Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than
the Bank Entities), on the other hand, whether relating to products, services
or support provided to or by the Bank Entities or otherwise, shall be
terminated as of the Closing without any (x) continuing obligation or
liability on the part of any party thereto, (y) any termination penalty or (z)
any other payment of value by any Bank Entity other than, in the case of this
clause (z), payments (i) in respect of services provided to the Bank prior to
such termination in amounts and on terms consistent with past practice and the
terms of the applicable Contracts being terminated or (ii) required to settle
financial obligations existing as part of the Contracts ongoing terms and
(2) unless otherwise provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement,
the Bank Entities shall not be entitled to receive any products, services or
support covered by such Contracts following the Closing. At or prior to the
Closing, all Intercompany Receivables and Intercompany Payables shall be
settled or paid in accordance with their terms.

 



-58- 

    

(b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Bank Entities and Seller (and
any of their applicable Affiliates) may terminate, at or prior to the
Closing, any guaranty, letter of credit, indemnity, performance or surety bond
or similar credit support arrangement issued by or for the account of Seller
or its Affiliates (other than the Bank Entities) with respect to the Bank
Entities (" _Credit Support Arrangements_ "). If any material Credit Support
Agreement (other than those listed in Section 4.09(b) of the Bank Disclosure
Schedule) is identified after the date of this Agreement the Parties will
work in good faith to agree on a transition plan (including the posting of
collateral by Purchaser with respect to its obligations to Seller in the event
of Purchasers default), and, if required, Purchaser shall find substitute
credit support as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within
twelve (12) months after Closing.

 

(c) Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to transfer to Purchaser all of
Sellers right, title and interest in, to and under the Contract listed in
Section 4.09(c) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules at the Closing. Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser for Purchaser to obtain, from the FDIC, an assignment
of the power of attorney referenced in Section 3.02(f)(1) of the
Bank Disclosure Schedules or an issuance by the FDIC to Purchaser of a new
power of attorney conferring the same authority granted by the power of
attorney referenced in Section 3.02(f)(1) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules.

 

4.10 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
transfer the employment of each active Business Employee not already employed
by the Bank Entities to one of the Bank Entities, other than those individuals
set forth on Section 4.10(a)(i) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule. As of the
Closing, the Bank Entities will have no employee who is not a Business
Employee, other than those individuals set forth on Section 4.10(a)(ii) of
the Bank Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or as
required by applicable non-U.S. Law, Purchaser shall not assume any
obligations under or liabilities with respect to, or receive any right or
interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance,
administration or other Contracts pertaining to any Business Benefit Plan
sponsored or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Bank
Entities) (" _Seller Plans_ "). Seller and the applicable Seller Plans shall
retain, promptly pay, and discharge all liabilities under or with respect to
each Seller Plan in accordance with the terms thereof (including terms related
to the amendment or termination thereof) and any other benefit or
compensation plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
sponsored or maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding than the
Bank Entities), regardless of when such liabilities arise or are incurred or
reported. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by
applicable Law, Seller shall cause each Continuing Employee to cease
participating in and accruing additional benefits or service credit under any
Seller Plan, effective as of the Closing Date, and shall cause the Bank
Entities to cease to be participating employers in any Seller Plan effective
as of the Closing Date. Seller shall cause each participant in any Seller
Plans who is not a Continuing Employee (or a beneficiary or dependent
thereof) to cease participating in and accruing additional benefits or service
credit under all Bank Benefit Plans except those set forth on Section 4.10(b)
of the Bank Disclosure Schedules, effective as of the Closing Date.

 



-59- 

    

(c) If requested by the Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall cause Bank to take all actions necessary to
terminate Banks tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the "
_Bank Retirement Plan_ "), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as
of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and
contingent upon the Closing, and provide that participants in the Bank
Retirement Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of his or
her Bank Retirement Plan account as of the date such plan is terminated.
Seller shall provide Purchaser with evidence reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser that the Bank Retirement Plan has been terminated (effective no
later than immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent on the
Closing). If the Bank Retirement Plan is terminated, then Purchaser shall
designate a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan of the
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of the Purchaser) with a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 1081.01(a) of the PR Code that will cover
Continuing Employees on and after the Closing Date (" _Purchaser Retirement
Plan_ ") and such Purchaser Retirement Plan shall permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions (including rollover of loans), in the
form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof, in an
amount equal to the full account balance distributed or distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Bank Retirement Plan to the Purchaser Retirement
Plan, to the extent permitted under the PR Code.

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that, following the Closing, certain Continuing
Employees will continue to hold equity awards in Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Bank Entities) (the " _Participants_ "), which will
continue to vest in accordance with their terms contingent upon the holders
continued employment with the Bank Entities (or any successor entity
thereto). Purchaser will timely notify Seller when a Participants employment
with the Bank Entities terminates. Purchaser and Seller will cooperate prior
to the Closing to identify a process for timely reporting to the
appropriate taxing authorities any income recognizable by any such
Participant associated with the vesting, transfer or disposition of such
Participants equity awards, and timely withhold and remit any associated
income or employment taxes (including the employer portion of any associated
payroll taxes). Purchaser shall be fully indemnified by Seller for any taxes,
fees, costs, penalties, interest or other amounts incurred by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Bank Entities) related to the Sellers
equity awards.

(e) Purchaser agrees that each Business Employee of the Bank Entities at the
Closing who continues to remain employed with the Bank Entities (or any
successor entity thereto) immediately following the Closing (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Closing
Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, be
provided during the term of their employment with the Bank Entities

 



-60- 

    

 (or any successor entity thereto) with (1) base salary or base wage and
target annual cash bonus opportunities that are, in each case, no less
favorable than base salary/wage and target annual cash bonus opportunities
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date by the Bank Entities, and (2) severance benefits and retirement, health
and welfare benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based plans, defined
benefit plans and post-retirement health and welfare benefit plans) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the severance benefits and
retirement, health and welfare benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based
plans, defined benefit plans and post-retirement health and welfare benefit
plans) provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date by the Bank Entities.

 

(f) The rejection by any Business Employee of the automatic transfer of
employment to Purchaser by virtue of the Stock Sale shall be deemed
a voluntary resignation. Such voluntary resignation will not entitle the
Business Employee to severance or termination-related payments, benefits or
notices from the Bank Entities, the Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser,
including but not limited to, statutory severance or any payments or benefits
under any compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements that may be
established or maintained by Purchaser or required to be paid under applicable
Law. If the transfer of an individual to an entity other than the Bank
Entities or the termination of any individual set forth in Section 4.10(a)(ii)
of the Bank Disclosure Schedules entitles such individual to any notice,
termination or severance payments under the existing terms of an applicable
Business Benefit Plan or as required by U.S. or non-U.S. Law, then Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates for any such
notice, termination and severance payments.

(g) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to (1) cause any eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(collectively, " _New Plans_ ") to be waived with respect to the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent coverage under group
health plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Business Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Closing
Date (collectively, " _Old Plans_ "), (2) cause any pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or limitations under any New Plans to be waived with respect to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(3) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year of any New Plan in
which the Closing occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-
pocket limits under such New Plan in which the Continuing Employee
participates for any eligible medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing
during the plan year of the Old Plan in which the Closing occurs for which
payment has been made, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan, and (4) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Bank Entities and their Affiliates
for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under
each applicable benefit plan of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
vacation accrual and severance benefit 

 



-61- 

    

 determinations), as if such service had been performed with Purchaser or the
applicable Affiliate, except under defined benefit pension plans, under
retiree medical plans, for the purposes of qualifying for subsidized early
retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, Purchaser shall
credit, and every Continuing Employee shall retain accrued but unused time-
off entitlements, including vacation and sick leave balances, as applicable,
accrued under Sellers policies and programs immediately prior to the Closing
Date and /or accrued balances of paid time-off or similar programs with
Seller as of the Closing Date, which such accruals shall be provided to
Purchaser no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(h) Prior to the Closing, before making any written or oral communications to
the directors, officers or employees of the Bank Entities pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of
the intended communication, Seller shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on the communication, and Purchaser shall consider any
such comments in good faith.

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Business Benefit Plan, (2) prevent Purchaser, the
Bank Entities or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans or, after the Closing, any Bank Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms, (3) prevent Purchaser, the Bank Entities or any
of their Affiliates, after the Closing, from terminating the employment of any
Continuing Employee, or (4) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
employee of the Bank Entities, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Purchaser, the Bank Entities or any of
their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Purchaser, the Bank Entities
or any of their Affiliates may maintain. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser
shall be responsible for any labor and employment-related liability related
to the post-Closing employment of the Business Employees, including any post-
Closing termination of such employees.

 

(j) Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree to the covenants and
agreements set forth in Section 4.10(j)-(p) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules.

4.11 _Further Assurances_. Before, at and after the Closing, consistent with
the terms and conditions hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall and shall cause
each of their respective subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their Affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge and
deliver such instruments, certificates and other documents and take such
other action as a Party may reasonably require in order to carry out any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Following the Closing, the Parties shall
cooperate with one another to prepare and file all documents and forms
and amendments thereto as may be required by applicable Law with respect to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

 



-62- 

    

4.12 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Returns and Reports_.

 

(1) Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns with respect to the Bank
Entities that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date.

(2) Following Closing, Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Bank
Entities that are not Tax Returns that Seller is required to file or cause to
be filed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.12(a)(1)_, and Purchaser shall remit
or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Except
for any (i) Closing Agreement Purchaser Taxes or (ii) Tax accruals on income
derived in the ordinary course of business between the date hereof and the
Closing Date (provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, Tax accruals on
income derived in the ordinary course of business will not include (A) any Tax
accruals attributable to the termination of the Shared-Loss Agreements or any
other loss sharing agreement, (B) any Tax accruals attributable to a
disposition of assets to fund any Pre-Closing Dividends and (C) any Tax
accruals attributable to the termination or settlement of the Closing
Agreements), Seller shall pay Purchaser the portion of Taxes shown to be due
on a Tax Return of the Purchaser or the Bank Entities which are allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period
and attributable to a Bank Entity, within fifteen (15) days of the due date
for such Taxes;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in computing the amount of
Taxes (if any) for which Seller is responsible pursuant to the foregoing,
Seller shall be entitled to include in the pre-Closing portion of
the relevant Straddle Period all Tax benefits relating to Transaction
Deductions and any deductions, credits and any other tax attributes of the
Bank Entities from Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date (other than any such deductions, credits or other tax attributes
either (i) resulting from Transaction Expenses not paid in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.22_ or (ii) accrued or otherwise reflected as Tax
receivables or prepaid Taxes on the Financial Statements), to the extent that
such Tax benefits or deductions, credits or other tax attributes properly
reduced Taxes reflected on the Tax Return for such Straddle Period. Purchaser
shall provide Seller with a copy of a draft of each Straddle Period Tax
Return for its review and comment (i) at least forty-five (45) days prior to
the filing of such Tax Return or (ii) in the case of a Tax Return that is
required to be filed within twenty (20) days of the Closing Date, at least 10
days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed; _provided_
that in the case of a Tax Return that is required to be filed within ten (10)
days of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall afford Seller a reasonable
opportunity to review such Straddle Period Tax Return prior to filing such Tax

 



-63- 

    

 Return. If Seller and Purchaser disagree as to any item reflected on any
Straddle Period Tax Return, such items will be determined by a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm selected by mutual agreement of Seller
and Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, (A) the amount of ad valorem (real property and personal property)
Taxes and other Taxes not described in clause (B) below of the Bank Entities
for the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date shall be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in such Straddle Period, and (B) the amount of any sales
or use Taxes, value-added Taxes, employment related Taxes, withholding Taxes
and Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts or profits of the Bank
Entities for the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books on the Closing Date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Closing Agreement
Purchaser Taxes are Taxes allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser
shall be responsible for any Closing Agreement Purchaser Taxes regardless of
when such Taxes arise or are reflected on a Tax Return. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties agree that Closing Agreement Purchaser Taxes shall not
include any Taxes to the extent resulting from or attributable to (i) the
settlement of the Closing Agreements at the request of Seller or Bank, or
(ii) any action or inaction by Seller or its Affiliates prior to March 1,
2019.

(3) Purchaser shall cause the Bank Entities to promptly furnish information
to Seller as reasonably requested by Seller to allow Seller to satisfy its
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 4.12(a)_.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Refunds; Certain Obligations of Purchaser_.

 

(1) Except for any Closing Agreement Refunds, Purchaser shall pay Seller any
Tax refund or credit in lieu of a refund (including any interest paid or
credited by a taxing authority with respect thereto) relating to Taxes in
respect of the Bank Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or of Pre-Closing
Taxes (as defined in each of the Purchase Agreements) within fifteen (15) days
of the receipt of such refund; provided, however, that in computing the amount
of refunds (if any) which Purchaser shall pay pursuant to the foregoing,
Purchaser shall be entitled to exclude any refund or credit in lieu of a
refund that is (i) attributable to, or resulting from, a carryback or other
use of any item of loss, deduction, credit or other similar item arising in a
taxable period after the Closing Date or (ii) accrued or otherwise reflected
as Tax receivables or prepaid Taxes on the Financial Statements. Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Bank Entities or other
relevant entity to file for and obtain the receipt of any refund to which
Seller is entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 4.12(b)(1)_. Purchaser shall
promptly notify Seller in writing of the receipt or availability of any such
Tax refund and shall keep Seller informed of the status of any such Tax
refund. If any Tax refund or credit in

 



-64- 

    

 lieu of a refund (including any interest paid or credited by a taxing
authority with respect thereto) paid over to Seller pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.12(b)(1)_ is subsequently denied, disallowed or reduced, Seller shall
promptly repay the amount so denied, reduced or disallowed to Purchaser. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that Closing Agreement Refunds are
refunds allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall be entitled
to any Closing Agreement Refunds regardless of when such refunds arise.

(2) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and shall
not cause or permit the Bank Entities or any of their other Affiliates to (A)
amend any Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the
pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period or (B) make any Tax election that
would have retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-
Closing portion of a Straddle Period.

 

(c) _Mutual Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.04_: 

(1) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist) the other Party
in preparing any Tax Returns of the Bank Entities;

(2) cooperate fully in preparing for any audit of, or dispute with, any taxing
authority regarding, any Tax Return of the Bank Entities;

(3) make available to the other Party and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
of the Bank Entities;

(4) provide timely notice to the other Party in writing of any pending or
threatened tax audit or assessment of the Bank Entities for Taxes for which
the other Party may have a liability; and

 

(5) furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence received from
any taxing authority in connection with any audit or information request with
respect to the Bank Entities for Taxes for which the other Party may have a
liability.

(d) _Contest Provisions_.

(1) Subject to the next sentence, with respect to any Tax Contest (except for
any Tax Contests governed by  _Section_ __ _ 4.25_ and Section 4.25 of the
Bank Disclosure Schedules) that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Seller shall control, at its own expense, proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax Contest (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting
the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego

 



-65- 

    

 any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences
with any taxing authority with respect thereto and may, at its own expense and
in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax and sue for a refund where
applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Contest in any
permissible manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Tax
Contest described in the preceding sentence, Seller shall not (i) settle,
compromise or abandon any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, to the extent that an adverse determination in such Tax
Contest would result in a material Tax liability of Purchaser, the Bank
Entities or any of their Affiliates in a Tax period that ends after the
Closing, or could resolve an issue that could reasonably be expected to recur
in a subsequent period, the resolution of which could bind or reasonably
prejudice the resolution of such issue in any subsequent period or (ii)
conduct any such Tax Contest in a manner that could result in material
disruptions for Purchaser or any Bank Entity (for example, by contesting a
Tax prior to payment in a manner that prevents Purchaser or any Bank Entity
from receiving withholding clearance certificates or other documentation from
an applicable taxing authority that are necessary to conduct its operations
or avoid the imposition or collection of material Taxes on an ongoing basis).

(2) Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest
that relates to a Straddle Period (except for any Tax Contests governed by
_Section_ __ _ 4.25_ and Section 4.25 of the Bank Disclosure Schedules) so
long as the matter does not relate to federal Taxes or state, local or
foreign income Taxes applicable to the Bank Entities or Seller (or Affiliate)
for any period prior to the Closing Date. If a Tax Contest (except for any Tax
Contests governed by  _Section_ __ _ 4.25_ and Section 4.25 of the Bank
Disclosure Schedules) that relates to a Straddle Period does relate to federal
Taxes or state, local or foreign income Taxes applicable to the Bank Entities
or Seller, the Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to
conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Contest, provided that (i) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of the status of such Tax Contest, (ii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax Contest, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the
Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax Contest, (iv) the
Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest,
(v) the Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise, or abandon any such
Tax Contest without obtaining the prior written consent of the Non-Controlling
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (vi) the Controlling Party shall not conduct any such Tax Contest
in a manner that could result in material disruptions for Purchaser or any
Bank Entity (for example, by contesting a Tax prior to payment in a manner
that prevents Purchaser or any Bank Entity from receiving withholding
clearance certificates or other documentation from an applicable Taxing
authority

 



-66- 

    

 that are necessary to conduct its operations or avoid the imposition or
collection of material Taxes on an ongoing basis). For purposes of this
paragraph, " _Controlling Party_ " shall mean Seller, unless Purchaser is
reasonably expected to bear the materially greater Tax liability in connection
with a Tax Contest described in this paragraph, in which case Purchaser shall
be the Controlling Party; and " _Non-Controlling Party_" shall mean whichever
Party is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Contest.

 

(3) The failure of any Party to give any notice required under _Section_ __ _
4.12(c)(4)_ shall not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 4.12_ except to the extent that the other Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser and Seller shall each be liable for 50% of any
transfer, stamp, documentary, registration, sales, use tax and other similar
Taxes and any conveyance fee, recording charge and other fees and charges
(together with any penalties and interest, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred as a
result of the transfers effected pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(f) _Restrictive Covenants_. The restrictive covenants contained in _Section_
__ _ 4.08_ (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ ") are being granted to maintain
and preserve the fair market value of the Shares transferred by Seller to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that:
(i) no proceeds shall be received or receivable by Seller or any other Person
for granting the Restrictive Covenants and (ii) the Restrictive Covenants are
integral to this Agreement.

 

4.13 _Pre-Closing Dividend_ _s_. Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause Bank to make (1) the Pre-Closing Primary
Dividend; and (2) secondarily to the Pre-Closing Primary Dividend, one or more
dividends or distributions to Seller in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$125,000,000.00 (the " _Pre-Closing Secondary Dividend_" and together with the
Pre-Closing Primary Dividend, the " _Pre-Closing Dividends_") and to obtain
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals set forth in Section 5.02(d) of the Bank
Disclosure Schedules. In connection with the Pre-Closing Primary Dividend,
Bank will redeem any of the shares of Second Preferred Stock that are issued
and outstanding.

 

4.14 _Transition Services Agreement_.

 

(a) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will negotiate
in good faith a transition services agreement (the " _Transition Services
Agreement_ ") based on the terms set forth in _Exhibit 1_. Prior to or at the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall enter into the Transition Services
Agreement. Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, commencing at the
Closing, Seller shall provide all services and applications that Seller or any
of its Affiliates provided to the Bank Entities in the twelve (12)-month
period prior to the Closing Date, except for those services (i) that are 

 



-67- 

    

 expressly identified on Section 4.14 of the Bank Disclosure Schedules or
(ii) which Purchaser notifies Seller in writing prior to the Closing Date that
it does not require (referred to as Excluded Services in the Transition
Services Agreement), _provided_ , that, to the extent Sellers ability to
provide any other services is dependent on the continuation of such services
that Purchaser notifies Seller it does not require, and such dependency has
been notified to Purchaser in writing reasonably promptly after receiving such
notice from Purchaser that it does not require such services, then such
services shall not be considered Excluded Services unless Seller also
identifies such services as Excluded Services contemporaneously. Seller
further agrees to provide such information and assistance as is reasonably
necessary to facilitate Purchasers review and assessment of such services.
The Parties agree to take such actions contemplated by the following sections
of Transition Services Agreement term sheet that are expressly required prior
to the Closing Date: "Use of Third-Party Providers or Resources"
and "Alternative Arrangements". Any modifications of such provisions
reflected in the Transition Services Agreement shall be deemed effective as
the date of this Agreement for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.14_.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.14_, "Bank Entities" shall be deemed
to include the PR Branch and the Branches.

 

(b) The Parties will in good faith develop and agree on a transition plan (the
" _Transition Plan_ ") within sixty (60) days after date of this Agreement.
The Transition Plan will consist of a detailed plan for (i) transitioning Bank
and the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities to Purchaser, including the
specific tasks, activities, and projects, and the timing for each of the
foregoing, to be completed by each Party prior to the Closing in order to
complete such transition in an orderly and efficient manner, as well as such
plans and actions as may be required to prepare for the provision of services
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) by Seller to Purchaser
under the Transition Services Agreement); and (ii) identifying and completing
any activities necessary for Seller to separate or segregate Bank and the
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities from Seller and Sellers systems. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each Party will appoint three (iii) initial
representatives to serve on a transition plan committee (the " _Transition
Plan Committee_ ") that will be ultimately responsible for oversight,
coordination and implementation of the Transition Plan (with such governance
functions as may be agreed between the Parties). Each Party shall be entitled
to remove and replace representatives on the Transition Plan Committee as it
deems appropriate. The Transition Plan will also identify the responsibility
of each of the Parties for any costs associated with the implementation of the
Transition Plan (to the extent not already specified in the Transition
Services Agreement term sheet set forth in _Exhibit 1_ , subject to the
general principle that costs associated with (x) Sellers internal separation
of Bank and Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, including the delivery
of data to Purchaser in formats currently maintained by Seller, will be at
Sellers cost and (y) modifications to Sellers systems, processes and
facilities, data mapping, development and other modifications to Sellers or
Banks data requested by Purchaser in order to be received by Purchaser will
be at Purchasers cost.

the extent that any of the know-how, trade secrets, methods or processes __
owned by the Bank Entities immediately after the Closing was used by Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Bank Entities) before the
Closing, Purchaser hereby grants to Seller and its Affiliates, effective as
of the Closing, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (other
than to Sellers Affiliates and service providers, in each case, acting in
their capacity as such), perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free,
fully paid-up right and license in, to and under such know-how, trade secrets,
methods and processes, including the right to (x) make, have made, use,
import, offer for sale, lease, sell and/or otherwise transfer or dispose of
any products or services for use in its and its Affiliates business, and (y)

distribute, modify, prepare derivative works based on and otherwise exploit
any and all of such know-how, trade secrets, methods or processes.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing between the Parties, to
the extent that any of the know-how, trade secrets, methods or processes __
owned by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Bank Entities)
immediately after the Closing was used by any Bank Entity as of the Closing,
but excluding (i) any Trademarks; (ii) Intellectual Property subject to the
Transition Services Agreement; (iii) Intellectual Property related to the Bank
Entities general business infrastructure and operations (e.g.,
Intellectual Property related to human resources, internal accounts payable,
policies and procedures, handbooks, internal guidelines, management policies,
internal management governance and internal treasury services and similar
Intellectual Property); and (iv) Excluded Books and Records (such know-how,
trade secrets, methods and processes, excluding the exclusions set forth in
(i)-(iv), __ " _Background IP_ "), Seller and its Affiliates hereby grant to
the Bank Entities, effective as of the Closing, a non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable (other than to Purchasers Affiliates and
service providers, in each case, acting in their capacity as such), perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up right and license in, to
and under such Background IP, solely to continue to conduct the businesses of
the Bank Entities, including the right to (A) make, have made, use, import,
offer for sale, lease, sell and/or otherwise transfer or dispose of any
products or services for use in its and its Affiliates business, and (B)
use, reproduce, display (publicly or otherwise), perform, transmit,
distribute, modify, prepare derivative works based on and otherwise exploit
any and all of such Intellectual Property. To the extent that rights in or to
any Background IP is necessary for Purchasers or its Affiliates internal use
of the Books and Records, Seller and its Affiliates hereby grant, effective as
of the applicable Purchase Agreement Closing, a non-exclusive, non-
transferable, non-sublicensable (other than to Purchasers Affiliates and
service providers acting in their capacity as such), perpetual, irrevocable,
worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up right and license under such necessary
Background IP contained in the Books and Records (as defined in the applicable
Purchase Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser, for

 



-69- 

    

 itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser is not
purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining ownership in or to any of the
Trademarks set forth in Section 4.15(c) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules or
any derivative thereof, or any other Trademark incorporating the word
"Scotiabank" or "Scotia" or "The Bank of Nova Scotia" (collectively, the "
_Seller Marks_ "), and, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.15(c)_,
following the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including
the Bank Entities) shall (1) use, display, apply for or register in any
jurisdiction any of the Seller Marks or any other Trademarks that are
confusingly similar thereto, in each case except as expressly permitted under
this _Section_ __ _ 4.15_ or as permitted by applicable Law, or (2) contest
or deny the validity or enforceability of, seek to cancel, or contest Seller
or its Affiliates interest or rights in, any of the Seller Marks.

non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, non-exclusive right and license for the
Bank Entities to use and display the Seller Marks, solely in connection with
the conduct of the business of the Bank Entities in a substantially similar
manner as used and displayed by the Bank Entities immediately prior to
the Closing, (1) in respect of exterior signage, for a period not to exceed
thirty (30) days and (2) for all other usage, for a period not to exceed
ninety (90) days. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchasers right and
license under the Seller Marks shall automatically expire upon the expiration
of such periods, and Purchaser and its subsidiaries shall cease all customer-
or public-facing use and display of the Seller Marks. On or prior to the
expiration of such period, Purchaser shall (i) replace or destroy all
materials bearing or incorporating the Seller Marks, including signage,
advertising, promotional materials, software, packaging, inventory, electronic
materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards and websites (the "
_Materials_ ") or remove, destroy or strike over all Seller Marks from the
Bank Entities Materials, provided, that, Purchaser shall not be responsible
for making any necessary changes in accordance with this section on systems
controlled by Seller, including without limitation any systems used to provide
services under the Transition Services Agreement. Neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall use or display any Seller Marks (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include the use of Seller Marks for marketing or
other mailings) except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.

or after the Closing. Following the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates will be obligated to make any claim under any insurance policy on
behalf of the Bank Entities, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

provided in the constituent documents of the Bank Entities, or in any
indemnification agreement between the Bank Entities and any Indemnified DandO
(in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement and Previously
Disclosed), will survive the Closing and will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of six (6) years
from the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification

Indemnified DandO asserted or made prior to the Closing or within such six-year
period will continue until the final disposition of such civil, criminal or
administrative action.

(b) From and after the Closing until the sixth (6th) anniversary thereof, all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing and rights to advancement of

exculpation or right of advancement of expenses from Purchaser or any of its

omissions, in their capacity as directors and/or officers of the Bank
Entities, occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby) on terms no less favorable to such
Indemnified DandOs than those of the Previously Disclosed insurance policies

with respect to coverage, insurance limits and retention) and with an insurer
or insurers with the same or higher A.M. Best rating as the Bank Entities
current primary directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurer; _provided_ , _however_ , that in complying with its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.17(d)_, Purchaser shall not be required to
expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of the amount set forth

aggregate period of not less than six (6) years following the Closing with
respect to claims arising from acts or omissions that occurred on or prior to
the Closing Date.

assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(2) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and
other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause Bank, as applicable, to make proper provision so that such
successors and assigns expressly assume the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.17_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.17_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified DandO, his or her

such person may have from the Bank Entities or any other person by contract
or otherwise except as expressly provided herein.

and its post-Closing Affiliates (and each of its and their respective heirs,

forever discharges any and all rights, claims and Losses of any type that it
has had, now has or might now or hereafter have against Seller, and each of
their respective individual, joint or mutual, past, present and future
Representatives, Affiliates, stockholders, successors and assigns (each, a "
_Seller Releasee_ "), in each case of (a) and (b), in respect of, relating to

and on behalf of its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced or voluntarily aiding, any proceeding
of any kind against any Purchaser Releasee or Seller Releasee, based upon any
matter purported to be released hereby. The Parties acknowledge that this
_Section_ __ _ 4.18_ is not an admission of liability or of the accuracy of
any alleged fact or claim. The Parties expressly agree that this _Section_ __
_ 4.18_ shall not be construed as an admission in any proceeding as evidence
of or an admission by any Party of any violation or wrongdoing. Without
limiting the effectiveness of the foregoing, upon written request from any
Purchaser Releasee or Seller Releasee made promptly after the Closing, as
applicable, Seller or Purchaser shall confirm (or cause their applicable
controlled Affiliates to confirm) in writing the scope of the foregoing
release.

covenants and obligations under this Agreement and the Purchase Agreements in
accordance with their respective terms.

reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file
shall not affect Parents obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment
to Seller or other performance in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations must
be returned or is rescinded, for any reason whatsoever, Parent shall remain
liable hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations as if such payment
or performance had not been returned or rescinded. Parents obligations
hereunder may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be binding on Parent, its successors and permitted assigns
until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid and performed in full.

 

(c) Parent agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be discharged,
released, diminished or impaired, in whole or in part, by any set-off,
counterclaim, defense, act or occurrence which Parent may have against Seller

any other transaction. Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
4.19_, Parent shall have the rights, remedies and legal or equitable defenses

or restrictions) with respect to any confidential information related to any
Bank Entity or the business of any Bank Entity and any applicable non-
solicitation and non-hire provisions with respect to the Business Employees,
except to the extent such assignment is prohibited by the terms of such Seller
Confidentiality Agreement. As used herein, " _Seller Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means each confidentiality or similar agreement (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) entered into by Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than a Bank Entity) in connection with the consideration of a possible
sale of any Bank Entity or their respective businesses.

4.21 _Disclosure Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall and shall cause each of the Bank
Entities, the PR Branch and the Branches (collectively, the " _Cooperation
Parties_ ") to use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives to, on a timely basis, upon the reasonable request of
Purchaser, provide reasonable cooperation in connection with the
financial statement disclosure requirements (the " _Disclosure Requirements_
") under applicable accounting and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
regulations relating to the transactions contemplated hereunder which may be
applicable to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or
equivalent, but not more burdensome, disclosure made on a private basis prior
to and/or following the Closing (including in connection with any debt and/or
equity financing to be made by Purchaser or Parent, whether prior to or
following the Closing, and the diligence and marketing efforts in connection
therewith) ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of Seller or the Bank
Entities), including, but not limited to, the following:

(1) upon reasonable prior written notice, furnishing, or causing to be
furnished, to Purchaser, (A) the Bank Financial Statements and additional
audited financial statements of Bank for such further Bank Entity fiscal years
ended at least seventy five (75) days prior to the Closing Date, and audited
statements of income and cash flows for the three most recently completed
fiscal years of the Bank Entities and the Bank Entities further fiscal years
ended at least seventy five (75) days prior to the Closing Date; and (B)
unaudited balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows for
each Bank Entity fiscal quarter ended after the close of its most recent Bank
Entity fiscal year which are no more than one hundred and twenty nine (129)
days old at Closing and the corresponding Bank Entity fiscal quarter for the
preceding Bank Entity fiscal year and prepared in accordance with GAAP and, at
the request of Purchaser, reviewed (SAS 100) by accountants retained by 

 



-74- 

    

 Purchaser (or by the Bank Entities at the request of Purchaser) (with such
review (x) including a review of the financial statements for the
corresponding period in the previous Bank Entity fiscal year and (y) being
conducted in accordance with applicable accounting standards, including
Regulation S-X), in the case of each of (A) and (B), that would be required to
be included in a registration statement required to be filed by Parent
pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X in connection with the Disclosure
Requirements ( _it_ _being_   _understood_ that reasonable prior written
notice shall not be required for the furnishing of financial statements or
other financial information ordinarily prepared with respect to the Bank
Entities (but, for the avoidance doubt, Seller and the Bank Entities will not
be required to furnish such financial statements earlier than prepared in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice) and that quarterly statements
of income and cash flows are not ordinarily prepared and SAS 100 reviews are
not ordinary conducted with respect to the Bank Entities financial
statements);

(2) providing reasonable cooperation in the mutual preparation by Parent,
Purchaser, Seller and the Cooperation Parties of financial statements or other
financial information in respect of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities that would be required to be included in a registration statement
on Form S-1 filed by Parent pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X in
connection with the Disclosure Requirements, it being understood that such

Seller will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Specified Action without the prior written

Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) Except with respect to Tax Contests, which are covered by _Section_ __ _
4.12(d)_, the Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time, by
delivering written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume and thereafter
(at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party unless expressly provided
otherwise in this _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_) conduct the defense of the Third-
Party Claim in its sole discretion with counsel of its choice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or
proposed settlement (1) involves only the payment of money damages against
which the Indemnified Party is indemnified by the Indemnifying Party, (2)
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party (unless such relief is ministerial in nature) and (3) does not involve a
finding or admission of any violation of Law or other wrongdoing by the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a

 



-85- 

    

 Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will have the right, but not the
obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing at its own expense (the cost of which, for the avoidance of
doubt, will not be indemnifiable Losses); _provided_ that if the Indemnified
Party is advised in writing by outside counsel that an actual or potential
conflict of interest (including one or more legal defenses or counterclaims
being available to such Indemnified Party or other Indemnified Parties which
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party)
would make it inappropriate under applicable ethical rules for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
with respect to the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party. Provided that an Indemnified Party has
given the Indemnifying Party notice of a Third-Party Claim as required
hereunder, if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of the Third-
Party Claim, (x) the Indemnified Party shall defend against the Third-Party
Claim, (y) the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable and
documented fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party during any period in which the Indemnifying Party has not elected to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim and (z) the Indemnifying Party shall
be bound by any final determination with respect to such Third-Party Claim
prior to its assumption; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party
may not agree to any settlement without the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party by
providing records and information on a timely basis that are reasonably
relevant to any Third-Party Claim and shall in good faith consult with counsel
for the other Party; _provided_ that no Party shall be required to take any
such action to the extent doing so would jeopardize any applicable attorney-
client or work product privileges.

(c) If Purchaser is the Indemnified Party, Purchaser shall use reasonable
best efforts to seek recovery under all Bank Insurance Policies that are in
effect during any period of coverage prepaid by Bank prior to Closing covering
the applicable Loss.

 

(d) The amount of any Losses of any Indemnified Party under this _Article_ __
_ VI_ shall be reduced by the amount, if any, (1) received by the
Indemnified Party from any third Person (including, without limitation, any
insurance company or other insurance provider (such amount being referred to
herein as a " _Third-Party Reimbursement_ ")), in respect of the Losses
suffered thereby net of all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred
by the Indemnified Party in recovering such Third-Party Reimbursement and (2)
of any reduction in Taxes actually realized by the Indemnified Party, in the
taxable year in which such Loss is paid. If, after receipt by an Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder, such Person receives a Third-
Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses (whether in whole or in
part) for which indemnification was made and such Third-Party Reimbursement
was not taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over all or the relevant portion of
such Third-Party Reimbursement (net of all documented costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in recovering such Third-Party
Reimbursement) to the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of the
indemnification paid pursuant hereto.

 



-86- 

    

6.05 _Damages_. For the avoidance of doubt, in calculating any Losses or
alleged Losses with respect to any item or matter, an Indemnified Party will
not be entitled to include in Losses any amount for which there was a reserve
on Banks consolidated balance sheet of December 31, 2018 that is directly
attributable to such item or matter. No Party shall be liable under this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreements for (1) any consequential damages unless
such damages were reasonably foreseeable or (2) without limiting the
foregoing, any punitive, special, incidental, exemplary or indirect damages,
or any lost revenue, lost profits, loss of business reputation or loss of
opportunity, or for any damages that are speculative or not reasonably
determinable, except, in each case of clauses (1) and (2), to the extent such
Losses are awarded by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in
connection with a Third-Party Claim. Any Indemnified Party that becomes
aware of a Loss for which it seeks indemnification under this _Article VI_
shall be required to mitigate the Loss as and to the extent required under
applicable Law.

 

6.06 _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party has a claim against an
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such a claim with
reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by an Indemnified
Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

6.07  _No Contribution; Termination of Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy_ _;
No Double Recovery_.

(a) From and after the Closing, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall have or make any claim for indemnification, contribution, set off or
similar rights of recovery from Bank, Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers, directors or employees with respect to any Losses indemnifiable by
Seller hereunder, including on the basis of any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ or any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 5.1 of the Purchase
Agreements, or any breach by, default or non-performance by, Seller under this
Agreement occurring prior to the Closing.

 

(b) (1) With respect to the representations and warranties made by any Party
in _Article_ __ _ III_ or the Purchase Agreements that survive the Closing
Date, the PR Closing Date or the USVI Closing Date, as applicable, until the
first (1st) anniversary thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.01_, the
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party will terminate
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing, the PR Closing or the USVI
Closing, as applicable; (2) with respect to all other representations and
warranties made by any Party in _Article_ __ _ III_ or the Purchase
Agreements, the

 



-87- 

    

 obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party will
terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, plus
sixty (60) days in the case of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 3.02(q)_, Section 5.1(u) of the USVI Purchase Agreement and
Section 5.1(m) of the PR Purchase Agreement; and (3) with respect to any other
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless any Indemnified Party (other than
pursuant to _Sections 6.02(a)(4)_ , _6.02(c)_ (including the matters set forth
on Section 6.02(c) of the Bank Disclosure Schedules), _6.03(a)(2)_ and
_6.03(a)(4)_ , which shall survive until the relevant statute of limitations
plus sixty (60) days), such obligation will terminate on the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the PR Closing Date or the USVI Closing
Date, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (1),
(2) and (3), such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless will not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party
shall have, before the expiration, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of,
_Section_ __ _ 4.12(c)(4)_ or this _Article_ __ _ VI_.

(c) This _Article_ __ _ VI_ (i) with respect to this Agreement will not be
effective until after the Closing, (ii) with respect to the PR Purchase
Agreement will not become effective until after the PR Closing and (iii) with
respect to the USVI Purchase Agreement will not become effective until
after the USVI Closing.

(d) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Seller hereby acknowledge and
agree that, except in the case of fraud, their respective sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages with respect to any and all claims against any
other Party and any indemnification for breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreements, or in connection with this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in this
_Article_ __ _ VI_ and shall be in lieu of any rights the Parties may
have under Law with respect to monetary damages.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall not be
affected by any knowledge acquired, at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no Indemnifying Party shall be liable in respect of any claim under
_Sections 6.02(a)(1)_ , _6.02(a)(2)_ , _6.02(a)(3)_ , _6.03(a)(1)_ or
_6.03(a)(3)_ , as applicable, to the extent the facts, matters or
circumstances giving rise to such claim (i) were known by the Indemnified
Party prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Purchase
Agreements or (ii) became known by the Indemnified Party after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreements but prior to
Closing, the PR Closing or the USVI Closing, as applicable, if (x) such
facts, matters or circumstances would have (1) in the case of Seller as the
Indemnified Party caused any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.02(a)_ or _5.02(b)_ , Section 8.2(a) of the PR Purchase Agreement (if
applicable) or Section 9.2(a) of the USVI Purchase Agreement (if applicable)
not to be satisfied or (2) in the case of Purchaser as the Indemnified Party
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section _ 5.03(a)_ or _5.03(b)_ ,
8.3(a) of the PR Purchase Agreement (if applicable) or Section 9.3(a) of the
USVI Purchase Agreement (if applicable) not

 



-88- 

    

 to be satisfied, (y) the Indemnified Party consummated the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the applicable Purchase Agreement, as
applicable, and (z) the Indemnifying Party was not aware of such facts,
matters or circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, the PR Closing or
the USVI Closing, as applicable.

 

(f) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all amounts paid by Seller or
Purchaser pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall be treated for all Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Consideration.

(g) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to receive indemnification
from the other in respect of all or any portion of any Loss more than once
(notwithstanding that such Loss may result from breaches of multiple
provisions of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements).

 

ARTICLE VII

 

Termination

7.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing as follows:

(a) by written agreement of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) by either Purchaser or Seller, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if any condition to such terminating Partys
obligations hereunder has not been satisfied or waived and the Closing shall
not have occurred on or prior to March 26, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ ");
_provided_ that the terminating Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.01(b)_ is not then in material breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations under this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements;
_provided_ , _further_ that if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to
such date and all the conditions to Closing, other than one or more of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.02(d)_ and
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_, shall have been satisfied or shall be capable
of being satisfied at such time and the extending Party is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations set forth herein or in the Purchase Agreements, the Outside Date
may be extended on one occasion by Seller or Purchaser by written notice to
the other Party to June 26, 2020 and such date, if and as so extended, shall
be the Outside Date;

 

(c) by Purchaser (provided Purchaser is not then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth herein or
in the Purchase Agreements), if Seller has breached any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement or any such representation or warranty
becomes untrue or inaccurate, or breached or failed to perform any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach, failure to be true,
inaccuracy or failure to perform (in the case of any representation or
warranty, taken together with all breaches, failures to be true or 

 



-89- 

    

 inaccuracies with respect to any representation or warranty of Seller set
forth in the Purchase Agreements) would give rise to a failure of any
condition set forth in  _Sections_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ or _5.03(b)_ and is not
capable of being cured within the earlier of (1) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Purchaser to Seller and (2) the Outside
Date (as such date may be extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement); or

(d) by Seller (provided Seller is not then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth herein or in

warranty set forth in this Agreement or any such representation or warranty

or agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach, failure to be true,
inaccuracy or failure to perform (in the case of any representation or
warranty, taken together with all breaches, failures to be true or
inaccuracies with respect to any representation or warranty of Purchaser set
forth in the Purchase Agreements) would give rise to a failure of any
condition set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ or  _5.02(b)_ and is not
capable of being cured within the earlier of (1) thirty (30) days after
written notice is given by Seller to Purchaser and (2) the Outside Date (as
such date may be extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement).

7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) below, if this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ VII_, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Purchaser or
Seller shall have any liability to each other or their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, shareholders, partners, agents or employees in
connection with this Agreement, except that (a) the obligations of the Parties
contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.07_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _
4.21(a)_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ and _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and any
relevant definitions shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (b)
termination will not relieve any Party from liability or damages arising
out of its fraud or intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement
occurring prior to termination.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ and, at the time of such termination, (A) the

5.03_ shall have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied) or waived
in writing, then Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
days after the date of such termination, reimburse Seller for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket fees, expenses and costs expended or incurred by
it and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Purchase Agreements or the termination of this Agreement
and the Purchase Agreements, including in respect of counsel and financial
advisors; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse Seller
more than $2,000,000.00 in the aggregate, including any amount reimbursable

and understanding among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
(and supersede any prior agreements, arrangements or understandings among the

8.09 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements were not to be performed as
required by their specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches, and to specific performance of
the terms, of this Agreement or the Purchase Agreements, as applicable, in
addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The Parties agree to not seek,
and agree to waive, any requirement for securing or posting of a bond in

_Section_ __ _ 8.09_.

 

8.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not

Authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefore in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this
Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons, entities or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability, of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other

8.11 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except for any Purchaser Releasee or Seller Releasee,
in each case, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ (and only with respect to
matters expressly contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.18_), nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement upon any Person other than the Parties
and their successors or permitted assigns.

8.12 _Venue for Resolution of Disputes_. Each Party hereto agrees that it
shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of
or related to the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated
thereby, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity, exclusively, in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (or,
if such court does not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the
Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York), and (1)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (2) waives
any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in such courts
and (3) waives any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any Party hereto. Each Party hereto further hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum or that such Party is not subject to
personal jurisdiction in such court.

8.13 _Payments_. All payments made pursuant to this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated, will be made by wire transfer of dollars in immediately
available funds.

8.14 _Purchase Agreement Closings_. If either of the Purchase
Agreement Closings does not occur substantially contemporaneously with the
Closing, then the references in this Agreement to such Purchase Agreement,
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities (as defined in such Purchase
Agreement) and, if the USVI Closing has not occurred, the USVIs in the
definition of "Material Adverse Effect" will be deemed to be deleted. If
either of the Purchase Agreements is terminated in accordance with its terms,
then references in this Agreement to such Purchase Agreement, the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities (as defined in such Purchase Agreement),
the USVIs (if the USVI Purchase Agreement is terminated) and other matters
expressly addressed in such Purchase Agreement will be deemed to be deleted
and read out, except in the case of the Recitals, _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 8.14_. If the USVI Closing does not occur substantially
contemporaneously with the Closing, then the Parties will cooperate with each
other in good faith to negotiate and enter into appropriate arrangements for
Bank (or its successor) to continue to provide services to Seller in
connection with its USVIs operations so that the Branches can continue
to operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 



-94- 

    

8.15 _Cooperation_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall and shall cause Bank to
take the actions specified in Section 8.15 of the Bank Disclosure Schedules.
