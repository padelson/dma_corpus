a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting controls described in the following
sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive
ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that:
(1)&nbsp;transactions are executed only in accordance with management&#146;s authorization; (2)&nbsp;transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; (3)&nbsp;access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with management&#146;s
authorization; (4)&nbsp;the reporting of such assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals; and (5)&nbsp;accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and
proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to the Company&#146;s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)&nbsp;all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls
over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company&#146;s internal
controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies of any material written materials
relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed
under
the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company&#146;s
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in the Company&#146;s periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the
Company (as defined in Rule&nbsp;3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).
