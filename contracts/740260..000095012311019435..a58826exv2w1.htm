Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any claim or notice nor has any knowledge indicating that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is currently not in compliance with the terms of any such Parent Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of any such Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. 

   

 (a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available basis) to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements thereto, from and after January 1, 2009 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (b) Each of Parents consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments). 

  

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with 

   ##### 

  

    

managements authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with managements authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes
and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and
adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal controls, and Parent has made available to the Company
copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. Parent
has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required to
be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parents
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parents periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule
3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act). 

  

 (d) None of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly contemplated by or under this Agreement, including without limitation _Section 6.2_ hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since January 1, 2009 which remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has not been adequately addressed. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received since January 1, 2010 through the date of this Agreement relating to the Parent SEC Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential treatment request by Parent. 

     #####

   ##### 

  

    

federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial
or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request. Subject to the terms of the Company Leases,
Parent, at its own expense, shall have the right to such reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice in order to
prepare or cause to be prepared surveys, inspections, engineering studies,
environmental assessments and other tests, examination or studies with
respect to the Company Property that Parent deems to be reasonably necessary,
so long as such access does not unduly interfere with the Companys ordinary
conduct of business; provided, that Parent indemnify the Company for any
losses, costs or damages caused by such access. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall be required by this
_Section 6.4_ to provide the other party or the Representatives of such
other party with access to or to disclose information (x) that is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this
Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access
or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or
fiduciary duty ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the withholding party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or fiduciary
duty) or (z) that is subject to any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). (b) Each of the Company and
Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to hold,
any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to
this  _Section 6.4_, in confidence to the extent required by and in

Confidentiality Agreements. (c) Each of the Company and Parent agree to give
prompt written notice to the other upon becoming aware of the occurrence
or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, which (i)
could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or (ii) if unremedied by the Effective Time, would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, or
covenants contained herein, and to use its reasonable best efforts to prevent
or promptly to remedy the same; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations and warranties of any party or
relieve any party of any breach of any such representation or warranty or
affect the remedies available to the party receiving notice hereunder.

   ##### 

  

    

discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any non-
public information in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way
with, or knowingly facilitate in any way any effort by, any Third Party in
connection with, any Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry, (iii) approve
or recommend a Company Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_) providing for
or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5(b)_, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_) (i) furnish non-public information to such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) making a Company Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to such Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be provided to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or simultaneously with providing it to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Partys Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that in each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), such Company Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of _Section 6.5_. 

  

 (c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Third Party, or any Inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Third Party making the Company Acquisition Proposal or Inquiry and the material terms and conditions of any Inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any person in accordance with this _Section 6.5(c)_ and keep the other party informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend (or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or any Schedule 14D-9, as applicable, (iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days of the request of Parent and reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) business days (any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 6.5(d)_, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare advisable or recommend), or cause or permit the Company to enter into, any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.5_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board shall be permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board (x) has received a Company Acquisition Proposal that, in the good faith determination of the Company Board, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_ , and (y) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section 6.5(d)_ unless (i) the Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company intends to take such action and describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (it being understood that such material terms shall include the identity of the Third Party), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parents and Merger Subs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the three (3) Business Day period above shall then be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day period. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by 

   ##### 

  

    

Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Company Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation to
the Companys stockholders in favor of the Merger shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change. 

  

 (g) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries (other than any Company Subsidiary in which the Company directly or indirectly owns 25% or less of the outstanding equity interests) and its and their officers and directors, managers or equivalent, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any other Representatives of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to (i) immediately cease any existing discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality or "standstill" provisions or provisions of similar effect to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or of which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a beneficiary. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished confidential information regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal within the six (6) months prior to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or destroy such information (to the extent that the Company is entitled to have such information returned or destroyed).

 Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

   

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, partners, members, trustees or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or each of the Company Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by: (x) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or the articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (y) any indemnification agreement of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed in the Company Disclosure Letter, or (z) applicable Law, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.9(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the 

   ##### 

  

    

contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall
not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent
and (ii) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the
extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and
non-appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by
applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent
or the Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses theretofore advanced
pursuant hereto. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies and with policy limits no less than the limits on the Companys existing policies as long as the annual premium does not exceed 110% of the annual premium under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company (which may be provided under Parents DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

  

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys 

   ##### 

  

    

fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.9_. 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.9_ shall be in addition to any rights such person or any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnitee or any employee with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries listed in _Section 4.12(a)(iv)_ the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.9_. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   

 (a) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide to employees and former employees of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) a base salary or wage rate at least equal to the Company Employees base salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (other than any incentive compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee benefits (other than any incentive compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries under the Parent Benefit Plans. 

  

 (b) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, to each Company Employee who is a participant in a Company Severance Pay Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with the Surviving Entity, Company Subsidiaries and its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated in a severance-qualifying manner during the one (1)-year period following the Effective Time, severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the severance benefits, if any, that would have been provided to 

   ##### 

  

    

such Company Employee pursuant to the terms of a Company Severance Pay Plan
upon such an involuntary severance-qualifying termination of employment
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that no such severance
benefits shall be provided to any Company Employee who is a party to a
Company Employment Agreement that otherwise provides for severance benefits. 

  

 (c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting, benefit accrual and determination of level of benefits under the compensation and benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Parent Subsidiaries, the Company Subsidiaries, the Surviving Entity and any of its subsidiaries or any respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing, and in which such Company Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), including for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans (but excluding any New Plan that is established after the Closing that does not recognize service prior to its adoption), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan, except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before such replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents except to the extent such pre-existing conditions and actively-at-work requirements would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan listed in _Section 6.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control." 

  

 (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Entity to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement, and no current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of this _Section 6.10_, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement
for any purpose.

Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and delivering the officers certificates referred to therein.

The per share dividend amount payable by Parent shall be an amount equal to (i) Parents most recent quarterly dividend, multiplied by the number of days elapsed since the last dividend record date through and including the day prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, and divided by the actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is declared, plus (ii) the Additional Dividend Amount, if any, divided by the Exchange Ratio.

 (d) _Absence of Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have been any event, change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

   ##### 

  

    

hereby have been voted upon, provided that the right to terminate this

or 

  

 (c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on or before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by Parent within twenty (20) days of receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure; provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if the Company is then in breach of any of its respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in either  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied; or 

  

 (d) by Parent, if: 

   

 (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (x) would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a failure of a condition set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (y) cannot be cured on or before the Outside Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within twenty (20) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent or Merger Sub are then in breach of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, or 

   

 (ii) (x) the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) the Company shall have materially or willfully breached any of its obligations under _Section 6.3_ and _Section 6.5_ or (z) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 6.5_), provided that the right to terminate under Section 8.1(d)(ii)(x) and (y) shall not be available after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are abandoned pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null 

    ##### 

  

 

and void and of no further force or effect whatsoever without liability on the
part of any party hereto (or any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent
Subsidiaries or any of the Companys or Parents respective Representatives),
and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary (a) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any
liability or damages resulting from or arising out of any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement; and (b) the Confidentiality Agreements,
this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.6_, _Article IX_ and the
definitions of all defined terms appearing in such sections shall survive any

submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall
be withdrawn from the agency or other person to which they were made. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_. __ 

   

 (a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated: 

   

 (i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ and (A) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), the Parent Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained and the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained prior to such termination, and (B) the Company (x) receives or has received a Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, which proposal has been publicly announced and (y) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with respect to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent a fee equal to $175,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") plus, if not previously paid pursuant to the proviso below, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, not later than the consummation of such transaction arising from such Company Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)"; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Expense Amount (by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent) within two (2) Business Days of such termination rather than when the Termination Fee becomes payable to Parent (if ever); or 

   

 (ii) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and (A) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained and the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained prior to such termination, and (B) Parent (x) 

   ##### 

  

    

receives or has received a _bona fide_ Parent Acquisition Proposal, which
proposal has been publicly announced and (y) within twelve (12) months of the
termination of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or
executes a definitive agreement which is later consummated with respect to, a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Company the Termination Fee plus, if not previously paid pursuant to the
proviso below, the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by the Company, not later than the consummation of such
transaction arising from such Parent Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that the Agreement is terminated by either the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_, Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to the Company the Expense Amount (by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Company) within two (2) Business Days of such
termination rather than when the Termination Fee becomes payable to the
Company (if ever); or 

   

 (iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee together with the Expense Amount, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days of such termination. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that: 

   

 (i) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party entitled to payment; and 

   

 (ii) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

  

 (c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this  _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying 

   ##### 

  

    

party shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of ten percent
(10%) for the period from the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as
is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 (d) (i) If one party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Fee Payor_ ") is required to pay another party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Fee Payee_ ") a Termination Payment, such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Fee Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event that the Termination Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Fee Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to the Termination Fee Payee in any tax year of the Termination Fee Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment of the Termination Fee Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination Fee Payee without causing the Termination Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the Termination Fee Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Termination Fee Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination Fee Payees counsel indicating that the Termination Fee Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the Termination Fee Payees outside counsel as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment less the amount payable under clause (A) above. 

   

 (ii) To secure the Termination Fee Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Termination Fee Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Fee Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(d)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Termination Fee Payor, the Termination Fee Payee and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Fee Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Fee Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination Fee Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Termination Fee Payees independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Termination Fee Payee without causing the Termination Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Termination Fee Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Termination Fee Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Fee Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Fee Payee of the Termination Payment 

   ##### 

  

    

would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or (B)
the Termination Fee Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by the Termination Fee Payee of the Termination
Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in
which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination
Payment to the Termination Fee Payee. The Termination Fee Payor agrees to
amend this _Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the Termination Fee
Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination Payment that
may be distributed to the Termination Fee Payee hereunder without causing the
Termination Fee Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Termination Fee Payees chances of
securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (iii)
assist the Termination Fee Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion
from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount
of the Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable
year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year,
subject to the foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_, provided that
the obligation of the Termination Fee Payor to pay the unpaid portion of the
Termination Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date
which is four years from the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement: " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the same meaning as "Company Acquisition Proposal with the word "Parent" replacing the words "the Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries" _mutatis mutandis_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal, (i) the reference to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be reference to "fifty percent (50%)" and (ii) transactions in which Parent is the acquiring party shall not be included. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation 

  ##### 

  

    

or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the proviso of
_Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder. 

   

 Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company and Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and filing of the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Appendix or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Appendix or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means

such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws.
References to a person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

   

 Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (except to the Surviving Entity). 

   

 Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_.

Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with  _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

   

 Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Merger 

    ##### 

  

 

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
