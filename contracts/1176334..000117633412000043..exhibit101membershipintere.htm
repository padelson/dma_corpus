other Party or their Affiliates. The Seller will retain, until the expiration

Solely for the purpose of indemnification under this Section 5.1, the
representations and warranties of the Seller and the Guarantor in this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality
or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. Subject to the other provisions of this
Article V, from and after the Closing Date, the Seller and the Guarantor,
jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer and the Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, managers, directors,
officers, members, shareholders, employees and agents (the "Buyer
Indemnitees") from and against, and shall reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for,
any and all Losses, including without limitation any Losses arising out of the
strict liability of any Person, paid, imposed on or incurred by the Buyer
Indemnitees, directly or indirectly, resulting from, caused by, arising out
of, or in any way relating to and with respect to any of, or any allegation of
the following:

(n) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty on the part
of the Seller or the Guarantor under this Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedule) or any Related Agreement furnished or to be furnished to the Buyer
or the Parent by the Seller or the Guarantor;

(o) any non-fulfillment of any indemnity, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Seller or the Guarantor under this Agreement or any Related Agreement; and

(p) the Pre-Closing Liabilities.

It shall not be necessary for Losses to be suffered as a result of or in
connection with actions taken, made or threatened by any claimant or
Governmental or Regulatory Authority for such Losses to be indemnifiable under
this Article V.

5.2 Indemnification by the Buyer and the Parent.

Solely for the purpose of indemnification under this Section 5.2, the
representations and warranties of the Buyer and the Parent in this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. Subject to the other provisions of this
Article V, from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Parent, jointly
and severally, hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Guarantor and the Seller and their respective Subsidiaries, managers,
directors, officers, members, shareholders, employees and agents (the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against, and shall reimburse the Seller Indemnitees
for, any and all Losses, including without limitation any Losses arising out
of the strict liability of any Person, paid, imposed on or incurred by the
Seller Indemnitees, directly or indirectly, resulting from, caused by, arising
out of, or in any way relating to and with respect to any of, or any
allegation of the following:

(f) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty on the part

or the Guarantor by the Buyer or the Parent;

(g) any non-fulfillment of any indemnity, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Parent or the Buyer under this Agreement or any Related Agreements; and

(h) the Post-Closing Liabilities.

5.3 Procedures for Indemnification.

(d) If there occurs an event that a Party asserts is an indemnifiable event
pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnitee") shall promptly provide notice (the "Notice of Claim") to the
other Party or Parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party"). Providing the Notice of Claim shall be a condition precedent to any
Liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, and the failure to provide
prompt notice as provided herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder but only if and to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case any such
action shall be brought against any Indemnitee and it shall provide a Notice
of Claim to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnitee and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party
to such Indemnitee of such election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee, in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that
if the Indemnitee reasonably believes that counsel for the Indemnifying Party
cannot represent both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party because such
representation would be reasonably likely to result in a conflict of interest,
then the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, such action by all appropriate proceedings.
The Indemnitee agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the defense against any such asserted liability. In any event,
the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the
defense of such asserted liability. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of
any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the written consent of each
Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the release of the
Indemnitee from all Liability in respect to such claim or litigation or that
does not solely require the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying
Person. The Indemnifying Party agrees to afford the Indemnitee and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, asserting any
Claim against the Indemnitee or conferences with representatives of or counsel
for such Persons. In no event shall the Indemnifying Party, without the
written consent of the Indemnitee, settle any Claim on terms that provide for
(i) a criminal sanction against the Indemnitee or (ii) injunctive relief
affecting the Indemnitee.

(e) Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 20
calendar days (or such shorter period as may be appropriate under the
circumstances) to contest its indemnification obligation with respect to such
claim, or the amount thereof, by written notice to the Indemnitee (the
"Contest Notice"); provided, however, that if, at the time a Notice of Claim
is submitted to the Indemnifying Party the amount of the Loss in respect
thereof has not yet been determined, such 20 day period in respect of, but
only in respect of the amount of the Loss, shall not commence until a further
written notice (the "Notice of Liability") has been sent or delivered by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party setting forth the amount of the Loss
incurred by the Indemnitee that was the subject of the earlier Notice of
Claim. Such Contest Notice shall specify the reasons or bases for the
objection of the Indemnifying Party to the claim, and if the objection relates
to the amount of the Loss asserted, the amount, if any, that the Indemnifying
Party believes is due the Indemnitee, and any undisputed amount shall be
promptly paid over to the Indemnitee. If no such Contest Notice is given
within such 20 day period, the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to pay the
Indemnitee the amount of the Loss set forth in the Notice of Claim, or
subsequent Notice of Liability, shall be deemed established and accepted by
the Indemnifying Party.

(f) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Claim or,
having assumed the defense and settlement of such Claim, fails reasonably to
contest such Claim in good faith, the Indemnitee, without waiving its right to
indemnification, may assume, at the cost of the Indemnifying Party, the
defense and settlement of such Claim; provided, however, that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to join in the defense and settlement of
such Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense, (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in the defense and settlement of
such Claim in any manner reasonably requested by the Indemnitee and (iii) the
Indemnitee shall not settle such Claim without soliciting the views of the
Indemnifying Party and giving them due consideration.

(g) The Indemnifying Party shall make any payment required to be made under
this Article in cash and on demand. Any payments required to be paid by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article that are not paid within five business
days of the date on which such obligation becomes final shall thereafter be
deemed delinquent, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnitee,
immediately upon demand, interest at the rate of 10% per annum, not to exceed
the maximum nonusurious rate allowed by applicable Law, from the date such
payment becomes delinquent to the date of payment of such delinquent sums,
which interest shall be considered to be Losses of the Indemnitee.

5.4 Survival.

(a) The liability of the Seller and the Guarantor for their indemnification
obligations arising under Section 5.1 shall be limited to claims for
indemnification for which a Buyer Indemnitee delivers written notice to the
Seller or the Guarantor on or before the 12 month anniversary of the Closing
Date; provided, however, that any indemnification obligation relating to (i)
Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, and 6.13 and any claim with respect to Pre-Closing
Liabilities shall be limited to the applicable statute of limitation, (ii)
Section 2.14 shall be limited to claims for which a Buyer Indemnitee delivers
written notice to the Seller or the Guarantor on or before the 30 month
anniversary date of the Closing Date, and (iii) the non-fulfillment of any
covenant or agreement shall be limited to claims for which a Buyer Indemnitee
delivers written notice to the Seller or the Guarantor on or before the date
at which performance of the covenant is no longer required.

(b) The liability of the Buyer and the Parent for their indemnification
obligations arising under Section 5.2 shall be limited to claims for which a
Seller Indemnitee delivers written notice to the Buyer or the Parent on or
before the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
any indemnification obligation relating to (i) Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 6.13 and
any claim with respect to Post-Closing Liabilities shall be limited to the
applicable statute of limitation, and (ii) the non-fulfillment of any covenant
or agreement shall be limited to claims for which a Seller Indemnitee delivers
written notice to the Buyer or the Parent on or before the date at which
performance of the covenant is no longer required.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from an Indemnified Party to an
Indemnifying Party prior to the appropriate date required for notice set forth
in such Sections shall not thereafter be barred and such claims shall survive
until finally resolved.

(d) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive for
the applicable period required for their performance.

5.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

No Indemnifying Party hereto shall have any liability with respect to, or
obligation to indemnify for, Losses under Article V hereof unless the
aggregate amount of Losses for which such Indemnifying Party would, but for
the provisions of this Section 5.5, be liable exceeds, on an aggregate basis,
One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), it being agreed that
in such event the Indemnifying Party's obligations under Article V hereof will
take such threshold into account as a deductible and the Indemnitee will be
entitled to receive only the amount of such Losses in excess of such
threshold; provided, however, that such threshold shall not apply to Losses
related to any of the matters described in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 2.14, 3.2,
3.3, 5.1(b), 5.2(b) and 6.13 hereof or to Pre-Closing Liabilities and Post-
Closing Liabilities. The maximum indemnification liability of the Seller and
the Guarantor, on the one hand, and of the Parent and the Buyer, on the other
hand, shall not exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000); provided, however,
that such limitation shall not apply to any breaches asserted with respect to
Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.8, 3.2 or 3.3, in which case the maximum indemnification
liability of the Seller and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Parent and
the Buyer, on the other hand, shall not exceed the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any
Party from liability for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement of any
or willful misrepresentation herein.

5.6 Inconsistent Provisions.

The provisions of this Article shall govern and control over any inconsistent
provisions of this Agreement or the Related Agreements.

5.7 Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge.

The right to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article
will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation set
forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement.

5.8 SCOPE AND EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY.

THE INDEMNITIES HEREIN ARE INDEPENDENT OF, AND WILL NOT BE LIMITED BY, EACH
OTHER OR THE COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.

THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE ARE INTENDED TO BE
ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE
THEREOF, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE SOLE, JOINT,
CONCURRENT, COMPARATIVE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY
OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. WHILE THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE
INDEMNITIES SET FORTH HEREIN MAY RESULT IN THE INDEMNIFICATION OF A PARTY FOR
ITS SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, IN NO EVENT WILL THESE INDEMNITIES REQUIRE ONE PARTY TO
INDEMNIFY, DEFEND OR HOLD THE OTHER PARTY HARMLESS FOR SUCH OTHER PARTY'S
GROSS NEGLIGENCE, ITS WANTON AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR FRAUD.
