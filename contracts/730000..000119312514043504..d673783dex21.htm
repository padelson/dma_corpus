Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the

Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or

adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities

Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by holders of Shares that have made written demand upon the
Company for the purchase of such Shares and payment to the holders in cash of
the "fair market value" of such Shares (the " _Demand Notice_ ") and
perfected their rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this 
_Section 2.7_. Such holders of Shares shall be entitled to only such rights
as are granted by Chapter 13 of the CGCL, except that all such holders that
have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost
their rights under Chapter 13 of the CGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.8_.

received by the Company, withdrawals thereof, and any other instruments served

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall

holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, an amount
of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Merger
Consideration and (y) the aggregate number of Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Shares then owned by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " _Certificates_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates
pursuant to this _Section 2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 



18 (d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the
stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form
for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of Merger Consideration to a Person

Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal or state, local or
non-U.S. Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article III_, as set forth in
the section of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") that
specifically relates to such Section or in another section of the Company
Disclosure Letter to the extent it is readily apparent from the text of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Section, the Annual
Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2013
(the " _Company Form 10-K_ ") and the SEC Reports filed after the
Company Form 10-K and prior to February 1, 2014 (other than disclosures in
the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" sections of such reports,
other disclosures that are similarly non-specific or are predictive
or forward-looking in nature and excluding any exhibits incorporated by
reference in such reports), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under California Law. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its respective organization (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States). Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
respective business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or
operate its respective properties and assets. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of

 



20  its properties owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies
of (a) the certificates of incorporation and bylaws or other constituent
documents, as amended to date, of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) the
minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of
all meetings of the shareholders, the Company Board and each committee of the
Company Board since January 1, 2009. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of its articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other applicable constituent documents.

3.2 _Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of the name, jurisdiction of organization and function (i.e.,
sales, manufacturing, administration, etc.) of each Subsidiary of the Company.
Except for the Companys Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any
Person.

of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting
interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted.

 

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any

capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other
similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of
the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the
capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to
collectively as " _Subsidiary Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or

notice of any breach of or default under, any Lease or Third Party Lease, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default thereunder by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries would be reasonably required to expend
more than $25,000 in causing any Real Property to comply with the surrender

company of any defects or inadequacies in any Real Property or any part
thereof which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect

Registered IP invalid or unenforceable, or would materially affect any
pending application for any Company Registered IP. The Company has not
misrepresented, or knowingly failed to disclose, any facts or circumstances in
any application or proceedings for any Company Registered IP that
would constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect to such
application or that would otherwise affect the enforceability of any Company
Registered IP.

 

(d) With respect to each item of Company Registered IP: (i) all necessary
registration, maintenance and renewal fees have been paid, and all necessary

past, present and future damages for infringement or misappropriation of such
Intellectual Property Rights) and (ii) the other parties thereto have not
retained and do not have any rights or licenses with respect to the Company
Intellectual Property Rights. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder do not conflict with or violate such third party agreements and no
basis exists for such third party to challenge or object to this Agreement.
In each case in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have acquired
ownership of any Company Registered IP, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
has recorded each such acquisition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
the U.S. Copyright Office, or their respective equivalents in the applicable
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with applicable Laws.

 

(f) _Section 3.22(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contain a complete and

Company has entered into in the ordinary course of business (such Contacts,
the " _Company IP Agreements_ "). The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent complete and correct copies of each such Company IP Agreement. Each
Company IP Agreement is valid and binding on the Company (and/or each such
Subsidiary of the Company party thereto) and is in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries party thereto, nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in breach of, or default

are no pending disputes regarding the scope of such Company IP Agreements,
performance under the Company IP Agreements, or with respect to payments made

be conducted. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have the right to use all software development tools, library functions, or
compilers that the Company or its Subsidiaries (i) use to create,
modify, compile, or support the Company Products that are Software or (ii)
use to provide any Company Products that are services. Neither the operation
of the business of the Company nor the use, provision, support, reproduction,
making, distribution, marketing, sale, license or display of the Company
Products by Company or its Subsidiaries, did, or do, or will: (A) infringe or
misappropriate the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person; (B) violate the
rights of any Person (including rights to privacy or publicity); or (C)
constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any
jurisdiction (nor does Company have knowledge of any basis therefore).

 

(h) The Company and its Subsidiaries own all right, title and interest in, or

free and clear of all Liens other than (i) obligations arising under the terms

Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) Permitted Liens. All Company Intellectual
Property Rights will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by Parent
without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have, and following the Effective Time,
the Parent will have the exclusive right to bring actions against any person
that is infringing any Company Intellectual Property Rights and to retain for
themselves any damages recovered in any such action. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries have transferred ownership of, let lapse or enter
into the public domain or granted any exclusive license of or exclusive right
to use, or authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint
ownership of any Company Intellectual Property Rights to any other Person. No
Person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries has ownership rights or
exclusive license rights to any improvement or derivative works made by or for
Company or one of its Subsidiaries in any Company IP or Company Intellectual

reasonable steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the Trade
Secrets that comprise any part of the Company IP, and to the knowledge of the
Company, there is no unauthorized use, disclosure or misappropriation of any
such Trade Secrets by any Person. To the knowledge of the Company, all use
and disclosure of Trade Secrets owned by another Person by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement
with such Person or such use and disclosure by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries was otherwise lawful. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring employees and certain consultants
and contractors to execute a confidentiality and assignment

Parent which (i) assigns to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries all right,
title and interest (including the sole right to enforce) in any Intellectual
Property Rights arising therefrom and (ii) provides commercially reasonable
protection for Trade Secrets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All current

Subsidiary that have created any Company IP have executed such agreements,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no party to any such agreement is in
material breach thereof.

 

(j) To the knowledge of the Company, no Person (or any of such Persons
products or services or other operation of such Persons business) is
infringing upon or otherwise violating any Company Intellectual Property
Rights, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have asserted or
threatened any claim against any Person alleging the same.

 

(k) There is and has not been in the prior six (6) years any Legal Proceeding
made, conducted or brought by a third party that has been served upon, filed
or threatened in writing, or, to the knowledge of the Company, otherwise
threatened, with respect to (i) any alleged infringement or other violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
current products or services or other operation of the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries business of the Intellectual Property Rights of such third
party or (ii) any challenge to the validity or enforceability of, or
contesting the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights with respect to,
any of the Company IP or Company Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order of any Governmental Entity that
restricts or impairs the use, transfer or licensing of any Company IP or
Company Intellectual Property Rights or other Intellectual Property Rights.

(l) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not result in (i)

licenses to any Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) any right of termination
or cancellation under any Company IP Agreement, (iii) any payment of fees,
penalties, royalties or expenses under any Company IP Agreement that would not
have been payable absent this

or by, the Company or its Subsidiaries, (v) the imposition of any Lien on any
Owned Company IP, or (vi) after the Merger, (A) Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates being required to grant any third party any rights
or licenses to any of Parents or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
Intellectual Property Rights, (B) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates being bound by, or subject to, any non-competition, non-
solicitation, exclusivity or other material restriction on the operation or

material amounts, offer any incremental discounts or being bound by any "most
favored pricing" terms to any third party except to the extent, in each case
with respect to clause (A), (B) or (C), caused by a contract to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a party.

 

(m) Except as set forth in _Section 3.22(m)_ of the Company Disclosure

Confidential Technology for the Company Products has been published or
disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to its employees
or advisers or pursuant to non-disclosure agreements, or, to the knowledge of
the Company, by any other person except as authorized by the Company under a
non-disclosure agreement. No condition has occurred that would be sufficient
to entitle the beneficiary under any technology escrow arrangement under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have deposited any material
Confidential Technology

 



45  for any Company Product to require release of such Confidential Technology.
The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) will not constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary

and its Subsidiaries have the full power and authority to transfer any and all
rights in any personal information in the Companys and its Subsidiaries
possession or control to Parent, there are no provisions in any applicable
privacy policy that would prevent or restrict such transfer and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no applicable Laws that would prevent or
restrict such transfer. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any obligation that would prevent Parent from using the personal
information in a manner consistent with any law or industry standard
regarding the collection, retention, use, or disclosure of such information.

(q) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no design, manufacturing, or
other defects or errors in the Company Products or Company IP, that have not

written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this

or Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement as permitted by _Section
6.1(b)_) contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal

such Persons representatives), on the other hand. In addition to the
foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with at least seventy-two (72)
hours (or such shorter period as provided to the members of the Company Board)

nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (a "
_Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder
Approval, if and only if:

 

(i) (A) the Company Board has received a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of  _Section 6.1_ that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall have breached or violated (or be deemed, pursuant to the
terms hereof, to have breached or violated) the provisions of  _Section 6.1_
in any material respect, (C) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith
any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (E) below),
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Company Board to
effect a Company Board

 



58  Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of
its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company under California Law, (D)
prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days notice thereof
(which notice shall include the most current version of such definitive
agreement and, to the extent not included therein, the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Superior Proposal) and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and
its outside legal counsel during such five (5) Business Day period, all with
the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good
faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to
obviate the need for the Company Board to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change, and (E) Parent shall not have made, within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys written notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, a counter-offer or
proposal that the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and
its outside legal counsel, is at least as favorable to shareholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change to the
financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (D) above and a new
five (5) Business Day period pursuant to this clause (D)); or

(ii) (A) an "Intervening Event" as defined below shall have occurred and be
continuing, (B) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering in good faith
any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent pursuant to clause (D) below),
that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the Company
under California Law, (C) prior to effecting such Company
Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at
least five (5) Business Days notice thereof (which notice shall include a
written explanation of the Company Boards basis and rationale for proposing
to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to
meet with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel during such five (5)
Business Day period, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and
the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for the Company Board
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, and (D) Parent shall not have
made, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Companys written
notice of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, a
counter-offer or proposal that the Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
standing and its outside legal counsel, would obviate the need for the Company
Board to effect such Company Board Recommendation Change. For these purposes,
an "Intervening Event" means a material fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances occurring or existing after the date of this Agreement
with respect to the business, operations, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and not relating in any
way to (x) an Acquisition Proposal or (y) any fluctuation in the market price
or trading volume of the Shares, in and of itself) that was not known to the
Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 



59 (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is
likely required in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to shareholders
of the Company under California Law; _provided_ that any statement(s) made by
the Company Board pursuant to this sentence shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the provisions of _Article VIII_ (it
being acknowledged and agreed that any such disclosure, other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act or any other disclosure made pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_
that is limited to describing the existence and terms of any Acquisition
Proposal, shall be deemed to be in a Company Board Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation in such communication).

(d) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions on
"control share acquisitions" contained in any Takeover Law or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply. To the extent permitted thereunder, the
Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate any waiver or
other exemption that may have been heretofore granted to any such Person or
any Acquisition Proposal under any such provision.

 

6.3 _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall establish a record
date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
shareholders of the Company (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in no event
later than 30 days after the commencement of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Companys shareholders) for the purpose of voting upon the
adoption of this Agreement in accordance with California Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) if there are insufficient shares of the Company Common
Stock necessary to conduct business at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company may extend the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent
(and only to the extent) necessary in order to conduct business at the
Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) the Company may delay the Company
Shareholders Meeting to the extent (and only to the extent) the Company
reasonably determines that such delay is required by applicable Law to comply
with comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and (iii)
with the prior written consent of Parent or if Parent requests an extension,
the Company shall delay the Company Shareholders Meeting for a period not to
exceed ten (10) Business Days. The Company shall solicit from shareholders of
the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance
with California Law, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the
Requisite Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholders Meeting. Unless
this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company
shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with California Law, whether or not the Company
Board

 



60  at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this Agreement
is no longer advisable or recommends that shareholders of the Company reject
it. Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, the Companys obligation to establish a record date for, call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant
to this _Section 6.3_ shall not be limited to, or otherwise affected by, the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal.

shall prepare and no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the

Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement for use in connection with
the solicitation of proxies from shareholders of the Company in connection
with the Merger and the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company and
Parent, as the case may be, shall furnish all information concerning the
Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to all applicable Laws, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company shall file with the SEC the definitive Proxy
Statement, and shall cause the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to
the shareholders of the Company, on or prior to the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately following the later of (i) receipt and resolution of SEC comments
thereon, or (ii) the expiration of the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule
14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, including in such
filings, amendments, supplements and correspondence all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and receiving the approval of Parent (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Company shall advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments
thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff
for additional information in connection therewith, and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its advisors
or representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement
or other filing with the SEC. If the Company or its outside legal counsel
intends to initiate a telephone conference or meet with the SEC and its staff
related to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or the Merger, the Company
shall so inform the Parent and solicit input on the items planned to be
discussed during such telephone conference or meeting. If at any time prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the 

 



61  Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement does not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such
information shall be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form
and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, California Law and the rules of the Nasdaq.

(b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_,
subject to the terms of _Section 6.2(b)_, the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

 

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts to Complete_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), including
using reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in  _Article VII_ hereof to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain all
necessary or appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such
Contracts following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger); (iii) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods,
making all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including
registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of  _Section
6.5(a)_, as soon as may be reasonably practicable following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any foreign
Governmental Entity that may be required by the merger notification or
control Laws and regulations of any applicable foreign jurisdiction or be
deemed desirable by Parent, in each case as Parent may deem necessary and/or
appropriate. Each of Parent 

 



62  and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other
in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that
may be required in order to effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any
additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by the
FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other
jurisdiction and that Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate.
Parent and the Company shall share equally all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with filings made in connection with this _Section 6.5(b)_. Each
party hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the
case may be, of any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger). If
any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
6.5(a)_, in the event that any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger) may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly understood and agreed that: (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be under any obligation to make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements, enter into consent decrees or submit to orders providing for
(A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the imposition of any limitation or regulation on
the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to freely conduct their
business or own such assets, or (C) the holding separate of the shares of
Company Common Stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares
of Company Common Stock, other than, in the case of clauses (A), (B) and (C)
above, for any such sale, divestiture, license, disposition, holding separate,
limitation or regulation that, individually or in the aggregate, would be
immaterial to Parent and/or the Company and their respective Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole (with materiality, for purposes of this provision, being
measured in relation to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole)
(any of the foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

 



63 6.6 _Access_.

 

 __(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of (x)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (y) the
Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, legal
counsel and other representatives full and complete access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the assets (including the Company
IP, design processes and source code), properties (including the right to
conduct an environmental site assessment and audit of the properties), books
and records and personnel of the Company to enable Parent to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of product
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may request; _provided, however_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality

(b) In particular, but without limitation, from and after the date of this
Agreement, Parent and its agents, contractors and representatives shall have
the right and privilege of entering upon all properties leased or occupied by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and of reviewing the Companys books
and records regarding such properties from time to time as needed to make
any inspections, evaluations, surveys or tests which Parent may deem
necessary or appropriate. Parents exercise of its right to inspect such
properties, or Parents election not to inspect any property, shall in no way
be interpreted as a waiver of any of Parents rights or remedies contained in
this Agreement, including, without limitation, Parents right to rely upon the
Companys representations and warranties in this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and the Company agree to mutually cooperate in testing the
Companys IT systems for compatibility and interoperability with Parents IT
systems and in other like matters as reasonably requested by Parent prior to
Closing. In particular, but without limitation, from and after the date of the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, the Company
shall provide to Parent the information described on _Schedule 6.6(c)_ for
purposes of allowing Parent to test its internal business systems ability to
accept and process Company data.

 __(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of (x)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (y) the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if such would give rise to
the ability of the Parent not to close under _Section 7.2(a)_, or of any __

 



64 _ _ failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall

to this _Section 6.7(a)_. __

__(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (y) the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice
or other communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from
any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such third party is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger); _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 6.9_) shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_. __

 

 __(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of (x)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and (y) the
Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if such
would give rise to the ability of the Company not to close under _Section
7.3(a)_, or of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no
such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations
of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section 6.9_) shall apply to any
information provided to the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.7(c)_. __

 

6.8 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the
Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of the Company (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall keep
Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The

 



65  Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation and
shall consider Parents views with respect to such shareholder litigation and
shall not settle any such shareholder litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent.

6.9  _Confidentiality._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 14, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing,
effective as of the execution and delivery hereof, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to be amended so as to permit Parent to take any
action contemplated by this Agreement, including the making of any counter-
offer or proposal contemplated by _Section 6.2(b)_ (which deemed amendment
shall survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
or otherwise).

6.10 _Public Disclosure_. None of the parties shall, without the prior written
consent of other party or parties, as applicable, issue any press release or
otherwise make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), except as may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, in which case such party shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party or parties prior to any
such release or public statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
the Company may make public statements in response to specific questions by
the press, analysts or investors so long as any such statement is consistent
with previous public statements permitted by this _Section 6.10_.

 

6.11 _Company Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (or vests
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
(each, a " _Cancelled Option_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and at the
direction of Parent (which is hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be
cancelled and terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, with respect to each share underlying such Cancelled
Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Cancelled Option (such amount being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The holder of each Cancelled
Option shall receive at the Effective Time from the Company, or as soon as
practicable thereafter (but in no even later than the Companys first full
payroll after the Effective Time) from the Surviving Corporation, an amount
in cash equal to the Option Consideration. If the exercise price per share of
any such Cancelled Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall, by direction of Parent (which is
hereby given pursuant to this Agreement), be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. The payment of Option Consideration to
the holder of a Cancelled Option shall be reduced by any income or employment
tax withholding required under the Code, any applicable Law, or as otherwise
agreed by the parties at the time the Company Option was granted.

 



66 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) shall be assumed by Parent (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each such
Assumed Option shall be subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the vesting schedule applicable thereto, except that
(A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed
Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such unvested Assumed Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (B) the per
share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (x) the exercise price per share at which such Assumed
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest
whole cent). Each Assumed Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify
following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code
and to the extent such Assumed Option qualified as an incentive stock option
prior to the Effective Time, and, further, that the assumption of Assumed
Options pursuant to this _Section 6.11(b)_ shall be effected in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this _Section 6.11(b)_ will
be construed consistent with this intent.

6.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Company shall terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group
of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_Retirement Plan Termination Date_ "), any and all employee retirement plans
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Retirement Plans_ ")
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless Parent provides
written notice to the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time that such Retirement Plans shall not be terminated. The
Company shall provide Parent evidence that the Retirement Plans of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and
approval of Parent. The Company shall also take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such Retirement Plans as Parent may reasonably
request. As soon as practicable following the Retirement Plan Termination
Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who were eligible to
participate in any 401(k) plan maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Retirement Plan Termination Date to
participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall permit each such Continuing
Employee to elect to transfer his or her account balance when distributed from
any terminated 401(k) plan maintained 

 



67  by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any outstanding
participant loans from such 401(k) plans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except to
the extent accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified
status of the Parent 401(k) plan, or as may be prohibited by Parents 401(k)
plan.

(b) From and after the Effective Time through the date which is five (5)
months after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, or such longer
period as may be required by applicable Law, Parent will provide, or will
cause to be provided, to all Continuing Employees who remain employed by
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding benefits derived from awards under any equity incentive plan).
Following the Effective Time and to the extent permitted by applicable Laws,
Parent shall, or shall cause any Subsidiary of Parent, including the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of Continuing Employees in connection with all employee benefit
plans, programs or policies of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which Continuing
Employees first become eligible to participate following the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of level of benefits
(including vacation), including applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation, (but not to the extent that such recognition would result in
duplication of benefits). In these regards, for purposes of determining the
annual deductible, co-pay and out-of pocket expense limitation under its
health plan for Continuing Employees who become eligible during the 2014 plan
year, Parent will credit health plan expenses incurred by Continuing Employees
during 2014 prior to the Effective Time as though they were incurred
immediately after the Effective Time. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that no such Continuing Employee, or any of his
or her eligible dependents, who are participating in the Companys group
health plan shall be excluded from Parents group health plan, or limited in
coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-
existing condition limitation.

(c) The Company shall terminate any and all group severance, separation,
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, effective in each case
no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. The Company
shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent).

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall be terminated. The
rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any offering
period then underway under such Company ESPP shall be determined by treating
the last business day prior to, or if preferable administratively, the last
payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the Effective Time, as the
last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata adjustments
as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise
treating such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes under such Company ESPP. The Company shall
provide

 



68  that no additional offering period or purchase period shall commence under
the Company ESPP after March 31, 2014. Prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to the reasonable review and approval by Parent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 6.12(d)_.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company in any respect, or (y)
constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment to any of
the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to employees or
other persons prior to or following the Closing. Nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate any
such plans or arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

6.13 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations (including the financial obligations) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and
bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or
former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the articles of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Control Time, and during such six (6)
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who were covered by such provisions, except as required by Laws.

 

 __(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective
Time, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in
the aggregate, than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its
option, substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage
and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO
Insurance, _provided further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section 6.13(b)_ Parent and the __

 



69 _ _ Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred percent (200%)
amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company
represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 6.13_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter), provided that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ")
on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the DandO Insurance and for an amount not to exceed three
hundred fifty percent (350%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage
for its last full fiscal year. In the event that the Company does
not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO
Insurance on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the DandO Insurance. In the event that either the Company or Parent shall
purchase such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 6.13(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect. __

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of such surviving corporation shall expressly
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.13_ and have at least substantially equal financial
ability as the Company (immediately prior to such transaction) to satisfy the
obligations of the parties pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ prior to such
merger, consolidation or transfer becoming effective.

 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.13_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the Tail
Policy referred to in _Section 6.13(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 6.13(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each
of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.13(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.13_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.13(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 6.13_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreement of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable
Laws.

 



70 6.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

6.15 _Insurance Policies_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that all of its current and legacy insurance policies are
available for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation, including with respect
any instances where an occurrence and/or claim takes place before the
Effective Time and is not made known until after the Effective Time.

the obligations of such Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any
of such Shareholders Covered Shares.

3\. _Agreement to Vote Covered Shares_.

 

(a) At every meeting of the shareholders of the Company (including the Company
Shareholders Meeting) called, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the

of record on any applicable record date to, vote or provide a consent with
respect to, all of such Shareholders Covered Shares:

4\. _No Solicitation_. Each Shareholder shall, and shall cause any of its
directors, officers or other employees, controlled affiliates, or any
investment banker, attorney or other advisors or representatives retained by
any of them (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Subject to Section 6, each Shareholder shall not, and shall use its reasonable

not authorize or permit any of them to), directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person (other

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), or take any other action
intended to assist or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes or could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and each
Shareholder acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section 4_ by any Representative of such
Shareholder shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4_ by such
Shareholder.

 



-88- 5\. _Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights_. Each Shareholder hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any appraisal rights or dissenters
rights relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the
Merger Agreement that such Shareholder may have with respect to such
Shareholders Covered Shares pursuant to applicable Law.

6\. _Directors and Officers_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (or require any Shareholder
to attempt to) limit or restrict any Shareholder (or any designee of any
Shareholder) who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such
capacity on any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply
to each Shareholder solely in such Shareholders capacity as a holder of
Shares and/or holder of options to purchase Shares); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 6_ is intended to modify or otherwise obviate
any of the rights or obligations under the Merger Agreement.

7\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
each Shareholder shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a proxy in the form
attached hereto as _Annex A_ (the " _Proxy_ "), which shall be irrevocable to
the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, with respect to all of such
Shareholders Covered Shares.

8\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent and/or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shareholders Covered Shares.
All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to
each Shareholders Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each
Shareholder, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have no authority to manage,
direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the
policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to
direct such Shareholder in the voting of any of such Shareholders Covered
Shares, except as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein shall require such Shareholder to

itself and its Covered Shares, as of the date hereof that:

 

(a) _Power; Binding Agreement_. Such Shareholder has full power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Proxy, to perform such
Shareholders obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions

Shareholder of this Agreement, the performance by such Shareholder of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by such Shareholder of the

Shareholder are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by it of
this Agreement or the Proxy, the performance by such Shareholder of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation by such Shareholder of

thereby. None of the execution, delivery or performance by such Shareholder of
this Agreement or the Proxy, the performance by such Shareholder of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation by such Shareholder of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i) violate or conflict
with any provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other

right of termination or acceleration under, any Contract to which such
Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholders properties or assets may
be bound, or (iii) violate or conflict with any Law or Order applicable to
such Shareholder or by which any of such Shareholders properties or assets
are bound, or (iv) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of such Shareholder.

beneficially or otherwise, any Company Securities other than the Company
Securities indicated on the signature page to this Agreement.

engagement letter and other compensation arrangements have been furnished to
Parent) is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisers or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement or this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of such Shareholder.

(f) _Reliance by Parent_. Such Shareholder understands and acknowledges that
Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Shareholders execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

10\. _Certain Restrictions_. Each Shareholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, take any action that would make any representation or warranty of
such Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or enter into any
Contract with any Person in any manner inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement or the Proxy.

 



-90- 11\. _Disclosure_. Subject to reasonable prior notice and approval (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), each Shareholder shall permit
and hereby authorizes Parent and Merger Sub to publish and disclose in all
documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other
disclosure document that Parent and/or Merger Sub determines to be necessary
or desirable in connection with the Merger and any transactions related to
thereto, such Shareholders identity and ownership of Covered Shares and the
nature of such Shareholders commitments, arrangements and understandings
under this Agreement.

12\. _Consents and Waivers_. Each Shareholder hereby gives any consents
or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger
under the terms of any Contracts to which such Shareholder is a party or

Agreement, each Shareholder, in such Shareholders capacity as a Company

fulfill such Shareholders obligations under this Agreement.

 

14\. _Merger Agreement_. Each Shareholder hereby acknowledges receipt of, and

limit the liability of either party hereto, for any breach of this Agreement.

16.  _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

(b) _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



-91- (c) _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an instrument in

waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving compliance with
any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

(d) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed by the Shareholder in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and/or Merger

jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

(e) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

As used herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earliest to
occur of (i) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to Article VIII thereof, (ii) such date and time as the
Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement, or (iii) the making of any waiver, amendment or other
modification of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount of, or changes
the form or type of, consideration to be received by Company shareholders in
the Merger. (i) The attorneys and proxies named above, and each of them, are hereby
authorized and empowered by Shareholder, at any time prior to the Expiration

postponed meeting of shareholders of the Company and in every written consent
in lieu of such meeting: (i) in favor of the approval of the Merger
Agreement, each of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and each other action the taking of which would reasonably be
expected to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) against approval of
any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, consummation of
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and
(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions that
relate to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger

would reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone,
discourage or adversely affect the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

on any other matter except as provided herein. Shareholder may vote the Proxy
Shares on all other matters.
