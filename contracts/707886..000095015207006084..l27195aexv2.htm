between the undersigned shareholder (the &#147;Shareholder&#148;) of PVF Capital Corp., an Ohio corporation
(&#147;PVFC&#148;), and United Community Financial Corp., an Ohio corporation (&#147;UCFC&#148;).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The Shareholder owns or has the power to vote, other than in a fiduciary capacity, &#95;&#95;&#95;
common shares, $0.01 par value per share, of PVFC (together with all other shares of PVFC that the
Shareholder may subsequently acquire or obtain the power to vote, other than in a fiduciary
capacity, the &#147;Shares&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;PVFC has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among UCFC, The Home Savings

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;The parties to the Merger Agreement have made it a condition to their entering into the
Merger Agreement that certain shareholders of PVFC, including the Shareholder, agree to vote their

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;against the approval of any proposal relating to a competing merger or business
combination involving an acquisition of PVFC or the purchase of all or a substantial portion of the
assets of PVFC by any person or entity other than UCFC or an affiliate of UCFC; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;against any other transaction which is inconsistent with the obligations of PVFC under the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U><B>Limitation on Voting Power</B></U>. It is expressly understood and acknowledged that
nothing contained herein is intended to restrict the Shareholder from voting on any matter, or
otherwise from acting, in the Shareholder&#146;s capacity as a director or officer of PVFC with respect
to any matter, including but not limited to, the management or operation of PVFC.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U><B>Termination</B></U>. This Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the date on
which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article&nbsp;Ten of the Merger Agreement,
(b)&nbsp;the date on which the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement is consummated, or (c)&nbsp;the
death of the Shareholder.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U><B>Representations, Warranties, and Additional Covenants of the Shareholder</B></U>. The
Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to UCFC that (a)&nbsp;the Shareholder has the capacity and
all necessary power and authority to vote the Shares, and (b)&nbsp;this Agreement constitutes a legal,
valid, and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors
rights generally. The Shareholder further agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the
Shareholder will not, without the prior written consent of UCFC, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, sell, pledge, or otherwise voluntarily dispose of any of the Shares which
are owned by the Shareholder or take any other voluntary action which would have the effect of
removing the Shareholder&#146;s power to vote the Shares or which would be inconsistent with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder may transfer all or a portion of the
Shares to an immediate family member, but only if the transferee executes an identical Voting
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U><B>Specific Performance</B></U>. The undersigned hereby acknowledges that damages would be an
inadequate remedy for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement and agrees that the
obligations of the Shareholder shall be specifically enforceable and that UCFC shall be entitled to
injunctive or other equitable relief upon such a breach by the Shareholder. The Shareholder further
agrees to waive any bond in connection with obtaining any such injunctive or equitable relief.
This provision is without prejudice to any other rights that UCFC may have against the Shareholder
for any failure to perform his obligations under this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U><B>Governing Law</B></U>. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of Ohio without regard to any of its conflict of laws principles.

meanings attributed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.
