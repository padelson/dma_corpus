THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section 365.1 of Title 6 of
the Louisiana Revised Statutes and 12 U.S.C. §§ 1467a(s) and 1828(c)(2)(B), at
the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Bank shall be merged with and
into Purchaser Bank (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate
existence of the Bank shall cease, and Purchaser Bank shall continue to exist
as a state-chartered bank under the laws of Louisiana (Purchaser Bank, as the
Surviving Bank in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the "
_Surviving Bank_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington

Business Day of the calendar month following the month in which all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), unless
another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, the Merger shall be effective as of the date and time
specified in the Certificate of Merger issued by the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions of the State of Louisiana (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of the Louisiana
Revised Statutes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
the Bank shall cease and all the property, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and assets of the Bank shall vest in the Surviving Bank, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Bank shall become the debts, liabilities,
duties and obligations of the Surviving Bank.

 

Section 1.5 _Articles of Association; Bylaws; Name and Offices_.

 

(a) The articles of association of Purchaser Bank, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of association of the
Surviving Bank following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance
with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

(b) The bylaws of Purchaser Bank, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Bank following the Merger
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law.

 

(c) The name of the Surviving Bank shall be "IBERIABANK". The main office of
the Surviving Bank shall be the branch office of the Purchaser Bank located
at 200 West Congress Street, Lafayette, Louisiana 70501. The branch offices of
the Bank and Purchaser Bank that are in lawful operation immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the branch offices of the Surviving Bank upon
consummation of the Merger, subject to the opening or closing of any offices
of Purchaser Bank that may be decided by Purchaser Bank and authorized by
applicable regulatory authorities after the date hereof.

 



2 Section 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Purchaser Bank immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Bank following the
Merger until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Purchaser Bank immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Bank following the
Merger until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or approved and qualified.

 

Section 1.8 _Reservation of Right to Change Structure_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, before the Effective
Time, the parties may by mutual agreement change the method of effecting the
business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent they
deem such a change to be desirable; _provided_ , that (A) any such change
shall not affect the United States federal income tax consequences of the
Merger to holders of Bank Common Stock, and (B) no such change shall (i) alter
or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders
of Bank Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the Merger.

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Bank Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Bank,
Purchaser, Purchaser Bank or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Bank, Purchaser or Purchaser Bank:

(a) Each share of Bank Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Bank
Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) any Dissenting Bank Shares (as hereinafter defined) and
(ii) any shares of Bank Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.2(c)_) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to the other provisions of
this _Article II_ , 1.9749 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_
"), and subject to payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock as provided in _Section 2.4_.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Measurement Price_ " means the
arithmetic mean of the daily volume weighted average trading prices of
Purchaser Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as calculated by
Bloomberg Screen AQR using reported trading prices between the hours of 9:30
AM Eastern Time and 4:00 PM Eastern Time) on each of the ten (10) trading
days ending one (1) Business Day immediately prior to the day of the Effective
Time. The Exchange Ratio is subject to further adjustment as set forth below:

 



3 (i) if the Measurement Price is greater than $94.88 per share, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient (rounded to the
nearest ten-thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $187.3785 by the
Measurement Price; or

 

(ii) if the Measurement Price is less than $70.13 per share, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to equal the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth of a share) obtained by dividing $138.4997 by the Measurement
Price.

(c) Each share of Bank Common Stock owned or held by Bank or Purchaser or any
of their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (other
than shares held in trust accounts or otherwise held in a bona fide fiduciary
or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties other than
the Bank or Purchaser and shares held, directly or indirectly, by Bank or
Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries and acquired upon exercise
of rights in respect of debt arrangements previously made in good faith)
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Purchaser shall occur (or for which the relevant record date will occur) as a
result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately
adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change.

Section 2.3  _Exchange and Payment for Bank Common Stock_.

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with an exchange agent designated by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to the Bank (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") evidence of
shares in book-entry form (or stock certificates (a " _Certificate_ ")
at Purchasers option) representing the aggregate number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock into which shares of Bank Common Stock have been
converted in accordance with _Section 2.2_, plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares in accordance with _Section 2.4_. All shares of Purchaser Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to _Sections 2.2_, _2.4_ or _2.5_ , except as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), Purchaser shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each holder of record of (i) an
outstanding Certificate or outstanding Certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Bank Common Stock ("
_Bank Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Bank Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Bank Shares_ ") which, in each case,
were converted into 

 



4  the right to receive the Purchaser Common Stock with respect thereto
pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares held by such Person
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Bank Certificates to the Exchange
Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Bank Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and shall contain such
other provisions as Purchaser or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify)
and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Bank
Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares in exchange for the Purchaser Common
Stock payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 2.2_. Upon surrender
of a Bank Certificate or Book-Entry Bank Share to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Bank Certificate or
Book-Entry Bank Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Purchaser Common Stock for each share of Bank Common Stock formerly
represented by such Bank Certificate or Book-Entry Bank Share (subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax), and such Bank Certificate
or Book-Entry Bank Share shall forthwith be canceled. In the event that any
Purchaser Common Stock is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name any Bank Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Bank Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Bank Certificate or any
related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Bank Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser and the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Bank Certificate or
Book-Entry Bank Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender or transfer, the
Purchaser Common Stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section 2.4_, payable in respect of shares of Bank Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Bank Certificate or Book-Entry Bank Shares,
as applicable, pursuant to _Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon.

 

(c) All shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued, including any cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares, upon the surrender for exchange of
Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Bank Common Stock formerly represented
by such Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares. At the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of Purchaser of the shares of Bank Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Bank
Certificates are presented to Purchaser or the Exchange Agent for transfer or
transfer is sought for Book-Entry Bank Shares, such Bank Certificates or Book-
Entry Bank Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Bank
Shares.

(d) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Purchaser; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Purchaser Common Stock or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable to holders of Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares
entitled to receive such consideration, and Purchaser

 



5  shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of Bank Certificates and Book-Entry Bank Shares in the
amount of any such losses to the extent necessary for payment of the
Purchaser Common Stock. Any interest or other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Purchaser or as directed by Purchaser.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any income earned thereon) that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank
Shares for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be paid to Purchaser or as directed by Purchaser,
and any holders of Bank Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Purchaser (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for
payment of the Purchaser Common Stock with respect to shares of Bank Common
Stock formerly represented by such Bank Certificate or Book-Entry Bank Share,
in each case without interest thereon.

(f) None of Purchaser, Purchaser Bank, the Bank, or the Exchange Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, or any cash
in lieu of fractional shares, in each case properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(g) If any Bank Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, of that fact by the Person claiming such Bank Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or Purchaser with respect to such Bank
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Bank Certificate the Purchaser Common Stock payable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(h) Each of Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of
Bank Common Stock or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts that are so deducted and
withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Purchaser
or the Exchange Agent and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each holder that is
to receive a distribution pursuant to this Agreement will have the sole and
exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any such
withholding Tax obligations imposed on Purchaser by any Governmental Entity on
account of such distribution and (ii) no distribution will be made to or on
behalf of such holder pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such holder
has made arrangements satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Exchange Agent for
the payment and satisfaction of such withholding Tax obligations.

 

Section 2.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Article II_, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued
pursuant to the Merger. Instead, Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid to the
holder of any shares of Bank Common Stock that

 



6  would, pursuant to this _Article II_ , otherwise be entitled to receive
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the
nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (x) the fraction
of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled (after
taking into account all shares of Bank Common Stock owned by such holder at
the Effective Time to be converted into Purchaser Common Stock) and (y) the
Measurement Price.

Section 2.5 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock
issuable with respect to shares of Bank Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Bank
Certificates or Book-Entry Bank Shares until those Bank Certificates or Book-
Entry Bank Shares are surrendered as provided in this _Article II_. Upon
surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to those shares of
Purchaser Common Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of this surrender and not previously
paid.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Bank Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares of Bank Common Stock
pursuant to 12 C.F.R. §552.14 (" _Dissenting Bank Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Purchaser Common Stock, unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under applicable Law. If
any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to
appraisal, each such share of Bank Common Stock of such holder shall thereupon
be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as
of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal
has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Purchaser Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.4_. Bank shall serve prompt notice to Purchaser of
any demands for appraisal of any shares of Bank Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other instruments received
by Bank relating to rights to appraisal, and Purchaser shall have the right
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Bank shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
make any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. In the event that after the Effective Time a
dissenting stockholder of the Bank fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws
or loses, such holders right to appraisal and of payment for such holders
shares, Purchaser shall issue and deliver Purchaser Common Stock plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.4_ to which such
holder of shares of Bank Common Stock is entitled under _Section 2.2_ of
this Agreement upon surrender by such holder of the Bank Certificate(s)
representing shares of Bank Common Stock held by such holder in accordance
with _Section 2.3_.

 



7 Section 2.7 _Treatment of Bank Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards of
Bank_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Bank Common Stock
granted under the Bank Equity Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Bank Stock
Option_ ") shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Bank Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into a cash payment by the Bank
(subject to required tax withholdings) in an amount equal to the difference
between (i) the product of the Exchange Ratio (as may be adjusted) and the
Measurement Price (" _Per Share Consideration_ "), and (ii) the exercise
price per share (the " _Option Payment_ "), it being understood that any Bank
Stock Option with an exercise price greater than the Per Share Consideration
shall not be entitled to receive any consideration in respect of such Bank
Stock Option or the termination and cancellation thereof. Prior to the receipt
of the Option Payment and at the Effective Time, each holder of a Bank Stock
Option shall execute a cancellation agreement, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser and the Bank. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Bank
shall deliver the Option Payment to the holders of the Bank Stock Options. The
Bank shall take all actions necessary (including adopting any necessary
resolutions with respect to the Bank Stock Option), to effect the foregoing.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Bank Common Stock subject
to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Bank Equity
Plan (each, a " _Bank Restricted Stock Award_ "), whether time-vesting or
performance-based, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall vest at the Effective Time and holders of
each share of Bank Common Stock issued pursuant to the Bank Restricted Stock
Award shall be entitled to receive the consideration set forth in _Section
2.2_ of this Agreement. The Bank shall take all actions necessary (including
adopting any necessary resolutions with respect to the Bank Restricted Stock
Award), to effect the foregoing.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BANK

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by the Bank to
Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Bank Disclosure
Letter_ ") (which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this _Article III_ , or to one or
more of the Banks covenants contained herein, _provided_ , that disclosure in
any section of the Bank Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the indicated
Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to another
Section of this Agreement and _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item in the Bank Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would have a Bank Material Adverse Effect), the Bank
represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing (except to the extent made only as of a specified date, in
which case as of such date) as follows:

to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as

ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii),
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Bank
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Bank has previously made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of the Banks articles of association (the " _Bank Articles_ ") and
bylaws (the " _Bank Bylaws_ ") and the articles or certificate of

debentures, notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the

Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any such securities or to issue, grant, deliver, register, transfer or sell,
or cause to be issued, granted, delivered, registered, transferred or sold,
any such securities. Except for this Agreement, there are no
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
to which the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or on file with the
Bank or its Subsidiaries with respect to the holding, voting, registration,
redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that restricts the transfer of,
any capital stock or other equity interest of the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries has any trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities or other similar securities issued
or outstanding.

(c) Neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any
director of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.3  _Subsidiaries_. _Section 3.3_ of the Bank Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of (a) each
Subsidiary of the Bank, including its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation and (b) each other Person that is not a Subsidiary but in which the
Bank holds, directly or indirectly, a 5% or greater equity interest (each, a "
_Minority Interest Business_ "), and in each case the number of equity
interests held, directly or indirectly, by the Bank in such Subsidiary or
Minority Interest Business, as the case may be, and the percentage of the
Banks direct or indirect equity interest in such Subsidiary or Minority
Interest Business, as the case may be, relative to all outstanding equity
interests (on a fully diluted basis). All the outstanding shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of the
Bank have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are not subject to any preemptive or similar rights. All of
the shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests of each
Subsidiary of the Bank and each Minority Interest Business that are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Bank or a Subsidiary thereof are free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, options, rights of first
refusal, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer or other disposition or
exercise of any other attribute of ownership) (collectively, " _Liens_ ")
other than restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws. Except
for (x) the capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its
Subsidiaries and (y) its interests in the

 



10  Minority Interest Businesses, the Bank does not own, directly or indirectly,
any 5% or greater equity, membership interest, partnership interest, joint
venture interest in any Person, or any interest convertible into, exercisable
or exchangeable for, any of the foregoing. The Bank does not own, beneficially
or of record, either directly or indirectly, any stock or equity interest in
any depository institution (as defined in 12 U.S.C. §1813(c)(1)).

Section 3.4 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Bank has all necessary power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the
Bank Stockholder Approval (as hereinafter defined) to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Bank and the consummation by the Bank of the Transactions have been duly and
validly approved by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Bank
and no other proceedings on the part of the Bank are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, subject in the case of the
consummation of the Merger and assuming the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Transactions by the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3rds)
of the shares of Bank Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Bank Stockholders Meeting as required by applicable Law and the Banks
governing documents (such approval, hereinafter referred to as the " _Bank
Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Bank and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
each other party hereto, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Bank, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally or by
general principles of equity).

 

(b) The Bank Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of Bank and its
stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, (iii) directing that this Agreement and the Transactions
be submitted to the stockholders of Bank at the Bank Stockholders Meeting
for adoption and approval and (iv) recommending that Banks stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Transactions
(the " _Bank Recommendation_ "), which resolutions have not been subsequently
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, except as may be permitted by
_Section 5.3_.

 

(c) Assuming the accuracy, as of the record date for the determination of Bank
stockholders entitled to vote at the Bank Stockholders Meeting, the Bank
Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
Bank Common Stock or other securities required in connection with the
consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Bank do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance by the Bank with
the provisions hereof do not, and will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result 

 



11  in, termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
obligation or remedy or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) in or upon any of the
properties, assets or rights of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
provision of (i) the Bank Articles or the Bank Bylaws, or the articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
of any Subsidiary of the Bank, (ii) any Contract to which the Bank or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or (iii) subject to
the governmental filings and other matters referred to in _Section 3.5(b)_,
any Law or any rule or regulation of any self-regulatory authority applicable
to the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or by which the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Bank Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of, or registrations,
declarations or filings with or notices to, any Governmental Entities or any
third party are required to be made or obtained by the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the
Bank of this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, except for (i)
filings of applications and notices with, receipt of approvals or no
objections from, and the expiration of related waiting periods required by,
federal and state banking authorities, including applications and notices
under the BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, 12 C.F.R. §5.33(k) and Title 6 of the
Louisiana Revised Statutes, (ii) filings of applications and notices with, and
receipt of approvals or non-objections from, the state securities authorities,
applicable securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, (iii)
filing of (A) a proxy statement relating to the approval of this Agreement by
the Banks stockholders (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for inclusion in a
registration statement on Form S-4 prepared by Purchaser in connection with
the issuance of the Purchaser Common Stock in the Merger and related
transactions (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") pursuant to the Securities Act, and (B) such
other filings and reports as required pursuant to the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and (iv) such other filings with
third parties who are not Governmental Entities the failure of which to be
obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Bank Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof,
assuming compliance by Purchaser with its obligations under this Agreement,
the Bank does not have knowledge of any reason why all regulatory approvals
from any Governmental Entities required for the consummation of the
Transactions and listed in items (i) through (iv) of this _Section
3.5(b)_ would not be obtained on a timely basis.

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Bank has previously made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of the audited consolidated financial statements of the
Bank (including the related notes thereto) as of and for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, and the unaudited consolidated financial
statements as of and for the six (6)-month period ending June 30, 2017
(collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods

17 (c) With respect to each Bank Plan, except to the extent that the inaccuracy

Code, and other applicable Law, and all contributions required to be made

administrative proceeding) by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the IRS or
any other Governmental Entity or by any plan participant or beneficiary
pending or, to the knowledge of the Bank, threatened relating to Bank Plans,
any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to Bank Plans or the
assets of any of the trusts under any Bank Plans (other than routine claims
for benefits) nor, to the knowledge of the Bank, are there facts or
circumstances that exist that could reasonably give rise to any such Actions,

Bank Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) or Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) and neither the Bank, its Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has at any time sponsored or contributed to, or has or had

combination with another event) (i) result in severance pay or any increase in
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment or benefit upon
any termination of employment after the date of this Agreement, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,

or restrict the right of the Bank to merge, amend, or terminate any of the
Bank Plans, (iv) directly or indirectly cause the Bank to transfer or
set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Bank Plan, (v) otherwise
give rise to any material liability under any Bank Plan, (vi) result in the
payment of payments or benefit that would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code) to any current or former employee, director, officer or independent
contractor of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(f) No Bank Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States.

asserting that the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair
labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act of

any operations or activities of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries at any
location, and no other condition has existed or event has occurred with

knowledge, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, or diluting in any
material respect any Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to

take all reasonable actions that are compliant in all material respects with
applicable industry standards to protect and maintain the confidentiality,
continuous operation and security of their IT Assets (and all information
stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized
use, access, interruption, modification or corruption, and since December 31,
2013 there have been no violations, breaches or outages of (or unauthorized
access to or use of) the same (other than those that were resolved without
material liability or expense or an obligation to notify any other Person of
such event). The Bank and its Subsidiaries have implemented
commercially reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and
disaster avoidance and recovery procedures with respect to the IT Assets, in

Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither the Bank nor its
Subsidiaries, nor to the Banks knowledge, any other party thereto, is in
breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or arrangement,

under or with respect to each such Derivative Transaction has been reflected
in the books and records of the Bank and such Subsidiaries in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Derivative Transaction_ "

properly administered in all material respects all accounts for which it acts
as a fiduciary, including accounts for which it serves as trustee, agent,

their respective current or former directors, officers or employees has
committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account. The
records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material
respects and accurately reflect in all material respects the assets of such
fiduciary account.

Subsidiaries, (ii) no Loans to any employee, officer or director of the Bank

applicable investors) and with all applicable requirements of Laws and
applicable requirements of any government-sponsored enterprise program. The
Bank and its Subsidiaries have properly fulfilled in all material respects
their contractual responsibilities and duties in any Loans in which they act
as the lead lender or servicer and have complied in all material respects with
their duties as required under applicable regulatory requirements.

accruing or the Loans are less than ninety (90) days past due, (E) where the
interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been
extended subsequent to the agreement under which the Loan was originally
created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance

_Section 3.24(d)_ of the Bank Disclosure Letter sets forth the outstanding
balance, including accrued and unpaid interest, on each such Loan and the
identity of the borrower thereunder as of such date. True and complete copies
of the currently effective lending policies and practices of the Bank and each

hereof.

 



29 (e) Each outstanding Loan (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other

outstanding Loan were in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws at the time of origination or purchase by the Bank or its
Subsidiaries and are complete and correct in all material respects.

 

(f) To the knowledge of the Bank, each Loan included in a pool of Loans
originated, acquired or serviced by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (a "
_Pool_ ") meets all eligibility requirements (including all applicable
requirements for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and loan guaranty
certificates) for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have been
finally certified or, if required, recertified in accordance with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, except where the time for

representations or warranties contained in this _Article IV_ , or to one or
more of Purchasers covenants contained herein, _provided_ , that disclosure
in any section of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall apply only to the
indicated Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to
another Section of this Agreement, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the mere
inclusion of an item in the Purchaser Disclosure Letter as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect) or
(ii) as disclosed in any Purchaser SEC Document publicly available prior to
the date hereof and only as and to the extent disclosed therein, but

ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets makes such

where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



31 (b) Purchaser has previously made available to the Bank true and complete
copies of Purchasers articles of incorporation (the " _Purchaser Charter_ ")
and bylaws (the " _Purchaser Bylaws_ "), in each case as amended to the date

approved by all necessary corporate or other similar action on the part of
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank. Concurrently with the execution of this

other Transactions, and no other proceedings on the part of Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Bank, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, enforceable against each of them in accordance
with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent
transfer or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity).

(b) No vote of the shareholders of Purchaser or the holders of any other

Law, the Purchaser Charter or the Purchaser Bylaws to consummate the
Transactions.

 

Section 4.4 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Purchaser do
not, and the consummation of the Transactions and compliance by Purchaser
with the provisions hereof do not, and will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in,
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or
remedy or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) in or upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision
of (i) the Purchaser Charter or Purchaser Bylaws, or the articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
of any Significant Subsidiary of 

 



33  Purchaser, (ii) any material Contract to which Purchaser or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
(iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
_Section 4.4(b)_, any Law or any rule or regulation of any self-regulatory
authority applicable to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

declarations or filings with or notices to, any Governmental Entities or any
third party are required to be made or obtained by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by

of the listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued
in the Merger; and (v) such other filings with third parties who are not
Governmental Entities the failure of which to be obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, assuming compliance by the
Bank with its obligations under this Agreement, Purchaser has no knowledge of
any reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental
Entities required for the consummation of the Transactions and listed in
items (i) through (v) of this _Section 4.4(b)_ should not be obtained on a
timely basis.

 

Section 4.5 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

Subsidiaries in writing specifically for inclusion therein) will comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act.

 

Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2016,
there has not been any change, event or development or prospective change,

or otherwise), has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. There is no Action, whether judicial,
arbitral, administrative or other, pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser,
threatened against or affecting Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, any of
their respective properties or assets, or any present or former officer,

lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
and operations as now conducted, and to Purchasers knowledge no suspension or
cancellation of any such Permits is threatened, and there has occurred no

modification or cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both, any such Permit.

(b) Purchaser is duly registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding

Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any applicable Laws
or Permits, (ii) threatening to revoke any Permits, (iii) requiring Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or consent to the issuance of a

letter or other formal or informal enforcement action of any kind that
imposes any material restrictions on the conduct of Purchasers business or
that relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or risk management policies,
its dividend policy, its management, its business or its operations (any
of the foregoing, a " _Purchaser Regulatory Agreement_ "), or (iv)
threatening or contemplating revocation or limitation of, or which would have
the effect of revoking or limiting FDIC insurance coverage. Neither Purchaser
nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or subject to any Purchaser
Regulatory Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

and the regulations promulgated thereunder and has received a CRA rating of
"satisfactory" in its most recently completed exam, and Purchaser does not
have knowledge of the existence of any fact or circumstance or set of facts

_Article IV_ , neither Purchaser nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Purchaser, its Subsidiaries
or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions
(financial or otherwise) or prospects, and Purchaser hereby disclaims any
such other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, except for the representations and warranties made by
Purchaser in this _Article IV_ , neither Purchaser nor any other Person makes
or has made any representation or warranty to the Bank or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives with respect to (i) any financial

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the Bank nor any other Person
has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to the Bank
whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the Bank in
_Article III_ hereof, including any implied representation or warranty as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Bank furnished
or made available to Purchaser or any of its Representatives. Without limiting

Section 5.2 _Conduct of Business by Purchaser_. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Closing, except as consented to in writing in
advance by the Bank, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
or as otherwise specifically required by this Agreement or as set forth in
_Section 5.2_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization,
maintain in effect all Permits existing as of the date hereof, preserve its
assets, rights and properties in good repair and condition, and preserve
its relationships with customers, suppliers and others having business
dealings with it. In addition to and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing,
except as set forth in  _Section 5.2_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter or
as specifically required by this Agreement, Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Significant Subsidiaries, without the Banks prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to:

(a) amend, authorize or propose to amend its articles of incorporation or

(with prior written notice to the Bank) as may be required by applicable Law;
or

 



42 (c) enter into any Contract with respect to or otherwise agree or commit to
take any of the foregoing actions.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by the Bank_.

 

(a) The Bank shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use and cause its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
endorse, or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiry, proposal or offer with
respect to, or the making or completion of, any Bank Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry, proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Bank
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
nonpublic information or data or afford access to the business, directors,
officers, employees, properties, facilities, assets, contracts, books or
records of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection
with any Bank Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend any Bank
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, a " _Bank Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or is reasonably likely to result in, any Bank Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the terms of this _Section
5.3(a)_ as described below). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any
Representative of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of
this _Section 5.3(a)_ by the Bank. The Bank shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, to, (A) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Bank Acquisition
Proposal, (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any potential Bank Acquisition Proposal, (C) request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in
connection therewith and (D) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement relating to any
Bank Acquisition Proposal to which it or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is a party, and shall enforce the provisions of any such
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the date of
this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Bank Stockholder Approval, (1) the
Bank receives an unsolicited written Bank Acquisition Proposal that the Bank
Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Bank Acquisition
Proposal was not the result of a material violation of this _Section
5.3(a)_, (3) the Bank Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Bank Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Bank Superior Proposal and
(4) the Bank Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y)
of this _Section 5.3(a)_ would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then the Bank may (and may authorize its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x) furnish non-public
information with respect to the Bank and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Bank Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to,
and no less favorable to the Bank than, those set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,

 



43  that any non-public information provided to any Person given such access
shall have previously been provided to Purchaser or shall be provided to
Purchaser prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Bank Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives)
regarding such Bank Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Bank Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withhold or
withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Purchaser) the Bank
Recommendation (or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing), (B) fail to
include the Bank Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Bank
Acquisition Proposal (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.3(b)(i)_
being referred to herein as a " _Bank Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Bank
Stockholder Approval, the Bank Board may, if the Bank Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that
may be offered by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)_, make a Bank
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , that the Bank shall not make any
Bank Adverse Recommendation Change unless (A) the Bank shall not have
breached this _Section 5.3_ in any material respect and (B) if and only if:

 

(i) the Bank shall give Purchaser at least ten (10) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for the Bank Adverse Recommendation
Change, and if the proposed Bank Adverse Recommendation Change is in response
to a Bank Superior Proposal, such notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of any such Bank Superior Proposal, including the identity of
the party making such Bank Superior Proposal and contemporaneously provides an
unredacted copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party
making such Bank Superior Proposal (or if there is no such proposed
agreement, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of the Bank
Superior Proposal);

 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Bank Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Bank negotiates, and causes its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Purchaser during such notice period to the
extent Purchaser wishes to negotiate, to enable Purchaser to revise the terms
of this Agreement such that (A) in the case of a Bank Superior Proposal, it
would cause such Bank Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Bank
Superior Proposal or (B) in any other event, the failure to effect a Bank
Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably likely to violate the
Bank Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(iii) the Bank Board, following the final such ten (or five, as applicable)
Business Day period (as described below), again determines in good faith,
after consultation with such outside legal counsel and such independent
financial advisor, that (A) if the proposed Bank Adverse Recommendation Change
is in response to a Bank Superior Proposal, such Bank Acquisition Proposal
nonetheless continues to constitute a Bank Superior Proposal and (B) failure
to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate their fiduciary
duties to the Bank and the Bank stockholders under applicable Law.

 



44 In the event of any change to the price or any other material change to the
terms of such Bank Superior Proposal, the Bank shall, in each case, be
required to deliver to Purchaser a new written notice, the notice period shall
recommence and the Bank shall be required to comply with its obligations under
this _Section 5.3_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the
deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced to five (5) Business
Days (rather than ten (10) Business Days referenced in clause (i) above).

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Bank set forth in _Sections 5.3(a)_
and _(b)_ , on and after the date hereof, the Bank shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) advise Purchaser orally and in
writing in the event the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives receives (i) any Bank Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
proposal, offer or inquiry or request for information with respect to, or that
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Bank Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) any request to engage in discussions or negotiations that
are reasonably likely to lead to, or that contemplate or relate to, an actual
or potential Bank Acquisition Proposal, in each case which notice shall
include a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Bank
Acquisition Proposal or request, the identity of the Person making any such
Bank Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information
and a copy of any Bank Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or
request for information made in writing (and any proposed agreements related
thereto) and a summary of the terms and conditions of any Bank Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request for information not made in
writing. The Bank shall keep Purchaser informed (orally and in writing) in
all material respects on a timely basis of the status (including after the
occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of any such Bank
Acquisition Proposal or request and shall provide Purchaser with copies of all
material documentation and correspondence related thereto. Without limiting
any of the foregoing, the Bank shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Purchaser orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning a Bank Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_ or _(b)_
and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such
discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice.

(d) The Bank shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Bank from providing the information contemplated by this
_Section 5.3_ to Purchaser or otherwise limits or impairs the Banks or its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives ability to comply with
their respective obligations in this _Section 5.3_.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Bank Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the Transactions, any
inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a, or any, tender or exchange
offer to acquire 20% or more of the voting power in the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries, any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
consolidation, share exchange or other business combination involving the
Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or any other inquiry, proposal or offer to
acquire, license, lease, exchange or transfer in any manner 20% or more of the
voting power in (whether by purchase of newly issued or outstanding shares of
the Bank Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable for shares of
the Bank Common Stock whether or not such securities are currently
exchangeable or convertible), or 20% or more of the business, revenue, net
income, assets or deposits of, the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, whether in one or any series of related transactions and whether from
one Person or any "group" of Persons (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act).

 



45 (ii) " _Bank Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited _bona fide_
written Bank Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the
definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%) that the Bank Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the proposal and the Person (or group of Persons) making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and
conditions to consummation), (A) if consummated would be more favorable to
the stockholders of the Bank from a financial point of view than the
Transactions (including taking into account any adjustment to the terms and
conditions proposed by Purchaser in response to such proposal pursuant to 
_Section 5.3(b)_ or otherwise), (B) is not subject to any financing or other
material contingency (other than the receipt of necessary regulatory
approvals) and (C) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be completed on the
terms proposed on a timely basis.

Section 5.4 _Preparation of Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement;
Bank Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Bank
shall prepare the Proxy Statement and Purchaser shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. The Bank shall furnish all information concerning
itself and its Affiliates to Purchaser, and provide Purchaser with such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Registration Statement. Purchaser will advise
the Bank, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
to amend the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of the Bank) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto.
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions. The Bank will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Banks stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser shall
also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in
the Merger, and the Bank shall furnish all information concerning itself and
its stockholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.

(b) Purchaser will advise the Bank, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC to amend the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

 



46 (c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Bank,
Purchaser or any Subsidiary of the Bank or Purchaser, respectively, or any
change occurs with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Bank
or Purchaser, respectively, for inclusion in the Registration Statement that,
in each case, is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Registration Statement, the Bank or Purchaser, as applicable, shall
promptly notify the other of such event, and the Bank and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement and, as required by Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
Banks stockholders.

 

(d) The Bank shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective, take all action necessary,
including as required by and in accordance with applicable Law, the Bank
Charter and the Bank Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Bank Stockholders  Meeting_") for the
purpose of obtaining the Bank Stockholder Approval. Except in the case of a
Bank Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by _Section
5.3(b)_, the Bank, through the Bank Board, shall take all action necessary
to (x) recommend to its stockholders that they approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, (y) include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (z) solicit the Bank Stockholder
Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Bank agrees
that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.4(d)_
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Bank or any other Person of any Bank Acquisition
Proposal or the occurrence of any Bank Adverse Recommendation Change. The Bank
shall adjourn or postpone the Bank Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time
for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares
of the Bank Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting the Bank has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Bank Stockholder Approval,
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Bank shall
continue to use all reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from
its stockholders in favor of the Bank Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Bank Stockholders Meeting shall be convened
and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Bank at the
Bank Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of approving this Agreement and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Bank of such
obligation. In addition to the foregoing, the Bank shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Bank Acquisition Proposal in addition to or in
lieu of the Merger. If the Bank Board has effected a Bank Adverse
Recommendation Change, then the Bank Board may submit this Agreement to the
Banks stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Bank Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to Banks stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by
applicable Law.

 



47 Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, the Bank shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to all its properties, assets,
books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
the Bank shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
Purchaser: (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed, furnished or received by it during such period pursuant
to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as the other party may reasonably request (including all work
papers of its auditors and all Tax Returns filed and those in preparation);
_provided_ , that neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (A) breach any
agreement with any third party in effect on the date of this Agreement, (B)
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by such
party or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Law. In the event any of the
restrictions in clauses (A) through (C) of the foregoing sentence shall apply,
the parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements
(including, as the case may be, the Bank using reasonable best efforts to
provide appropriate consents, waivers, decrees and approvals necessary to
satisfy any confidentiality issues relating to documents prepared or held by
third parties (including work papers),and by the parties adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with applicable Laws, including antitrust Laws). As soon
as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the
date hereof, the Bank will furnish to Purchaser (x) consolidated financial
statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations
and stockholders equity) of the Bank and its Subsidiaries as of and for such
month then ended, (y) internal management financial control reports showing
actual financial performance against plan and previous period and (z) any
reports provided to the Bank Board or any committee thereof relating to the
financial performance and risk management of the Bank. In addition, the Bank
will furnish Purchaser with a copy of each report filed by it or any of its
Subsidiaries with a Governmental Entity (other than portions thereof relating
to confidential supervisory or examination materials) within three (3)
Business Days following the filing thereof.

 

(b) All such information shall be held confidential in accordance with the
terms of the amended and restated letter agreement regarding confidentiality,
dated as of October 11, 2017, between Purchaser and the Bank (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or information provided,
made available or delivered to the Bank or Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement (other than the Bank Disclosure Letter and the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter to the extent explicitly provided therein) shall affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions
to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using 

 



48  reasonable best efforts to resist, contest or defend any Actions (including
administrative Actions) challenging the Transactions or the completion of the
Transactions, and using reasonable best efforts to seek to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could
restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall preclude any party from exercising its
rights under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.6_, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall be required to take any action, or commit to take any action,
or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining or
complying with any Requisite Regulatory Approvals (as defined below) that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, properties,
assets, liabilities or results of operations of (x) the Bank and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, following the Closing (either of clauses (x) or (y), a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of
any Governmental Entity, Purchaser shall inform Bank in writing if any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over Purchaser or its Subsidiaries has
advised or notified any of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of such Governmental
Entitys determination to impose a restriction or requirement in connection
with or as a result of the Transactions, which upon compliance therewith would
constitute a Burdensome Condition, including reasonable detail regarding the
restriction or requirement imposed by the Governmental Entity; provided,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser be obligated to
provide the Bank with any information relating to or containing any
confidential supervisory or regulatory examination materials or information.

(b) The parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as
possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities necessary to
consummate the Transactions (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and
will make all necessary filings in respect of those Requisite Regulatory
Approvals as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty (30)
days following the date of this Agreement. Each party will have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each party will consult with
the other party, in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, all information relating to it and any of
its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with or written materials
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall either party or any of its respective Affiliates be obligated to
provide the other party with any information relating to or containing any
confidential supervisory or regulatory examination materials or information.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with
the other party with respect to obtaining all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, and each party will keep the
other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion
of the Transactions. The parties shall promptly deliver to each other copies
of all filings, correspondence and orders to and from all Governmental
Entities in connection with the Transactions, including seeking the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , that Purchaser and its Subsidiaries may
redact such information as may reasonably be considered proprietary,
sensitive or confidential (including financial projections, business plans or
personal information).

 



49 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall, upon request, furnish to each other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In exercising
the foregoing rights, each party shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, each party shall keep the other party reasonably apprised
of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions,
including promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or
other written communications received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser or its Subsidiaries be
obligated to provide the Bank with any information relating to or containing
any confidential supervisory or regulatory examination materials or
information.

 

Section 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. Each of the Bank and Purchaser and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (a) take no action to cause any
"moratorium," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination,"
"control share acquisition", "interested stockholder" or similar provision of
any anti-takeover Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") to become
applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Law
is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, use reasonable
best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions. 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Bank, on the one hand, and
Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each
other of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions by or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which, in any such case, relate to the
Transactions or (c) any change, condition or event (i) that renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate to an extent such
that the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_, as
applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then occur or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of
such party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in _Article VI_ ) to
be complied with or satisfied by such party hereunder; _provided_ , that no
such notification, nor any failure to make such notification, shall affect
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Subject to any limitations that may be imposed by applicable Law, for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless each of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") to the fullest extent permitted by the current
provisions regarding indemnification of DandO Indemnified Parties contained in
the Bank Articles and the Bank Bylaws (or comparable organizational documents
of each of the Banks

 



50  Subsidiaries), arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part
out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Bank, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the Transactions,
and Purchaser shall also advance expenses as incurred in each case, upon
receipt of an undertaking, from such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such
advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction that such DandO Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification hereunder. In the event any claim is asserted
within such six (6)-year period, all such rights in respect of any such claim
shall continue until disposition thereof.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
maintain in effect the Banks current directors and officers liability
insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Banks directors and
officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete copy of which has
been heretofore made available to Purchaser) for acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 150% of
the amount of the aggregate premiums paid by the Bank for fiscal year 2016
for such purpose (which fiscal year 2016 premiums are hereby represented and
warranted by the Bank to be as set forth in _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Bank
Disclosure Letter (the " _Insurance Amount_ ")) and, if Purchaser is unable
to maintain such policy (or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso,
Purchaser shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for a
period of six years following the Effective Time by payment of such amount;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (i) Purchaser may substitute therefor "tail"
policies the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than
the Banks existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) Purchaser may
request that the Bank obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the
Banks existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time).

(c) In the event that Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successor and assign of Purchaser assumes the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each DandO Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

Section 5.10  _Employees_.

(a) Immediately following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the
individuals employed by the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing who continue in the employment of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") to receive aggregate target cash
compensation opportunities and employee benefits (other than with respect to
equity-based, change in control, or transaction-based compensation or

 



51  benefits, defined benefit pension benefits or retiree health or welfare
benefits) that are substantially comparable to those provided to such
employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in
this _Section 5.10_ shall (A) be construed to create (x) any third-party
beneficiary rights in any current or former employee of the Bank, Purchaser or
their Affiliates (including any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement (including any participant in
any Bank Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (y) any right to
employment or continued employment for any specified period or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates,
or (B) except as set forth in this _Section 5.10_, limit the ability of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Bank
Plan, Purchaser Plan or other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Bank and its Subsidiaries)
other than defined benefit pension plans (such employee benefit plans shall be
referred to hereinafter as the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") providing benefits to
any Continuing Employee, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with Bank and its Affiliates and their respective
predecessors to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled to
credit for such service under any applicable similar Bank Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Purchaser Plans to the
extent coverage under such Purchaser Plan is similar in type to an applicable
Bank Plan in which such Continuing Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) for purposes of each Purchaser Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to
any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such Purchaser Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the similar plans of Bank or its Affiliates in which
such Continuing Employee, as applicable, participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing, the Bank and
each of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, effective as of the Closing Date,
any Bank Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Code Section 401(k) (a " _401(k) Plan_ ").

 

(e) To the extent that any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to receive
severance pursuant to the terms of the Purchasers Severance Pay Plan (the "
_Purchaser Severance Plan_ ") prior to the first anniversary of the Closing,
then such terminated Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive (x) a
severance payment equal to two (2) weeks of such Continuing Employees then-
current base salary for each completed year of service to the Bank, its
Affiliates and Purchaser, with a minimum of four (4) weeks of base salary and
a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks of base salary plus (y) subsidized COBRA
benefits, on such terms provided by the Purchaser Severance Plan, for a period
of three (3) months.

 



52 (f) Prior to the Closing, the Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take such actions that are intended to ensure that the payment of any amounts
or benefits (whether or not accelerated) to a "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) in connection with the Transactions,
would not, separately or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in the disallowance of a deduction to the Bank or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, under Section 280G of the Code, including, as necessary, (i)
soliciting the requisite approval of the Banks direct or indirect
stockholders of all or a portion of any such payments or benefits, in a manner
that meets the shareholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-7 (including providing
such members adequate disclosure of all material facts concerning any such
payments or benefit as provided in, and otherwise conducting such solicitation
in conformity with, Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code) and (ii) to the extent
necessary, attempting to obtain a waiver from each such "disqualified
individual" entitled to receive any payments or benefits which would
reasonably be expected, individually or when aggregated with other
payments or benefits, to cause or trigger any "parachute payment" (as defined
in Section 280G(b) of the Code) in connection with the Transactions of such
disqualified individuals right to receive the portion of such payments or
benefits that would reasonably be expected to, individually or when
aggregated with other payments or benefits, cause or trigger any "excess
parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code). The Bank
shall provide Purchaser with drafts of all such solicitation materials and
consents for review and comment prior to delivery to stockholders or
disqualified individuals, as applicable. Prior to the Closing, the Bank shall
deliver to Purchaser, reasonably satisfactory evidence that a vote of the
Banks stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 5.10_ and whether or not the requisite number of stockholder
votes consenting to such benefits and payments was obtained with respect to
such benefits and payments.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and without limiting
the generality of this _Section 5.10_, all provisions contained in this
_Section 5.10_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Bank Plan or
other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit
the right of Purchaser or the Bank or their respective Subsidiaries or
affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Bank Plan or other
employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Closing
Date or (iii) shall confer upon any other Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (including any stockholder, any service provider, Continuing
Employee or any participant in any Bank Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)) any
right to continued or resumed employment or recall, any right to specific
compensation or benefits, or any third-party beneficiary or other right of any
kind or nature whatsoever.

Section 5.11  _Public Announcements_. Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, on the
one hand, and the Bank, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other
with respect to the issuing of any press release or other public statements
with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions and, without the prior
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



53  the Bank shall not issue any such press release or make any public
announcement, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. It is understood that
Purchaser shall assume primary responsibility for the preparation of joint
press releases relating to this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

Section 5.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall
file a Notification of Listing of Additional Shares (or such other form as
may be required by NASDAQ) with NASDAQ with respect to the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such shares to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing.

Section 5.13 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Bank or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Bank,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Bank and Purchaser shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 5.14 _Operating Functions_. The Bank and its Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries in connection with planning for
the efficient and orderly combination of the parties and their respective
operations after the Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions to be effective at the Effective Time or such
later date as Purchaser may decide. The Bank shall take any action Purchaser
may reasonably request prior to the Effective Time to facilitate
the combination of the operations of the Bank with Purchaser Bank. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Bank shall provide office space and support
services (and other reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection
with the foregoing, and senior officers of the Bank and Purchaser shall meet
from time to time as Purchaser may reasonably request, to review the financial
and operational affairs of the Bank and its Subsidiaries, and the Bank shall
give due consideration to Purchasers input on such matters, with the
understanding that neither the Bank nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to agree to any material Contractual obligation that is not
contingent upon the consummation of the Closing.

 

Section 5.15 _Advisory Board_. Following the Closing, Purchaser shall invite
members of the Bank Board to join Purchasers Miami-Dade Advisory Board.

Section 5.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. Bank shall promptly advise Purchaser
orally and in writing of any actual or threatened stockholder litigation
against the Bank or its directors and officers relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other Transactions and shall promptly provide Purchaser with a
copy of the complaint or other writing threatening or commencing such
stockholder litigation. Bank shall: (i) permit Purchaser to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the Purchaser in
connection with, any proposed written or oral response to such stockholder
litigation; (ii) furnish Purchasers outside legal counsel with all non-
privileged information and documents which outside counsel may reasonably
request in connection with such stockholder litigation; (iii) consult
with Purchaser regarding the defense or

 



54  settlement of any such stockholder litigation, shall give due consideration
to Purchasers advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall
not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Bank shall not settle any such stockholder
litigation if such settlement requires the payment of money damages unless the
payment of any such damages by Bank is reasonably expected by Bank, following
consultation with outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any
deductible to be paid by the Bank) under the Banks existing director and
officer insurance policies, including any tail policy, without the written
consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

Section 5.17 _WARN Act_. The Bank agrees that, upon Purchasers written
request, it shall provide a notification under the WARN Act for any Bank or
its Subsidiaries employee terminations or layoffs following the Closing.

Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, the

its own attorneys fees, accountants fees and related expenses in connection

59 (b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) a Bank Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or intention
to make a Bank Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall have
been made directly to the Banks stockholders or otherwise publicly disclosed
or otherwise communicated or made known to senior management of the Bank or
the Bank Board, (B) this Agreement is thereafter terminated by the Bank or
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section
7.1(c)(i)_, and (C) within fifteen (15) months after such termination the Bank
or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, any Bank Acquisition
Proposal (which, in each case, need not be the same Bank Acquisition Proposal

(the " _Bank Termination Fee_ ") on the earlier of (i) the date of execution
of such agreement or (ii) consummation of such transaction; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ then, in any such event, the Bank

no event shall the Bank be required to pay an aggregate amount exceeding the
Bank Termination Fee.

 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 7.3_, " _Bank Acquisition Proposal_ " shall

references to "20%" shall be replaced by "50%".

(d) Payment of the Bank Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of
same day funds to the account or accounts designated by Purchaser (i) at the

promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event,
within two Business Days thereof), in the case of termination by Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_. The right to
receive and the payment of the Bank Termination Fee to Purchaser shall be
Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy and shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages.

 

(e) Each of Bank and Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if either the Bank or Purchaser fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the non-
paying party for the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3_, the non-paying
party shall pay to other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this _Section 7.3_ from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate published in _The Wall Street_ _Journal_ on the date such payment was
required to be made.

 



60 Section 7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended, modified
or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Bank Stockholder Approval has been obtained;
_provided_ , that after the Bank Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption by the stockholders of Bank without such further approval
or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in
any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument
in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of
each of the parties in interest at the time of the amendment. 

Section 7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
