                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of May 4,
2006, by and among APPLIED MATERIALS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
BLUE ACQUISITION, INC., a Colorado corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and APPLIED FILMS CORPORATION, a Colorado corporation
(the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Exhibit A.

                                    RECITALS

     A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement, the CBCA and
the CCAA (the "Merger"). Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease
to exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

     B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement, the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions.

                                    AGREEMENT

     The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

     SECTION 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

         1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

         1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the CBCA and the CCAA.

         1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The closing of the Merger and the
consummation of those transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are to be
consummated at the time of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Cooley Godward LLP, 3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, on a
date to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later
than the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 (other than
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.5 and 7.4, which by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions). The Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of a
statement of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado in
accordance with the CBCA and the CCAA or at such later time as may be specified
in such statement of merger with the consent of Parent (the time as of which the
Merger becomes effective being referred to as the "Effective Time").

         1.4 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.
Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

<PAGE>

                  (A) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
         shall be amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time in a
         form acceptable to Parent;

                  (B) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
         and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of
         Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

                  (C) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
         immediately after the Effective Time shall be the respective
         individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately
         prior to the Effective Time.

         1.5 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK.

                  (A) At the Effective Time, by virtue of, and simultaneously
with, the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company:

                           (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the
         Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior
         to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
         exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

                           (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by
         Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
         immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired
         and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
         exchange therefor;

                           (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
         above, and subject to Section 1.5(b), each share of Company Common
         Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
         converted into the right to receive $28.50 in cash, without any
         interest thereon (the "Merger Consideration");

                           (iv) all Company Options and Company Stock Awards
         shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.3; and

                           (v) each share of common stock, without par value, of
         Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
         converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (B) If, during the period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of
any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of
bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is
declared by the Company during such period, or a record date with respect to any
such event shall occur during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to the extent appropriate.
                                       2

<PAGE>

                  (C) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract with the
Company or under which the Company has any rights, then the Merger Consideration
payable in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option or obligation, risk of
forfeiture or other condition and need not be paid until such time as such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise
terminates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Merger
Consideration payable in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock subject
to those certain Pledge Agreements as set forth in Part 1.5(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall become subject to the terms of such Pledge Agreements
as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other Contract.

         1.6 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time: (a)
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights as shareholders of the Company, other than the right of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration
set forth herein; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any shares of
Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Paying
Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.7.

         1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

                  (A) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent in connection with
the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). Prior to or at the Closing, Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Persons who were
record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the Effective
Time, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iii). The cash amount so deposited with the Paying Agent is
referred to as the "Payment Fund."

                  (B) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock
certificates to the Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Company Stock

                                       3

<PAGE>

Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Company Stock Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by the Company Stock Certificate; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. If any cash is to be paid to a
Person other than the record holder of a Company Stock Certificate, it shall be
a condition of such payment that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (with such signature guarantees as may be required by
the letter of transmittal) or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the Person requesting payment shall: (1) pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the record
holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered; or (2) establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not required to be
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, without interest thereon. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of any Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond, in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

                  (C) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed
to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the
Closing Date shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered
their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

                  (D) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent determines in good faith may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

                  (E) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law
or other Legal Requirement.

         1.8 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is held by a shareholder who
is entitled to exercise, and who has made a demand for, dissenters' rights in
accordance with Article 113 of the CBCA (such share being a "Dissenting Share,"
and such shareholder being a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but rather shall be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to the CBCA. If any
Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect such shareholder's dissenters' rights
under the CBCA or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, then as of the later of the Effective Time or
the date of loss of such rights, such Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate representing such
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent: (a) prompt notice of any
demand for payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common Stock or
any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and any other instrument
served pursuant to the CBCA and received by the Company relating to any
shareholder's dissenters' rights; and (b) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under
the CBCA. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or
make an offer to settle, any such demand for payment at any time prior to the
Effective Time, unless the Company shall have first obtained Parent's consent.

         1.9 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

     SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it
being understood that: (i) each representation and warranty contained in this
Section 2 is subject to the exceptions and disclosures set forth in the Company

shall constitute an exception or qualification to each of the representations
and warranties of the Company if the disclosure contains sufficient detail to
enable a reasonable person to recognize the relevance of such disclosure to the
other representations and warranties; (iii) a representation that a document or
material required to be delivered or otherwise provided to Parent shall be
deemed satisfied if such document or material was made available to Parent in
the Intralinks online due diligence data room for the Contemplated Transactions
by 11:59 p.m. on May 1, 2006 (California Time); and (iv) the mere inclusion of
an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission by
the Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect):

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange

Company in the reports that it is required to file, submit or furnish under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with
the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company has delivered to
Parent accurate and complete copies of all written descriptions of, and all
policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls and
procedures. The Company is, and has at all times been, in compliance with the
applicable listing and other rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market
and has not received any notice from the NASDAQ National Market asserting any
non-compliance with any of such rules and regulations.

                  (C) Except as set forth in Part 2.4(c) of the Company

                                       9
<PAGE>

restated in any Company SEC Documents filed or furnished prior to the date of
this Agreement; (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated in

financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal and
recurring adjustments that will not, individually or in the aggregate, be
material in amount); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby. No financial statements of any Person other than the Acquired
Corporations are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

                  (D) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company's auditor has

asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance

intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Part
2.4(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the Acquired Corporations'
internal controls over financial reporting that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability of the Acquired Corporations to record, process,
summarize and report financial information. The Company has delivered to Parent
accurate and complete copies of, all written descriptions of, and all policies,
manuals and other documents promulgating, such internal accounting controls.

applicable zoning, land use, building, fire, health, labor, safety and
Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 2.16(f)) and other Legal Requirements.
There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, that challenges or adversely affects, or would challenge or
adversely affect, the continuation of the present ownership, use or operation of
any Company Real Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no existing
plan or study by any Governmental Body or by any other Person that challenges or
otherwise adversely affects the continuation of the present ownership, use or
operation of any Company Real Property. Except as set forth in Part 2.7(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no subleases, licenses, occupancy
agreements or other contractual obligations that grant the right of use or
occupancy of any of the Company Real Property to any Person other than the
Acquired Corporations, and there is no Person in possession of any of the
Company Real Property other than the Acquired Corporations.

                  (C) All material items of equipment and other tangible assets
owned by or leased to the Acquired Corporations are adequate for the uses to
which they are being put, are in good and safe condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) and, with due regard to the age thereof, are adequate
for the conduct of the businesses of the Acquired Corporations in the manner in
which such businesses are currently being conducted.

         2.8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

         of any nature (whether exclusively, jointly with another Person or
         otherwise); (B) the jurisdiction in which such item of Registered IP
         has been registered or filed and the applicable registration or serial

         any other Person that has an ownership interest in such domain name or
         item of Registered IP and the nature of such ownership interest; and

                           (ii) in Part 2.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure

         Rights or Intellectual Property is licensed to any Acquired Corporation

         the scope of use currently exercised by such Acquired Corporation, at a
         cost of less than $25,000); and (B) whether these licenses are
         exclusive or nonexclusive (for purposes of this Agreement, a covenant
         not to sue or not to assert infringement claims shall be deemed to be
         equivalent to a license).

                  (B) The Company has delivered to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of each standard form of the following documents and Contracts

                  (C) Except as set forth in Part 2.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Acquired Corporations exclusively own all right, title
and interest to and in the Company IP (other than Intellectual Property Rights
or Intellectual Property licensed to the Company, as identified in Part
2.8(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or pursuant to license agreements
for non-customized third-party software that is generally available to the
public, for the scope of use currently exercised by such Acquired Corporation,
at a cost of less than $25,000) free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than
non-exclusive licenses granted by any Acquired Corporation in connection with
the sale or license of Company Products in the ordinary course of business).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Part
2.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

                           (i) all documents and instruments necessary to

         is Registered IP have been validly executed, delivered and filed in a
         timely manner with the appropriate Governmental Body;

                           (ii) each Company Associate who is or was involved in
         the creation or development of any Company IP, Company Product or

         Rights to, and a waiver of moral rights and other non-assignable
         Intellectual Property Rights in favor of, the appropriate Acquired
         Corporation; and (B) confidentiality provisions protecting the Company
         IP;

<PAGE>


                           (iii) no Company Associate has any claim, right
         (whether or not currently exercisable) or interest to or in any Company
         IP, including any claims under Germany's Act of Employee's Inventions
         or any similar Legal Requirement;

                           (iv) no funding, facilities or personnel of any
         Governmental Body or any university, college, research institute or
         other educational institution have been or are being, or are expected
         to be, used, directly or indirectly, to develop or create, in whole or
         in part, any Company IP, Company Product or Company Product Software,
         and no Company Associate who was involved in, or who contributed to,
         the creation or development of any Company IP performed services for
         any Governmental Body, university, college, research institute or other
         educational institution during a period of time during which such
         Company Associate was also performing services for any Acquired
         Corporation, except in each case for such funding, facilities,
         personnel or other involvements that have not resulted, and are not
         reasonably likely to result, in any material interference with or
         restriction on the Company's ability to use any of the Company IP or in
         any material right, claim or interest in any of the Company IP on the
         part of any Governmental Body or any other Person;

                           (v) each Acquired Corporation has taken reasonable
         steps to maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and
         enforce its rights in all material proprietary information held (or
         purported to be held) by any of the Acquired Corporations as a trade
         secret, including: (A) obtaining an appropriate binding non-disclosure
         agreement prior to disclosing to any third party (or permitting any
         third party to access) any trade secrets of any Acquired Corporation;
         and (B) imposing restrictions on unauthorized copying, unauthorized
         sale or transfer, recompilation, disassembly or reverse-engineering and
         other industry-standard restrictions on use prior to providing a third
         party with access to Company IP;

                           (vi) none of the Acquired Corporations is now or has
         ever been a member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry
         standards body or any similar organization that could reasonably be
         expected to require or obligate any of the Acquired Corporations to
         grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company
         IP; and

                           (vii) the Acquired Corporations own or otherwise
         have, and after the Closing the Surviving Corporation will continue to
         have, all Intellectual Property Rights needed to conduct the business
         of the Acquired Corporations as currently conducted and currently
         planned by the Company to be conducted without any additional
         expenditures or payments for such Intellectual Property Rights.

                  (D) All Company IP that is Registered IP (other than pending
applications) is, to the Knowledge of the Company, valid, subsisting and
enforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the Knowledge
of the Company and except as disclosed in Part 2.8(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule:

                                       15
<PAGE>

                           (i) all filings, payments and other actions required
         to be made or taken to maintain each item of Company IP that is
         Registered IP in full force and effect have been properly made and
         taken;

                           (ii) no application for a patent or for a copyright
         or trademark registration or any other type of Registered IP, in each
         case that is material to the business of any of the Acquired
         Corporations as currently conducted and currently planned by the
         Company to be conducted, and that has been filed by or on behalf of, or
         assigned to, any of the Acquired Corporations has been abandoned,
         allowed to lapse or rejected;

                           (iii) no interference, opposition, reissue,
         reexamination, cancellation or other Legal Proceeding of any nature is
         or has been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in
         which the scope, validity or enforceability of any Company IP that is
         Registered IP is being, has been or could reasonably be expected to be
         contested or challenged; and

                           (iv) to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
         basis for a non-frivolous claim that could reasonably be expected to
         result in a ruling, judgment or determination by any Governmental Body
         that any Company IP that is Registered IP that is material to the
         business of any of the Acquired Corporations as currently conducted and
         currently planned by the Company to be conducted is invalid or
         unenforceable.

                  (E) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions will, or could reasonably be expected to, with or
without notice or the lapse of time, result in or give any other Person the
right or option to cause, create, impose or declare: (i) a loss of, or
Encumbrance on, any Company IP; (ii) the release, disclosure, or delivery of any
Company IP by or to any escrow agent or other Person; or (iii) the grant,
assignment or transfer to any other Person of, or the right of any Person to
exercise, any license or other right or interest under, to or in any of the

otherwise), misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to
the Knowledge of the Company: (i) no Company Product, and no method or process
used in the development, manufacturing or servicing of any Company Product,
infringes, violates or makes unlawful use of any Intellectual Property Right of,
or contains any Intellectual Property misappropriated from, any other Person;
(ii) there is no legitimate basis for a claim that: (A) any Acquired Corporation
or any Company Product has infringed or misappropriated any Intellectual

                                       16

Property Right of another Person or engaged in unfair competition; or (B) any

Property misappropriated from, any other Person.

                  (H) The Company is not bound by any obligation to indemnify,
defend, hold harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to, and
otherwise has not assumed or agreed to discharge or otherwise take
responsibility for, any existing or potential infringement or misappropriation
of any Intellectual Property Rights, except for those express obligations
undertaken by the Company in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices to indemnify its customers for any infringement of Intellectual
Property Rights by the Company Products.

                  (I) No infringement, misappropriation or similar claim or
Legal Proceeding is or has been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened in writing against any Acquired Corporation or against any other
Person who is, or has asserted or could reasonably be expected to assert that it
is, entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed by any
Acquired Corporation with respect to such claim or Legal Proceeding (including
any claim or Legal Proceeding that has been settled, dismissed or otherwise
concluded).

                  (J) Since January 1, 2002, none of the Acquired Corporations
has received any written notice or other written communication relating to any
actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Intellectual Property Right of another Person by any of the Acquired
Corporations, the Company Products or the Company Product Software.

                  (K) To the Knowledge of the Company, no claim or Legal
Proceeding involving any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right
licensed to an Acquired Corporation is pending or has been threatened, except
for any such claim or Legal Proceeding that, if adversely determined, would not
adversely affect: (i) the use or exploitation of such Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Right by such Acquired Corporation; or (ii) the design,
development, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, provision, licensing, or
sale of any Company Product.

                  (L) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company
Product Software contains any bug, defect or error (including any bug, defect or
error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing,
storage, transmission or use of data) that materially and adversely affects the
use, functionality or performance of such Company Product Software or any
Company Product using, containing or including such Company Product Software.

                  (M) None of the Company Product Software is subject to any
"copyleft" or other obligation or condition (including any obligation or
condition under any "open source" license such as the GNU Public License, Lesser
GNU Public License or Mozilla Public License) that: (i) requires or could
reasonably be expected to require, or conditions or could reasonably be expected
to condition, the use, distribution or availability of such Company

                                       17
<PAGE>

Product Software on, the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any Company
Source Code for any portion of such Company Product Software; or (ii) otherwise
imposes or could reasonably be expected to impose any material limitation,
restriction or condition on the right or ability of the Company to use,
distribute or make available any Company Product Software.

                  (N) To the Knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in
Part 2.8(n) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Source Code has been
delivered, licensed or made available to any escrow agent or other Person (other
than employees of the Acquired Corporations), and none of the Acquired
Corporations has any duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or
otherwise) to deliver, license or make available any Company Source Code to any
escrow agent or other Person.

liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the date of this
Agreement in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities for Taxes incurred
since the date of the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet in the operation of the
business of the Acquired Corporations. The Company will establish, prior to the

limitation period applicable to any of the Acquired Corporation Returns has been
granted (by the Company or any other Person), and no such extension or waiver
has been requested from any Acquired Corporation.

                  (D) No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the

liens or other Encumbrances for material Taxes upon any of the assets of any of
the Acquired Corporations except liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable. None of the Acquired Corporations has been, and none of the Acquired
Corporations will be, required to include any adjustment in taxable income for

local or non-U.S. Tax Legal Requirements) as a result of transactions or events
occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing.

                  (E) No claim has ever been delivered by any Governmental Body
to an Acquired Corporation in a jurisdiction where an Acquired Corporation does
not file a Tax Return that it is or may be subject to taxation by that

any amount of Taxes of any other Person.

                  (G) No Acquired Corporation has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the meaning of
Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code. No Acquired Corporation is or has been a
United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code.

                  (H) No Acquired Corporation has been a member of an affiliated
group of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code or within
the meaning of any similar Legal Requirement to which an Acquired Corporation

                  (I) The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and complete

                  (L) None of the tax attributes (including net operating loss

and 1502 of the Code, are collectively referred to as the "Section 382 and
Related Provisions") for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. The

by the Company or used by the Company as set forth in Part 2.14(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Except for the Section 382 and Related Provisions,
the consummation of the Merger will not result in the loss of any favorable Tax

otherwise adversely affect the Surviving Corporation's Tax position after the
Closing Date.

                  (M) Each of the Acquired Corporations has withheld from each

the proper Governmental Bodies.

                  (N) The Acquired Corporations are in compliance with all
material transfer pricing requirements in all jurisdictions in which the

                  (G) Each of the Acquired Corporations and Company Affiliates
has performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed
by it under each Company Employee Plan, and each Company Employee Plan has been

Employee Plan (other than any Company Employee Plan to be terminated prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms,

threatened by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Body with respect to any Company Employee Plan. None of the
Acquired Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any
material penalty or tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section
502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material

Affiliates has made all contributions and other payments required by and due

after October 3, 2004.

                  (H) None of the Acquired Corporations, and no Company

been funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees'
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
None of the Acquired Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
Company Pension Plan in which stock of any of the Acquired Corporations or any
Company Affiliate is or was held as a plan asset. The fair market value of the
assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any
Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any
Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all
current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and no Contemplated
Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations. There are no liabilities of the Acquired Corporations
with respect to any Company Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and
reflected in the financial statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

                  (I) None of the Acquired Corporations, and no Company
Affiliate, maintains, sponsors or contributes to any Company Employee Plan that
is an employee welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) and that is, in whole or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No Company
Employee Plan provides (except at no cost to the Acquired Corporations or any
Company Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the
Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate to provide, post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any
reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal
Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any of
the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate, none of the Acquired
Corporations nor any Company Affiliate has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company Associate (either
individually or to Company Associates as a group) or any other Person that such
Company Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefit or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits, except to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

                  (J) Except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement
or as set forth in Part 2.15(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution of this

                                       29
<PAGE>

Agreement nor the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions could
reasonably be expected to (either alone or upon the occurrence of termination of
employment) constitute an event under any Company Employee Plan, Company
Employee Agreement, trust or loan that may result (either alone or in connection
with any other circumstance or event) in any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company
Associate.

                  (K) Each of the Acquired Corporations and Company Affiliates:
(i) is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all material respects with
all Legal Requirements respecting employment, terms and conditions of
employment, employment practices or other labor related matters, including
applicant and employee background checking, immigration laws, discrimination
laws, verification of employment eligibility, employee leave laws,
classification of Company Associates as employees and independent contractors,
classification of Company Associates as exempt or non-exempt, applicable wage
and hour laws, occupational safety and health laws; and (ii) has withheld and
reported all amounts required by applicable Legal Requirements or by Contract to
be withheld and reported with respect to wages, salaries and other payments to
Company Associates. No Acquired Corporation or Company Affiliate: (A) is liable
for any arrears of wages or any taxes or any interest or penalty for failure to
comply with the Legal Requirements applicable of the foregoing; or (B) is liable
for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on
behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security, social charges or other benefits or obligations for
Company Associates (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course
of business and consistent with past practices). Except as set forth in Part
2.15(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims or Legal
Proceedings against any of the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate
under any worker's compensation policy or long-term disability policy.

                  (L) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(l) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract
covering any Company Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made
to any Company Associate, that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or could
reasonably be expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or indirectly to
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section
162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision under U.S. state or local or
non-U.S. Tax Legal Requirements). No Acquired Corporation is a party to or has
any obligation under any Contract to compensate any Person for excise taxes
payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or for additional taxes payable
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

                  (M) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Associate is
obligated under any Contract or subject to any Order of any court or other
Governmental Body that would interfere with such Company Associate's efforts to
promote the interests of the Acquired Corporations or that would interfere with
the businesses of the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate. To the
Knowledge of the Company, neither: (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement; nor (ii) the carrying on of the business of any Acquired Corporation

                                       30
<PAGE>

or any Company Affiliate as presently conducted or any activity of any Company
Associate in connection with the carrying on of the business of any Acquired
Corporation or any Company Affiliate as currently conducted, will or could
reasonably be expected to, to the Knowledge of the Company, conflict with,
result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of or constitute a
default under any Contract by which any such Company Associate is now bound.

                  (N) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(n) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since January 1, 2003, none of the Acquired Corporations
has effectuated a "plant closing," partial "plant closing," "relocation", "mass
layoff" or "termination" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any similar Legal Requirement) affecting any site of
employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of
employment or facility of any of the Acquired Corporations.

                  (O) Part 2.15(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
identifies each option re-pricing or option exchange program undertaken by any
Acquired Corporation. Each option re-pricing or exchange program identified in
Part 2.15(o) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) was effected in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable Contracts; and (ii) has been
accurately reflected in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents.

                  (P) Part 2.15(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each loan or other advance made by any of the Acquired Corporations to any
Company Associate since January 1, 2003 or that is currently outstanding, other
than routine travel advances made to employees in the ordinary course of
business.

                  (Q) Part 2.15(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
an accurate and complete list of all employees (including directors and officers
(Geschaeftsfuehrer und leitende Angestellte)) of the Acquired Corporations
(without names) who reside or work in Germany as of the date of this Agreement
(such employees, together with the consultants and freelancers referred to below
in this Section, the "German Employees"), together in each case with the
following information with respect to such employees: (i) current position; (ii)
total current annual compensation (including bonus for which such German
Employee is eligible); (iii) outstanding promises of additional remuneration
(other than remuneration payable pursuant to Legal Requirements in Germany); and
(iv) years of service. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and complete
copies of all types of standard employment agreements (including consultant and
freelance agreements) in relation to the German Employees or copies of actual
employment agreements if no such standard employment agreement is used (or if a
standard employment agreement that deviates in any material respect from such
standard employment agreement is used) or a description of the terms of
employment if there exists no written employment agreement. Except as set forth
in Part 2.15(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (A) all obligations and
liabilities of the Acquired Corporations to provide pensions and pension
benefits to all German Employees pursuant to German Legal Requirements, practice
or otherwise are accrued on the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet in accordance
with GAAP; and (B) there are no unwritten policies, practices or customs of the
Acquired Corporations that are not accrued for in the Unaudited Interim Balance
Sheet and, by extension, could reasonably be expected to entitle the German
Employees in general to benefits in addition to what such German Employees are
entitled to by applicable Legal Requirements or under the terms of such German

                                       31
<PAGE>

Employees' employment Contracts (including unwritten customs or practices
concerning the payment of severance pay when it is not required under applicable
Legal Requirements). For purposes of this Agreement (other than the first full
sentence of this Section 2.15(q)), the term "German Employee" shall be construed
to include consultants and freelancers who devote a majority of their working
time in Germany to the business of an Acquired Corporation or, due to the
circumstances of their engagement, could otherwise be reasonably deemed to be
subject to German Legal Requirements with respect to labor matters (excluding
any external temporary workers).

         2.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (A) Each of the Acquired Corporations: (i) is and has been in

material violation of or subject to any material liability under, any applicable
Environmental Laws; and (ii) possesses all permits and other Governmental
Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and is in

                  (B) Since January 1, 2003, none of the Acquired Corporations

the Acquired Corporations is not or might not be in compliance with any
Environmental Law, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the compliance by any of the
Acquired Corporations with any Environmental Law in the future.

                  (C) Except as set forth in Part 2.16(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (and except as would not, and could not reasonably be
expected to, result in a material liability or obligation of any Acquired
Corporation, including any material remediation): (i) all Company Real Property
and any other property that is or was leased to or controlled or used by any of
the Acquired Corporations, and all surface water, groundwater and soil
associated with or adjacent to such property, is free of proscribed levels of
any Materials of Environmental Concern (as defined in Section 2.16(f)) or
material environmental contamination of any nature; (ii) none of the Company
Real Property or any other property that is or was leased to or controlled or
used by any of the Acquired Corporations contains any underground storage tanks,
asbestos, equipment using PCBs or underground injection wells; and (iii) none of
the Company Real Property or any other property that is or was leased to or

all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws.

                  (E) No Acquired Corporation has ever sent or transported, or
arranged to send or transport, any Materials of Environmental Concern to a site
that, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law: (i) has been placed on the
"National Priorities List" of hazardous waste sites or any similar U.S. state or
local or non-U.S. list; (ii) is otherwise designated or identified as a
potential site for remediation, cleanup, closure or other environmental remedial

                                       32
<PAGE>

activity; or (iii) is subject to a Legal Requirement to take "removal" or
"remedial" action as detailed in any applicable Environmental Law or to make
payment for the cost of cleaning up any site.

                  (F) For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "Environmental Law"
means any Legal Requirement relating to pollution or protection of human health
or the environment (including ambient air, surface water, ground water, land
surface or subsurface strata), including any Legal Requirement relating to
emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of Materials of
Environmental Concern, or otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing,
distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of

material insurance policies and material self-insurance programs or arrangements
relating to the business, assets or operations of any of the Acquired
Corporations. Each of such insurance policies, programs and arrangements is in
full force and effect. None of the Acquired Corporations has received any notice
or other communication regarding any actual or possible: (a) cancellation or
invalidation of any insurance policy; (b) refusal of any coverage or rejection
of any material claim under any insurance policy; or (c) material adjustment in
the amount of the premiums payable with respect to any insurance policy. There
is no pending workers' compensation or other claim under or based upon any
insurance policy of any of the Acquired Corporations involving an amount in
excess of $50,000 in any individual case or $100,000 in the aggregate. With
respect to each claim or Legal Proceeding that has been asserted or filed
against any Acquired Corporation, the Company has provided written notice of
such claim or Legal Proceeding to the appropriate insurance carrier(s), if any,
and no such carrier has issued a denial of coverage or a reservation of rights
with respect to any such claim or Legal Proceeding, or informed any Acquired
Corporation of its intent to do so.

         2.18 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. Except as set forth in the Company
SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, during the
period commencing on the date of the Company's last proxy statement filed with
the SEC through the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred and no
circumstance has existed that would be required to be reported by the Company
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

         2.19 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS; ORDERS.

                  (A) Part 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies

Proceeding that any Person has threatened in writing to commence: (i) that
involves: (A) any of the Acquired Corporations; (B) any business or securities
of any of the Acquired Corporations; (C) any of the assets owned, leased or used

<PAGE>

omission on the part of any director or officer of any Acquired Corporation in
his or her capacity as such; or (ii) that challenges, or that may have the
effect of preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with,
the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred, and no claim, dispute or other condition or
circumstance exists, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve
as a basis for the commencement of any Legal Proceeding of the type described in
clause "(i)" or clause "(ii)" of the first sentence of this Section 2.19(a).

                  (B) There is no Order to which any of the Acquired
Corporations, or any of the assets owned or used by any of the Acquired
Corporations, is subject. To the Knowledge of the Company, no officer or other
key employee of any of the Acquired Corporations is subject to any Order that
prohibits such officer or other employee from engaging in or continuing any
conduct, activity or practice relating to the business of any of the Acquired
Corporations.

         2.20 AUTHORITY; INAPPLICABILITY OF ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES; BINDING
NATURE OF AGREEMENT. The Company has the corporate right, power and authority to
enter into and to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The board of
directors of the Company (at a meeting duly called and held) has: (a)
unanimously determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its shareholders; (b) unanimously authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to: (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors; and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other

<PAGE>


                  (A) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of: (i)
any of the provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company

                  (B) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any
Legal Requirement or any Order to which any of the Acquired Corporations, or any

                  (E) result in the imposition or creation of any Encumbrance
upon or with respect to any asset owned or used by any of the Acquired
Corporations (except for minor liens that will not, in any case or in the
aggregate, materially detract from the value of the assets subject thereto or
materially impair the operations of any of the Acquired Corporations); or

                  (F) result in, or increase the likelihood of, the disclosure
or delivery to any escrowholder or other Person of any Company IP, or the
transfer of any material asset of any of the Acquired Corporations to any
Person.

Except as may be required by the Exchange Act, the CBCA, the CCAA, the HSR Act,
any non-U.S. Antitrust Law, and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National
Market (as they relate to the Proxy Statement), none of the Acquired
Corporations was, is or will be required to make any filing with or give any
notice to, or to obtain any Consent from, any Person in connection with: (x) the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement; or (y) the consummation of
the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

         2.23 FAIRNESS OPINION. The Company's board of directors has received
the written opinion of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. ("Citigroup"), financial

Corporations. The total of all fees, commissions and other amounts that have
been paid by the Company to Citigroup and its affiliates and all fees,
commissions and other amounts that may become payable to Citigroup and its
affiliates by the Acquired Corporations if the Merger is consummated will not
exceed the amount set forth in Part 2.24 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The

the shareholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Shareholders'
Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except
that the Company makes no representation as to the accuracy of information, if
any, provided by Parent to be incorporated in the Proxy Statement.

         3.3 BINDING NATURE OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due

to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.


     SECTION 4. CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

         4.1 ACCESS AND INVESTIGATION. During the period commencing on the date
of this Agreement and ending as of the earlier of the Effective Time and the
valid termination of this Agreement (the "Pre-Closing Period"), the Company
shall, and the Company shall cause the respective Representatives of the
Acquired Corporations to: (a) provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with
reasonable access to the Acquired Corporations' Representatives, personnel and
assets and to all existing books, records, Tax Returns, work papers and other
documents and information relating to the Acquired Corporations; and (b) provide
Parent and Parent's Representatives with such copies of the existing books,
records, Tax Returns, work papers and other documents and information relating

senior officers to meet, upon reasonable notice and during normal business
hours, with the chief financial officer and other officers of the Company
responsible for the Company's financial statements and the internal controls of
the Acquired Corporations to discuss such matters as Parent may deem necessary
or appropriate in order to enable Parent, after the Closing, to satisfy its
obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations relating
thereto. Without limiting the generality of any of the foregoing, during the
Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of:
(i) all material operating and financial reports prepared by the Acquired

or communications sent by or on behalf of the Company to its shareholders; (iii)
any material written notice, document or other communication (or any material
oral notice or other communication sent or received by any employee of any

any communication that relates solely to routine commercial transactions and
that is of the type sent in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices) sent by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations to any
party to any Significant Contract or sent to any of the Acquired Corporations by
any party to any Significant Contract; (iv) any notice, report or other document
filed with or sent to any

                                       37
<PAGE>

Governmental Body on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations in connection
with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and (v) any

directly or indirectly, and the Company shall ensure that its Subsidiaries and
the respective directors, officers and financial advisors of the Acquired

that the other Representatives of the Acquired Corporations do not, which
reasonable efforts shall include using its best efforts to cause the following
actions to cease after any member of the executive team of any Acquired
Corporation becomes aware of such action), directly or indirectly:

                           (i) solicit, initiate, induce, facilitate or
         encourage the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition
         Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or take any action that could

         Acquisition Inquiry;

                           (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding any
         of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in connection with or in
         response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;


                           (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
         Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry;

                           (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
         Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or

                           (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar
         document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any
         Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement of the
         type described in, and only if in accordance with, the proviso below in
         this Section 4.3(a));

provided, however, that prior to the approval of this Agreement by the Required
Company Shareholder Vote, this Section 4.3(a) shall not prohibit the Company
from: (A) furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Acquired Corporations
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to
an Acquisition Proposal submitted to the Company by such Person (and not
withdrawn) that is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Offer by such
Person; or (B) withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation and/or
endorsing or recommending any Acquisition Proposal, in any case under clause
"(A)" or "(B)" of this proviso if: (1) neither the Company nor any
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall have breached or taken
any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in this Section
4.3; (2) the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is required in
order for the board of directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable law; (3) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the
identity of such Person and of the Company's intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or


                                       42

<PAGE>

enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary provisions; (4) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to
such Person, the Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by the
Company to Parent); and (5) prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board
Recommendation and/or endorsing or recommending any Acquisition Proposal, the
Company complies with Section 5.2(c) and notifies Parent in writing that it
intends to so withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation and/or endorse
or recommend such Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall ensure that no director, officer or financial
advisor of any of the Acquired Corporations (and the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to ensure that no other Representatives of any of the
Acquired Corporations) takes any action inconsistent with any of the provisions
set forth in the preceding sentence, and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any director, officer or financial advisor of any of the
Acquired Corporations, whether or not such director, officer or financial
advisor is purporting to act on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations, and
any action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any other Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations if the
Company has not used reasonable efforts to ensure that such Representative not
to take such action, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 4.3
by the Company.

                  (B) If any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry is made
or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Company shall
promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent orally and in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
and the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to:
(i) the status of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii)
the status and terms of any modification or proposed modification thereto.

                  (C) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

                  (D) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of
any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any
confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire or similar Contract to which any of
the Acquired Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired
Corporations has any rights, and will cause each such agreement to be enforced
to the extent requested by Parent. The Company also shall promptly request each
Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar agreement in connection
with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or a possible
equity investment in any Acquired Corporation to return to the Acquired
Corporations all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations.

hereafter referred to as "Assumed Options"). All rights to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock under Assumed Options shall thereupon be converted into
rights to purchase Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Option may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each Assumed Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were subject to such Assumed Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio (as defined below in this
Section), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be determined
by dividing the per share exercise price of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to
the nearest whole cent; and (D) any restriction on the exercise of any Assumed
Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Assumed Option shall otherwise
remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Assumed
Option; provided, however, that: (1) each Assumed Option shall, in accordance
with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of
bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Parent Common
Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; and (2) Parent's board of directors or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company's board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each
Assumed Option. For the purpose of this Section 5.3(a), the "Conversion Ratio"
shall mean the fraction (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) having a numerator
equal to the Merger Consideration and having a denominator equal to the average
closing price of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ National Market
for the period of ten consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the
second trading day prior to the Closing Date (adjusted to the extent appropriate
to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to
Parent Common Stock).

                  (B) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than the Filing
Date (as defined below in this section), a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Assumed Options eligible
for registration on Form S-8. For purposes of this Section 5.3(b), "Filing Date"
shall mean the later of: (i) 10 business days after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs; or (ii) 10 business days after the date on which the
Company provides to Parent all information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the filing of the Form S-8 and the integration of the employees
of the Company into Parent's stock option exercise program, including
information with respect to the number of outstanding options and the exercise
prices thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent or its Representatives the
information set forth in clause "(ii)" of the preceding sentence and to
otherwise cooperate with Parent and its


                                       46

<PAGE>

Representative in connection with the filing of the Form S-8 and the integration
of the employees of the Company into Parent's stock option exercise program
promptly following a request by Parent.

                  (C) At the Effective Time, Parent may (but shall not be
obligated to) assume any or all of the Company Option Plans or merge any of such
Company Option Plans into any stock option plan of Parent. If Parent elects to
so assume or merge any Company Option Plan, then, under such Company Option
Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible
under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company
Option Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares subsequently returned
to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Assumed Options),
except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common
Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Option Plan to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced
shares of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the
resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock; and (iii) Parent's board of directors or a committee thereof shall
succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company's board of directors
or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company
Option Plan.

                  (D) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Award that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become a stock award of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall
either: (i) assume such Company Stock Award converted as provided above; or (ii)
replace such Company Stock Award by issuing a reasonably equivalent replacement
stock award of Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case,
subject to the remainder of this Section 5.3(d), in accordance with the same
terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company
Option Plan and the same terms of the stock award agreement by which such
Company Stock Award is evidenced, except as such terms may be modified pursuant
to a mutual agreement between Parent and the holder of such Company Stock Award
(all Company Stock Awards that are assumed or replaced pursuant to this Section
5.3(d) are hereafter referred to as "Assumed Stock Awards"). All rights to
receive shares of Company Common Stock under Assumed Stock Awards shall
thereupon be converted into rights to receive Parent Common Stock. Accordingly,
from and after the Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Stock Award will be a stock
award solely for the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed Stock Award
shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were subject to such Assumed Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (C) any restriction
on the exercise of any Assumed Stock Award shall continue in full force and
effect and the vesting schedule and other terms and provisions of such Assumed
Stock Award shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or
replacement of such Assumed Stock Award; provided, however, that: (1) each
Assumed Stock Award shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction with respect to Parent Common Stock subsequent to the Effective
Time; and (2) Parent's board of directors or a

                                       47

<PAGE>


committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Company's board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each
Assumed Stock Award.

                  (E) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action that may be necessary (under the Company Option Plans and otherwise),
including the issuance to the holders of Company Stock Awards of an assumption
confirmation notice, to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.3 and to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Options or
Company Stock Awards have no rights with respect thereto other than those
specifically provided in this Section 5.3.

                  (F) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action that may be necessary to cause all participants' rights under all current
offering periods under the Company's ESPP to terminate on or prior to the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, and on such date all accumulated payroll
deductions allocated to each participant's account under the ESPP shall
thereupon be returned to each participant as provided by the terms of the ESPP
and no shares of Company Common Stock shall be purchased under the ESPP for such
final offering period. As of the close of business on the day immediately prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall have terminated the ESPP after having
provided the notice of such termination as required by the terms of the ESPP.
The form and substance of the notice regarding the ESPP termination shall be
subject to the review and approval of Parent.

         5.4 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (A) Effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, each of the Acquired Corporations and Company
Affiliates shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each an "Acquired Corporation 401(k)
Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that any such
Acquired Corporation 401(k) Plan(s) shall not be terminated). Unless Parent
provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Acquired Corporation 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of
no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the board of directors of the Company, any Acquired Corporation
or Company Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Acquired Corporation 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably request.

                  (B) To the extent any employee notification or consultation
requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of
the Contemplated Transactions, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure
that such requirements are complied with prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of the other Acquired
Corporations shall communicate with any employees of any of the Acquired
Corporations regarding post-Closing employment matters, including post-Closing
employee benefits and compensation, without the prior approval of Parent unless
such communication is made in accordance with the terms of a written plan
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company prior to such communication (it
being understood that it shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.4(b) for an Acquired Corporation to communicate with

                                       48

<PAGE>

an employee of such Acquired Corporation who contacts such Acquired Corporation
to discuss an offer proposed by, or other statement made by, Parent as long as
such communication is limited to a discussion of such offer or statement).

         5.5 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

                  (A) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in
favor of those Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the
date of this Agreement (the "Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions
as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective Time,
as provided in the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws (as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any indemnification
agreements between the Company and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement) identified in Part 2.9(a)(vi) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and be observed by the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent available under Colorado law for a period of
six years from the date on which the Merger becomes effective, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to so observe such rights (including, to the
extent necessary, by providing funds to ensure such observance).

                  (B) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to
their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring
prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement
in the form delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Existing D&O Policy"), to the extent that directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage is commercially available; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing D&O
Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage or a "tail" policy with
comparable coverage.

         5.6 REGULATORY APPROVALS; ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS.

                  (A) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
file, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices,
reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with any
Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any
such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and

and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable to: (i) any inquiries or
requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice
for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests
received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters.

                  (B) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the
Nondisclosure Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the
other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate any
filings (including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) Section 5.6(a). Except where prohibited by

                                       49

<PAGE>

applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, and subject to the
confidentiality provisions of the Nondisclosure Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall: (i) consult with the other prior to taking a position with
respect to any such filing; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any Legal Proceeding related solely to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (including any such Legal Proceeding relating to any
Antitrust Law); (iii) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such
information; and (iv) promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white
papers, opinions, proposals and other submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental Body
related solely to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

                  (C) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other
promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any
Governmental Body in connection with any filing made pursuant to this Agreement;
(ii) Knowledge of the commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or any
of the other Contemplated Transactions (and shall keep the other party informed
as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request
by any official of any Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to comply
with any Legal Requirements applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section
5.6(a), Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall (promptly upon learning
of the occurrence of such event) inform the other of the occurrence of such
event and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Body such
amendment or supplement.

                  (D) Subject to Section 5.6(e), Parent and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
Section 5.6(e), each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if
any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party
in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions; (ii)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any)
required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or
Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger.

                  (E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to divest or agree to divest (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations to divest or
agree to divest) any of its respective businesses, product lines or assets, or
to take or agree to take (or cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Acquired Corporations to take or agree to take) any other action or agree (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations to agree) to
any limitation or restriction on any of its

                                       50

<PAGE>


respective businesses, product lines or assets; or (ii) to contest any Legal
Proceeding relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

         5.7 DISCLOSURE. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of the Acquired Corporations or any
Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations to, make any disclosure to
the public regarding the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
unless: (a) Parent shall have approved such disclosure (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld); or (b) the Company shall have been advised by its
outside legal counsel that such disclosure is required by applicable law and
shall have provided Parent with reasonable advance notice of the Company's
intention to make such disclosure and the content of such disclosure; provided,
however, that the Company is permitted to make disclosure to the public
regarding the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions in accordance
with the terms of the press release and the analyst scripts previously approved
by Parent.

         5.8 RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing
the resignation of each director of each of the Acquired Corporations, which
resignation shall be effective upon the Effective Time.


         5.9 INTERNAL CONTROLS. If, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company
or the Company's auditors identify any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses (or a series of control deficiencies that collectively are deemed to
constitute a significant deficiency or a material weakness) in the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, then the Company
shall notify Parent as promptly thereafter as practicable and shall use its
reasonable best efforts during the Pre-Closing Period to rectify such
significant deficiency or material weakness, as the case may be.


         5.10 PARENT APPROVAL. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement by
the parties hereto, Parent, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve
this Agreement and the Merger and provide written confirmation thereof to the
Company.

material respects as of such date); provided, however, that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of the Specified Representations as of the foregoing

to be obtained with respect to the Merger under any applicable Antitrust Law

representations and warranties for purposes of clause "(ii)" of this proviso),
all "materiality" qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded; and (ii) any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties will be disregarded if all circumstances

Company Shareholder Vote):

                  (A) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

                  (B) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not
have been consummated by September 30, 2006; provided, however, that: (i) a
party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

to the Effective Time; and (ii) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) unless the Company shall have
made any payment required to be made to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

                  (C) by Parent or the Company if a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and

however, that: (A) a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement

this Section

                                       55

inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on
such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) would
not be satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the

or as of any subsequent date, and for purposes of determining the accuracy of
the Other Company Representations for purposes of clause "(ii)" of the proviso
to Section 6.1(b): (A) all "Company Material Adverse Effect" and other
"materiality" qualifications limiting the scope of the Other Company
Representations or limiting the scope of the defined terms used in the Other

been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) would not be
satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of the Company's
representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by the Company is curable by
the Company and the Company is continuing to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(f) on account of such inaccuracy or breach
unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days
commencing on the date that Parent gives the Company written notice of such
inaccuracy or breach;

                  (G) by the Company if: (i) any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 shall have
been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such

limiting the scope of such other representations and warranties shall be
disregarded; or (iii) any of Parent's covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section
7.2 would not be satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of
Parent's representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of
this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent is curable by
Parent and Parent is continuing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(g) on account of such inaccuracy or breach
unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days
commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent written notice of such
inaccuracy or breach; or

                  (H) by the Company (at any time prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Required Company Shareholder Vote), in order to accept a
Superior Offer and enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement (as
defined below) relating to such Superior Offer, if: (i) there shall not have
been any breach in any material respect of any obligations contained in Section

Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement as an attachment) containing the
Company's representation and warranty that: (A) the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement has been duly executed and delivered to the Company by the
other party thereto and the offer thereby made by such other party cannot be
withdrawn by such other party at any time during the period of two days
commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of such notice; (B) the board of
directors of the Company has authorized the execution and delivery of the
Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement on behalf of the Company and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h); and (C) the

contemporaneously with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(h); (iv) a period of at least three business days shall have elapsed
since the receipt by Parent of such notice, and the Company shall have made its
Representatives available during such period for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent regarding a possible amendment to this Agreement or a
possible alternative transaction; (v) the Company shall have promptly advised
Parent of any modification proposed to be made to the Specified Definitive
Acquisition Agreement by the other party thereto; (vi) any written proposal by
Parent to amend this Agreement or enter into an alternative transaction shall
have been considered by the board of directors of the Company in good faith, and
such board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after having
obtained and taken into account a written opinion of an independent financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that the terms of the proposed
amendment to this Agreement (or other alternative transaction) are not as
favorable to the Company's shareholders, from a financial point of view, as the
terms of the transaction contemplated by the Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement


                                       57

<PAGE>

full force and effect; (b) the Nondisclosure Agreement shall survive the

the Company had (or would be reasonably expected to have) a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and (B) in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, had (or would
reasonably be expected to have) a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger; or (ii) any breach of any

approval of the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

         9.2 WAIVER. No failure on the part of any party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy. No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising

facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind
the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         9.5 APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be governed by,

the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that neither this Agreement nor any party's rights or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by such party without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any attempted assignment or delegation of this
Agreement or any of such rights or obligations by a party without the other
party's prior written consent shall be void and of no effect. Except as

making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
