Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof:

  

  

 (a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ , _Section 2.02(c)_ or _Section 2.04_ , each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (x) $11.80 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (y) 0.1612 shares of Parent Stock (subject to _Section 2.03_ and _Section 2.09_ ) (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each such share shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect to the Stock Consideration, the right to receive (i) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and (ii) any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ , in each case, to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.03_ , without interest; 

  

 (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; 

  

 (c) each share of Company Stock held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and 

  

 (d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and, together with any shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued pursuant to _Section 2.02(c)_ , shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

       

    Section 2.03. _ Surrender and Payment. _ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint its transfer agent or another agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (A) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (in a form that was reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time) and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 2.07_ ), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, in the case of Certificates, or (ii) receipt of such evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request in the case of a surrender of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ). Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Stock and for exchange in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ , (x) certificates (or evidence of shares of Parent Stock in book-entry form) representing the shares of Parent Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock and (y) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_ (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) (such cash and shares of Parent Stock, collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time, as needed, additional cash or other securities or assets sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ , which amounts shall become part of the Exchange Fund. The cash in the Exchange Fund may, pending its disbursement to the holders of Company Stock, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or losses shall affect the amounts payable to such holders of Company Stock and Parent shall promptly replace or cause to be replaced any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent that are lost through any investment so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay the aggregate cash Merger Consideration (and the aggregate amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ). Earnings from investments, subject to the immediately preceding proviso, shall be paid to and shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent. Except as contemplated by _Section 2.03(e)_ hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

  

      

  

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes or fees required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former holders of shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such former holder of shares of Company Stock who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares of Company Stock without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.04_ in respect of any Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall promptly deposit with the Exchange Agent any funds, assets or securities (including Parent Stock) necessary to provide for payment of the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h) _ ) with respect to any Appraisal Shares that lose their status as such. 

  

 (g) The shares of Parent Stock constituting the Stock Consideration shall be issued in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is otherwise required under Applicable Law or requested by a holder of shares of Company Stock. 

   

 (h) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Stock with respect to shares of Parent Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such share of Company Stock until such holder shall surrender such share of Company Stock in accordance with this _Article 2_. After the surrender of any such share of Company Stock in accordance with this _Article 2_ , such holder thereof that is entitled to receive shares of Parent Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall then be entitled to receive, and Parent shall then cause to be paid to such Person, any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, with a record date on or after the Effective Time and which theretofore had become 

  

      

  

payable (whether or not prior to such surrender) with respect to whole shares
of Parent Stock issuable to such holder in respect of such shares of Parent
Stock.

  

  

    Section 2.04. _ Appraisal Shares. _ Notwithstanding
_Section 2.02_ , shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Stock canceled in
accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_ ) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect of such shares in
accordance with the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Appraisal Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\'s appraisal rights under the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead the holders thereof shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto other than the right to payment of the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with the DGCL; _provided_ that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder\'s right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such
shares of Company Stock shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to participate in all substantive discussions with Third
Parties, negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or voluntarily offer to settle or settle,
any such demands prior to the Effective Time.

  

    Section 2.05. _ Company Equity Awards_.  

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per share of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Exercise Price_ ") that is less than the Merger Consideration Value (each such Company Stock Option, an " _In-the-Money Company Stock Option_ "), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such In-the-Money Company Stock Option (the " _In-the-Money Company Option Merger Consideration_ "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the In-the-Money Company Option Merger Consideration to the holder of the applicable In-the-Money Company Stock Option at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time). At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is not an In-the-Money Company Stock Option, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor. As used herein, " _Merger Consideration Value_ " means the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration, and (y) the product obtained by multiplying the Stock Consideration by the Parent Stock Price. 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions under any Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) in accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_ and under the same terms and conditions as apply to the receipt of the Merger Consideration by holders of Company Stock generally. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan which vest solely based on the satisfaction of time-based criteria (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) in respect of each share of Company Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company RSU Merger Consideration_ "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company RSU Merger Consideration to the holder of the applicable Company RSU at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company RSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan which vest in whole or in part based on the satisfaction of performance-based criteria (each, a " _Company PSU"_ ) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled without any action on the part of any holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.09_ and dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.03(h)_ ) in respect of each share of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company PSU Merger Consideration_ "); _provided_ , in the case of a Company PSU subject to unsatisfied performance conditions for a performance period that includes the date on which the Effective Time occurs, for purposes of calculating the payments provided for by this _Section 2.05(d)_ , the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company PSU shall be determined as though such performance conditions were satisfied at the applicable target level of performance. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company PSU Merger Consideration to the holder of the applicable Company PSU at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company PSU which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, each award of stock appreciation rights granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company SAR_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and has a per share strike price that is less than the Merger Consideration Value (each such Company SAR, an " _In-the-Money Company SAR_ ") whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess of the Merger Consideration Value over the per share strike price of such In-the-Money Company SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the " _In-the-Money Company SAR Merger Consideration_ "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the In-the-Money Company SAR Merger Consideration to the holder of the applicable In-the-Money Company SAR at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time). At the Effective Time, each Company SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not an In-the-Money 

  

      

  

Company SAR, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company
SAR which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred
compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the
earliest possible date that such payment would not trigger a tax or penalty
under Section 409A of the Code.

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, _Section 2.05(a)_ through _Section 2.05(e)_ hereof shall not apply to any Company Equity Award granted pursuant to _Section 6.01(k)_ after the date hereof, and each such Company Equity Award shall instead be treated in accordance with _Section 6.01(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting, providing for the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.05_  and _Section 6.01(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company shall provide that, following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company RSU, Company PSU or Company SAR (other than any Company Equity Award described in _Section 2.05(f)_ ) shall have the right to acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in respect thereof (other than, in the case of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and Company PSUs, the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to, and subject to the conditions of, this Agreement). 

  

  

    Section 2.06. _ Withholding Rights. _ Each of the Exchange
Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_ such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law; _provided_ , that
withholding with respect to any Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company PSU shall be taken first from the
Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company
PSU, as applicable, and then, to the extent necessary, the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Stock Option, Company
Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company PSU, as applicable, in the form of
Stock Consideration. If the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, withholds any such
amounts and properly pays such amounts over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such withholding was made.

  

    Section 2.07. _ Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article 2_.

  

    Section 2.08. _ Adjustments. _ If, during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
number or type of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company or
Parent Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including reverse split) or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement, and similarly dependent items as the case may be, shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to

        

such event. Nothing in this _Section 2.08_ shall be construed to permit any
party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by
any other provision of this Agreement.

  

    Section 2.09. _ No Fractional Shares. _ Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a
fractional share of Parent Stock shall be issued in the Merger, including
pursuant to _Section 2.05(b)_. Each holder of shares of Company Stock or
Company Equity Awards who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of
a share of Parent Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Stock
or Company Equity Awards owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be
converted into Parent Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_ , aggregated
together and all calculations rounded to three (3) decimal places) shall be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.09_ or otherwise in case of Company Equity
Awards, in lieu of such fractional share, an amount of cash (rounded down to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Stock to which
such holder would, but for this _Section 2.09_ , be entitled under this
Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price. The parties acknowledge
that payment of cash in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip for a
fractional share was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that otherwise would be caused by the issuance of a
fractional share. No such holder of a fractional share interest shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

    Section 3.01. _ Certificate of Incorporation. _ The

_Section 7.04_.

  

    Section 3.03. _ Directors and Officers. _ The parties

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

    
ARTICLE 4 
Representations and Warranties of the Company 

  

 Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC by the Company on or after January 1, 2018, and at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or any similar disclosure to the extent that such statements are predictive, precautionary or forward-looking statements but, for purpose of clarification, including and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any such statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SEC\'s Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (" _EDGAR_ ") or (ii) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter expressly referenced therein (it being understood and agreed that, other than with respect to _Section 4.01_ , _Section 4.02_ and 

        

 _Section 4.05_ , any information set forth in one section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other
section and subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is
reasonably apparent from the text of the disclosure), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:

  

    Section 4.01. _ Corporate Existence and Power. _ 

  

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and authority required to carry on its business as currently conducted and to own, lease and operate its properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and assets are currently operated, except for such power and authority the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to be material. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and (where applicable and recognized) is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or licensed has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

 (b) Complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been made available to Parent and are in full force and effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof. 

  

  

    Section 4.02. _ Corporate Authorization. _ 

  

  

 (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (subject to the receipt of the required approval of the Company\'s stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger) and are within the Company\'s corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Company\'s stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, no other corporate action or proceeding on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming the representations and warranties in _Section 5.17(b)_ are complete and correct, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger is the only vote of the holders of securities of the Company necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors\' rights generally and general principles of equity). 

  

 (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company\'s Board of Directors has, by resolutions unanimously adopted by the Company\'s Board of Directors, (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Company\'s stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and (iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at the Company Stockholder Meeting and (iv) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation in the preceding clause (iv), the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the aforesaid actions by the Company\'s Board of Directors has been amended, rescinded or modified. 

  

      

                                    

    

    Section 4.03. _ Governmental Authorization. _ Neither the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require
any Consent of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or
filing with or notice to, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do
business, (b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Applicable Law of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States (" _Foreign Antitrust Laws_ "), (c)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and
any other applicable state or federal securities laws (including the filing
with the SEC of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), (d) compliance with any
applicable rules of the NYSE and (e) any actions or filings the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
(A) be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (B)
prevent the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger.

  

    Section 4.04. _ Non-contravention. _ Neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, will (a)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of any Subsidiary of the Company (each as amended), (b) assuming
that the Consents, registrations, declarations, filings and notices referred
to in _Section 4.03_ have been obtained or made and assuming the
representations and warranties in _Section 5.17(b)_ are complete and correct,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Applicable Law or (c) require any consent or other action by any
Person under, violate, conflict with or result in any breach of any provision

the Company\'s Board of Directors, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement, that the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The Company shall notify

not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person with
respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (jointly and severally) shall indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent that the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary would be permitted to do so by Delaware law or, if any such Company Subsidiary is not organized in Delaware, the Applicable Law of organization of such Company Subsidiary, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) with respect to the present and former directors and officers of the Company that are Indemnified Persons, (A) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (B) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) with respect to the Indemnified Persons set forth on _Section 7.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director of any Company Subsidiary and his or her respective actions or omissions in his or her capacity as a director of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case whether asserted or arising before, on or after the Effective Time, against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person (to the extent required or, in the case of advancement, permitted by Delaware law, upon delivery to the Parent of an unsecured, interest-free undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified)) and all judgments, fines and, subject to the remainder of this _Section 7.04(b)_ , amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Person is indemnified hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent or its applicable Subsidiary may, at its option and expense, assume and control the defense of any Claim with one counsel for all similarly situated Indemnified Persons subject to such Claim, if such counsel reasonably acceptable to a majority of the Indemnified Persons who may be entitled to indemnification for such Claim; _provided that_ , if such Claim commenced after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and relates to this Agreement, the Merger or the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company, then at the election of a majority of such Indemnified Persons, such counsel shall be the counsel of record prior to the Effective Time for such Claim; _provided further_ that any Indemnified Person may fully participate at its own expense in the defense of such Claim through separate counsel of its own choosing; and _provided further_ that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel of any Indemnified Person, there is a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Person and Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, or because of Parent or its applicable Subsidiary\'s failure to defend for a period of sixty (60) days any such Claim, any such Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel of its own choosing to participate in the defense of such Claim on its behalf, and the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) of defending such Claim shall be indemnified by Parent and the Surviving Company to the extent otherwise indemnifiable 

  

      

  

hereunder. If the Parent or its applicable Subsidiary so assumes the defense
of any Claim for such Indemnified Persons pursuant to the foregoing sentence,
none of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries will be liable to such
Indemnified Persons for any defense costs or expenses (including attorneys\'
fees and expenses) subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Persons in the
defense of such Claim (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any other
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or other expenses therefrom,
including from the disposition of any such Claim, that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.04)_. Neither an Indemnified
Person nor the Parent, the Surviving Corporation of any of its Subsidiaries
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought without
the prior written consent of Parent, in the case of the Indemnified Persons,
or the Indemnified Persons, in the case of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Such Indemnified Person shall cooperate
with the Parent and its applicable Subsidiaries in the defense of any matter
for which such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification hereunder.

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and the Company\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies; _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and the Company shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and _provided_ that the premium payable for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the premium amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (such maximum amount, the " _Maximum Tail Premium_ ") and if the cost for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium. Parent shall cause any such "tail" policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent to assist in obtaining such additional "tail" insurance policies as Parent may reasonably request. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_ (including this _Section 7.04(d)_). 

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.04_ shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise. These rights shall survive the consummation of the Merger in accordance with their terms. After the Effective Time, the covenants contained in this _Section 7.04_  are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. After the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 7.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to 

  

      

  

adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person without the consent of
such Indemnified Person.

  

 (f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.04_ (including by advancing such expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim seeking to enforce such obligations). 

  

  

    Section 7.05. _ Employee Matters_.  

  

  

 (a) With respect to employees who are actively employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately before the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), for a period of twelve months following the Closing (or, if earlier, until the termination of the applicable Company Employee\'s employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for so long as a Company Employee is employed or engaged by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, provide compensation and benefits to such Company Employee that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company Employee than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses and nonqualified deferred compensation) and benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits) provided to the Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.05(a)_ , from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume and honor during the twelve-month period following the Effective Time (or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been satisfied) all of the Company\'s employment, severance, bonus, incentive compensation, commission, change in control, retention and termination plans and agreements, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event) in accordance with their respective terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.05(b)_ shall (i) impair the enforceability of any Company severance agreements that may by their terms remain in effect beyond such twelve-month period or (ii) limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement with any Company Employee to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of such Company Employee Plan or other plan, agreement or arrangement as in effect on the date hereof. 

  

 (c) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat each Company Employee\'s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary under the comparable Company Employee Plans) as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, benefit accruals (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan) and for purposes of determining future vacation and paid time-off accruals and severance amounts under any employee benefit plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. 

  

 (d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which any 

  

      

  

Company Employee (or the dependents of any eligible Company Employee) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time to the same extent
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under any similar Company
Employee Plan the Company Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under the Parent health or welfare benefit plan and (ii) recognize
the dollar amount of all payments incurred by each Company Employee (and his
or her eligible dependents) prior to the Effective Time under any applicable
Company Employee Plan during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such calendar year\'s deductible, co-payment
limitations and out-of-pocket maximums under the relevant welfare benefit
plans in which such Company Employee will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time to the same extent such payments were recognized
under any similar Company Employee Plan that such Company
Employee participated in immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 7.05_ with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof, in any Company Employee Plan or Parent Employee Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.05_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plans of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or shall prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan.

Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Stock issuable in connection with the Merger to
be authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.

  

    Section 7.07. _ Access to Information. _ From the date
hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, Parent shall during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, (a) give to the Company, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other Representatives reasonable access to the
personnel, advisors, agents, offices, properties, Contracts and books and
records of Parent and its Subsidiaries and (b) cause its Subsidiaries, and
instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
Representatives, to reasonably cooperate with the Company in such access;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the foregoing shall not require Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries to permit access to (A) any information that is
subject to attorney-client privilege or similar privilege or the work product
doctrine, (B) any information that in the reasonable opinion of Parent would
violate any Applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case
of subclause (A) and this subclause (B), Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate the applicable information to the Company in a way that
would not violate the Applicable Law or waive such privilege or work-product
doctrine), (C) such documents or information that are reasonably pertinent to
any litigation, suit, action or proceeding between Company and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and the Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand, or (D)

the actions of Parent\'s Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) with
respect to the foregoing, whether prior to or after execution of this
Agreement, (ii) any such access shall be provided under supervision of
appropriate personnel of Parent and in such a manner as not to unreasonably

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the efforts referenced in _Section 8.01(a)_ , Parent (i) shall take any and all action necessary, including (1) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (2) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (3) terminating any venture or other arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (4) creating any relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (5) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or its Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree with), in each case, as required by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction under an applicable Foreign Antitrust Law (collectively, " _Antitrust Authority_ ") in connection with the Merger under Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , that any such action may be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") and to ensure that no Antitrust Authority enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent) preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be required to sell, dispose of, hold separate, agree to sell or dispose of, terminate, create or effectuate any other change or restructuring (or enter into any agreement or stipulation), or otherwise agree or commit to, or otherwise effect, any Divestiture Action (A) with respect to any assets, categories of assets or businesses, relationships, rights, obligations, ventures or other arrangements of the Company or any of its Affiliates that would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) with respect to any of Parent\'s, Merger Subsidiary\'s or any of their respective Affiliates\' respective assets (including the stock of the Company, after the Merger), categories of assets or businesses, relationships, rights, obligations, ventures or other arrangements (any of the foregoing in this proviso, individually or together with any other Divestiture Action, a " _Burdensome Divestiture Condition_ "); and (ii) shall not consummate or enter into any agreement providing for any acquisition by it or its Subsidiaries of any interest in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of business similar to the Company\'s products, services or lines of business if such action would make it materially more likely that there would arise any impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable. In the event that any action is instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take all action necessary, including litigation on the merits and/or any Divestiture Action to resist, avoid or resolve such action up to a Burdensome Divestiture Condition. In the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any and all steps, up to a Burdensome Divestiture Condition, necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting and reducing any Divestiture Action, provided that, unless requested in writing by Parent, the Company shall not propose, negotiate, agree or commit to, or otherwise effect any Divestiture Action.

The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as so corrected to be disseminated to its stockholders to the extent required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (d) Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of shares of Parent Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. 

  

 (e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take any other action required to be taken by it under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE in connection with the filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of the Company thereunder.

In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide information concerning it necessary to enable the Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation of the Form S-4 and/or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. 

  

 (g) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act. Parent agrees that the Form S-4, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act.

or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 (i) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

are incorporated by reference into and made a part of this Agreement. The
mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an item of disclosure to a
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision hereof shall
not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or
Parent, as applicable.

Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement

jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

    Section 11.13. _ Specific Performance. _ The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if

this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to any valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief in the event of any breach or to

provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 11.08_ without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement at law or in equity, and the right

have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that,
prior to any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
10.01_ , it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
11.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.
