PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 2.01 Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at the Closing, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase
from Seller, the Units for the consideration specified in Section 2.02.

Section 2.02 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Units shall
be $190,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as set forth in
this Agreement.

Section 2.03 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Closing Adjustment.

(i) At least two Business Days before the Closing, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth its good
faith estimate of each of the following:

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Closing Working Capital; 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Closing Cash, calculated using the same accounting principles with consistent
estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Interim
Balance Sheet for the most recent fiscal year end; 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

Closing Indebtedness, calculated using the same accounting principles with
consistent estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
Interim Balance Sheet for the most recent fiscal year end; 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

Transaction Expenses, calculated using the same accounting principles with
consistent estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the
Interim Balance Sheet for the most recent fiscal year end; 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein) prepared in accordance
with GAAP; and 

| 
---|--- 

(F)

|

the Closing Adjustment. 

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to (i) Closing Working
Capital plus $4,800,000 (the "Target Working Capital"), which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be a positive or negative amount, (ii) plus Closing
Cash, (iii) less Closing Indebtedness, (iv) less Transaction Expenses, in each
case, using the estimates of such items set forth in the Closing Statement. If
the Closing Adjustment is a positive number and is greater than $50,000, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If
the Closing



12

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



Adjustment is a negative number, the absolute value of which is greater than
$50,000, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the absolute value of the
Closing Adjustment.

(b) Post-Closing Statement. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller Representative a statement (the "Post-Closing
Statement") setting forth its good faith calculation of each item required to
be included in the Closing Statement.

(c) Examination and Review.

(i) Examination. Seller Representative shall have 60 days (the "Review
Period") to review the Post-Closing Statement after delivery thereof. During
the Review Period, Seller Representative and Seller Representative's
Accountants shall have such access as Seller Representative may reasonably
request to the financial information and books and records of the Company and
the personnel of Buyer and/or Buyer's Accountants, in each case to the extent
that they relate to the Post-Closing Statement, for the purpose of reviewing
the Post-Closing Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections, provided,
that such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal business operations of Buyer or the Company.

(ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller
Representative may object to the Post-Closing Statement by delivering to Buyer
a written statement setting forth Seller Representative's objections in
reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for
Seller Representative's disagreement therewith (the "Statement of
Objections"). If Seller Representative fails to deliver the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Post-Closing
Statement, including Buyer's calculation of the Closing Adjustment reflected
in the Post-Closing Statement, shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller
Representative. If Seller Representative delivers the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller Representative
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after
the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if
the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Closing Adjustment
and the Post-Closing Statement, with such changes as are agreed in writing by
Buyer and Seller Representative, shall be final and binding.

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If Seller Representative and Buyer fail to reach
an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amount
remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amount not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to Ernst and Young LLP
or, if Ernst and Young LLP is unable to serve, Buyer and Seller Representative
shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally
recognized firm of independent certified public accountants other than Seller
Representative\'s Accountants or Buyer\'s Accountants (the "Independent
Accountants") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Statement.
The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to
materiality. The



13

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



Independent Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by
the parties and may not assign a value to the Closing Adjustment greater than
Seller's calculation thereof or less than Buyer's calculation thereof.

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountants. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Seller Representative, on the one
hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the
amount actually contested but not awarded to Seller Representative or Buyer,
respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by Seller
Representative and Buyer.

(v) Determination by Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days (or such
other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments
to the Post-Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment.

(i) Following the final determination of the Closing Adjustment in accordance
with Section 2.03(c), the Purchase Price shall be recalculated using such
final Closing Adjustment. Any difference between the recalculated Purchase
Price and the Purchase Price as it was originally calculated at Closing under
Section 2.03(a)(ii) (the "Post-Closing Adjustment") shall be paid to Seller
Representative, if the recalculated Purchase Price is greater, or to Buyer, if
the original Purchase Price is greater.

(ii) Payments to Seller Representative shall be paid by Buyer via wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is directed by
Seller Representative by the Post-Closing Payment Date. Payments to Buyer
shall be paid (1) first from the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount; (2) then,
to the extent the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient, from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount; (3) then, to the extent the Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount and Indemnity Escrow Amount are insufficient, directly from Seller
Representative on behalf of Seller to Buyer via wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account as is directed by Buyer; in each case, by the
Post-Closing Payment Date.

(iii) The balance of the Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount after making the
payments contemplated under Section 2.03(d)(ii), if any, shall be disbursed to
Seller Representative for the benefit of Seller by the Post-Closing Payment
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if no payment is due to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 2.03(d), the entire Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
disbursed to Seller Representative for the benefit of Seller.

(iv) Any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment, together with interest
calculated as set forth below, or disbursement from the Closing Adjustment
Escrow Amount or the Indemnity Escrow Amount, as the case may be, shall be due
(x) within five Business Days of acceptance of the Post-Closing Statement or
Statement of Objections, as applicable, or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts,
then within five Business Days of the resolution described in Section
2.03(c)(v) (the



14

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



"Post-Closing Payment Date"). The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment shall
bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall
Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the Closing Date. Such interest shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days
elapsed.

(e) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.03
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 2.04 Transactions to be Effected at the Closing.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver:

(i) to Seller, the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section

shall deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent the Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount, which shall be held in separate
accounts and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
Representative will share equally the payment of any fees and expenses payable
to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which will not be
deducted from the Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount. On the fifth Business Day following the General Survival Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release to Seller from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
$6,650,000, less (a) the amount of all resolved and paid claims and less (b)

in accordance with Article VII.

the purchase and sale of the Units contemplated hereby shall take place at a

Price and the liabilities of the Company to the assets of the Company for all
Tax purposes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code (the

Purchase Price Allocation, Seller Representative notifies Buyer in writing
that Seller Representative objects to the allocation set forth in the Purchase

statements of use.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, and to
the Knowledge of Seller, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Owned Intellectual Property Right or Licensed Intellectual
Property Right. The Company has taken reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of all Intellectual Property Rights of the Company that are
material to the business or operation of the Company and the value of which to
the Company is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof. The
failure to obtain written confidentiality agreements in connection with the

representatives or agents, or other Persons, is not materially adverse to the
Company.

Security Standards are set forth solely in Section 3.20 hereof. There is no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, each
Benefit Plan and related trust complies in all material respects with all
applicable Laws (including ERISA and the Code). Each Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Qualified
Benefit Plan") has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an opinion
letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the prototype plan sponsor, to the
effect that such Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the plan and
the trust related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and, to Seller\'s Knowledge,
nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the revocation
of such determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or the
unavailability of reliance on such opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service. Except as set forth in Section 3.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedules,
all benefits, contributions and premiums required by and due under the terms
of each Benefit Plan or applicable Law have been timely paid in accordance
with the terms of such Benefit Plan, the terms of all applicable Laws and
GAAP. With respect to each Benefit Plan, to Seller\'s Knowledge, no event has
occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that has resulted in or would
subject the Company to a Tax under Section 4971 of the Code or the assets of
the Company to a lien under Section 430(k) of the Code. To Seller's Knowledge,
no fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) of any Benefit
Plan subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has committed a
breach of fiduciary duty with respect to that Benefit Plan that could subject
the Company or an Employee to any liability (including liability on account of
an indemnification obligation). No Company has incurred any excise Taxes under
Chapter 43 of the Code and nothing has occurred with respect to any Benefit
Plan that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company to any such
Taxes (including on account of an indemnification obligation).

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(c) of the Disclosure Schedules, no
Benefit Plan: (i) is subject to Title IV of ERISA or the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; or (ii) is a
"multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), and none of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate otherwise has any liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of Seller, the Company
and any ERISA Affiliate: (i) has withdrawn from any pension plan under
circumstances resulting (or expected to result) in a liability to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or such pension plan; or (ii) has engaged in any
transaction which could give rise to a liability (including a contingent
liability) of the Company or Buyer under Section 4069 or Section 4212(c) of
ERISA. No Benefit Plan is, and the Company does not have any liability with
respect to, a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA).

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(d) of the Disclosure Schedules and
other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable
similar Law, no Benefit Plan provides, or has an obligation to provide,
benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or disability insurance (i)
following retirement or other termination of employment (other than

death benefits when termination occurs upon death) or (ii) to an individual
who is not a current or former employee of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate
(or a dependent thereof). None of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any
liability on account of a violation of Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(e) of the Disclosure Schedules, (i)
there is no pending or, to Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened action relating to
a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits); and (ii) no Benefit
Plan is currently or has within the three years prior to the date hereof been
the subject of an examination or audit by a Governmental Authority.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, no
Benefit Plan exists that could: (i) result in the payment to any Employee,
director or consultant of any money or other property; (ii) accelerate the
vesting of or provide any additional rights or benefits (including funding of
compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise) to any Employee,
director or consultant, except as a result of any partial plan termination
resulting from this Agreement; or (iii) limit or restrict the ability of Buyer
or its Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan, in each case,
as a result of the execution of this Agreement, whether alone or together with
any subsequent transaction such as termination of employment.

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether alone or together with any
subsequent transaction such as termination of employment, will result in
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.
None of the Company, Seller or any of their Affiliates has any obligation to
make a "gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any Taxes that may become
payable under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(h) Buyer has been provided with a list of employees and other service
providers of the Company, together with such individual's title, hire date,
location, whether full- or part-time, whether active or on leave (and, if on
leave, the nature of the leave and the expected return date), whether exempt

investigations or other legal proceedings against the Company pending, or to
Seller\'s Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, by or with any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator in connection with the employment of any
current employee of the Company, including, without limitation, any claim
relating to unfair labor practices, employment discrimination, harassment,
retaliation, equal pay or any other employment related matter arising under
applicable Laws.

(c) Each current non-employee Company service provider is a true contractor

with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate (including

investigation or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, brought by
any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

either party prior to the Closing before any Governmental Authority or the
staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, relating to the

hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the
intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any such meeting, discussion, appearance or
contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any

notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described
in Section 3.05, Section 6.02(f) and Section 4.02 of the Disclosure Schedules,

their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,

exists on the Closing Date; or

(ii) for a period of three full years after the Closing Date, employ or
solicit, or receive or accept the performance of services by any employee of

employing any such person who contacts Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on
his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by, or
encouragement from, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that
the publication of advertisements in newspapers and/or electronic media of
general circulation (including advertisements posted on the Internet) will not
be deemed a violation of this Section.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations contained in Section 5.12(a)(i) hereof,
nothing herein shall prohibit SmartCare OS, LLC ("SmartCare") from marketing
its services or providing its services to preschools, daycare service
providers or childcare service providers so long as SmartCare and its
Affiliates, officers, directors, members, owners, managers, agents,
independent contractors, representatives, consultants, investors or advisors,
do not, directly or indirectly, in connection with the provision of such
services or otherwise, (i) market, promote, sell, advertise or publicize the
payment and billing (including collections) aspects of its services to non-
public schools with students in the second grade or higher or (ii) provide any
of its payment and billing (including collections) services to non-public
schools with students in the second grade or higher, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Buyer; provided, however, that any mass marketing or
promotional efforts or the publication of advertisements in newspapers and/or

consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all of its properties and assets of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to another Person, unless the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in this Section to the
same extent as Seller and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
SmartCare shall be permitted to consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell,
convey or transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
another Person who competes with the Business so long as the surviving entity
or transferee agrees in writing to comply with Section 5.12 to the extent
relating in any manner to the SmartCare products or services.

(d) If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section, but
this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties
that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover
a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under
Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret
or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable

under such Applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably
harmed by any breach of this Section and that there would be no adequate
remedy at law or in damages to compensate Buyer for any such breach. Seller
agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific
performance by Seller of this Section, and Seller consents to the entry
thereof.

Section 5.13 Exclusivity. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article IX, Seller shall not, and shall cause the
Company not to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any

substantially all of the equity interests or assets of the Company (including
any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange) or
(ii) enter into, maintain or continue discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish or disclose to any Person any information in connection with any
acquisition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or assets of
the Company (including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation

or purchase agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement with any
Person other than Buyer with respect to acquisition of all or substantially
all of the equity interests or assets of the Company (including any

Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such Ultimate

merge or consolidate with another entity without first appointing a new Seller
Representative. Notice and a copy of the written consent appointing such new
representative and bearing the signatures of a majority in interest of the
Ultimate Sellers, along with a consent in writing of such new representative

Section 5.15 Customer Information. Within ten Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide to Buyer a complete customer list
specifying (a) the legal name of such customer and (b) the Tax ID number for
such customer (the "Customer Data"); provided, however, that if the Company

missing or inaccurate. Following the delivery of such list and until the
Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Customer
Data from each of the Unconfirmed Customers as promptly as practicable and
shall provide, on a weekly basis, an updated listing of the Customer Data for
Buyer's review. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
such information is accurate and complete, and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to verify the accuracy and completeness of such
information. Buyer and Seller shall confer regularly during the pre-Closing
period on the progress in and priorities for obtaining Customer Data from

claimed Losses in respect of Ordinary Breach Claims exceeds $1,000,000 (the
"Threshold"), in which event the Indemnifying Party be required to pay or be
liable for all such Losses from the first dollar thereof. With respect to any
Ordinary Breach Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed $50,000 (which
Losses shall, not be counted toward the Threshold).

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses arising out of Ordinary Breach Claims
for which an Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to Section 7.02 shall
not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount and in no event shall the aggregate of
all indemnification amounts paid by Seller for Losses arising out of Ordinary
Breach Claims hereunder exceed that amount. Any indemnity payments for Losses
due pursuant to Section 7.02 shall be made first from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and then, to the
extent such Losses exceed the remaining Indemnity Escrow Amount and do not
arise from Ordinary Breach Claims, directly by Seller; provided, however, that
to the extent any amounts are released from the escrow account and deducted
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount with respect to claims other than Ordinary
Breach Claims, such released amounts shall not reduce the amount that Buyer
may recover with respect to Ordinary Breach Claims.

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 7.02 in respect of
any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that
remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (excluding the
proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates) and any indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim, offset
by the net present value of any resulting premium increases and net of any
collection costs; provided, that nothing in this Agreement shall require an
Indemnified Party to pursue payments under insurance policies or indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
limitations, thresholds, qualifications and similar provisions set forth in
this Section 7.04 shall not apply with respect to indemnifiable Losses
resulting from (1) actual fraud, with intent to deceive, any intentional
misrepresentation upon which Buyer has relied to its material detriment, or
willful breach, or (2) any non-monetary equitable remedy pursuant to Section
10.11.

(e) The Buyer and the Seller will reasonably cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim with respect to which any Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification hereunder. Upon knowledge by an executive officer of an
Indemnified Party of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to an indemnification claim under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid, remedy or mitigate any Losses
for which it is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder (it being
understood and agreed that any out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred
in connection with such avoidance, remedy or mitigation shall themselves
constitute Losses).

Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Notices Generally. Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.02 shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice of any matter
that such Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of Losses, if known,
and method of computation thereof, in reasonable detail, and containing a
reference to the specific provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. Insofar as Buyer desires
to make a claim against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, then Buyer shall also
provide such written notice to the Escrow Agent. The procedures relating to
indemnification claims against the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be further
governed, where applicable, by the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Third-Party Claims.

(i) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing against such Indemnified Party
with respect to which the



54

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written pleadings and correspondence
related thereto and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure.

(ii) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 7.05 and Section
8.02, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense and with the
Indemnifying Party\'s choice of lead counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided, that prior to assuming
control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must (i) acknowledge that it
would have an indemnity obligation for the Losses resulting from such Third-
Party Claim as provided under this Article VII and (ii) furnish the
Indemnified Party with evidence that the Indemnifying Party has adequate
resources to defend the Third-Party Claim and fulfill such indemnity
obligations arising in connection therewith.

(iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, subject to the limitations of this Section 7.05 and Section
8.02, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such
Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall in such event have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with separate
counsel selected by it; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
(A) incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the date Seller Representative
assumes control of the defense of the Third-Party Claim or (B) if
representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the
same counsel would, upon the advice of counsel, create a conflict of interest.

(iv) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain
control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (1) the Indemnifying
Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend within 15
days of receipt of notice of the Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section
7.05(b)(i), (2) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (3)
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the Third-Party Claim would be detrimental to the reputation or
future business prospects of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(4) the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or any of its



55

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



Affiliates, (5) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute
or defend vigorously the Third-Party Claim, (6) the Third-Party Claim involves
liability for Taxes and is not limited to a claim for Taxes due from the
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (provided that, in such case, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
claim for Taxes due from the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in the
manner set forth in Section 8.02) or (7) the specified damages of such Third-
Party Claim exceeds an amount equal to the amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount then remaining in the escrow account, less (x) the sum of (A) the
amount subject to any other unresolved or unpaid indemnification claims and
(B) the reasonably anticipated expenses for litigation of such Third-Party
Claim, plus (y) to the extent such Losses would be covered by the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, the aggregate amount the insurer
remains liable to pay in respect of claims made, as set forth in the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy documentation, at the time the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense.

(v) The Indemnified Party, Indemnifying Party and Seller Representative shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, with each other
in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, including making available such records, information and testimony, and
attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or
appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, provided that
in no event shall the Indemnified Party be required to incur third party costs
or expenses without reimbursement.

(c) Settlement of Third-Party Claims.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party may not enter into a settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in this Section 7.05(c).
If a firm offer is made to settle such Third-Party Claim which (1) does not
lead to any liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on
the part of any Indemnified Party, (2) does not impose any injunctive or other
equitable relief on any Indemnified Party and (3) provides, in customary form,
for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities
and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten days
after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense
of such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of
such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth
in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim.

(ii) If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim
pursuant to this Section 7.05, it may agree to any settlement thereof without
the consent of the



56

ACTIVE 209289734v.13

* * *



Indemnifying Party or Seller Representative; provided, that such settlement
shall not be binding upon the Indemnifying Party without the written consent
of such Indemnifying Party or Seller Representative (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third-Party Claim
relating to Taxes without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(d) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof (except that this
provision shall not apply to information or documents that are privileged
under applicable Law, including attorney work product), and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party, taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30
days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party\'s investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Company\'s
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
conclusively admitted liability for the claim and the Indemnified Party shall
be paid in accordance with Section 7.03.

Section 7.06 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

Section 7.07 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.11, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims (other than claims arising from actual fraud with intent to
deceive, any intentional misrepresentation upon which Buyer has relied to its
material detriment, or willful breach, in each case, on the part of a party
hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for
any breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under
Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any breach of any
representation or warranty set forth herein it may have against the other
parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives arising under or based upon any Law (other than claims arising
from actual fraud with intent to deceive, any intentional misrepresentation
upon which Buyer has relied to its material detriment, or willful breach, in
each case, on the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article VII. Nothing in this Section 7.07 shall
limit any Person\'s right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to Section 10.11.

ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01 Tax Returns.

(a) Seller will be responsible for preparing all Tax Returns of the Company
for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (collectively, the

manner consistent with the past practices of the Company, except as otherwise
required by Law, and will be delivered to Buyer for review and comment within
a reasonable time prior to the applicable deadline(s) for filing, but in no
event less than fifteen (15) days prior to the filing deadline applicable to

Return in a timely manner with the appropriate Tax authorities and (ii) pay
any amount of Taxes shown as due on such Pre-Closing Return on or prior to the
due date for such payment. Buyer shall (or shall cause the Company and its
officers to) cooperate, to the extent necessary, in connection with execution
and submission of each Pre-Closing Return.

(b) Buyer will be responsible for preparing all Tax Returns of the Company for
any Straddle Period. Each such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner

practices of the Company, except as required by Law, and shall be delivered to
Seller for review and comment within a reasonable time prior to the applicable
deadline(s) for filing, but in no event less than fifteen (15) days prior to
the filing deadline applicable to such Tax Return. Buyer shall take into
account any reasonable comments received from Seller prior to the applicable
due date for filing each Tax Return for a Straddle Period and shall file, or
cause to be filed, such Tax Return in a timely manner with the appropriate Tax
authorities. Each of Seller and Buyer shall pay their respective shares, as
determined in a manner consistent with Section 8.01(d), of any Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Return on or prior to the due date for such payment.

(c) Except as required by applicable Law or pursuant to a final determination
by any Tax authority, Buyer will not file or cause to be filed an amended Tax
Return for the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, file Tax Returns for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction where the Company has not
historically filed Tax Returns, initiate discussions or examinations with any
Tax authority regarding Taxes due from the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, change any accounting method of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, adopt any accounting method or similar convention that shifts income
from a period beginning (or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date to a
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date or
shifts deductions or losses from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a period
beginning (or deemed to begin) after the Closing Date, or undertake any
extraordinary action (i.e., an action outside the ordinary course of business)
after the Closing on the Closing Date that has a material risk of affecting
the amount of Taxes due from the Company, Seller or any of its respective
Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d) For purposes of determining Seller's and Buyer's respective responsibility
for Taxes due from the Company, including any Covered Taxes described in
clause (a) of the definition thereof in respect of a Straddle Period, (x) in
the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales, use, net or gross
income, or other Taxes based upon or related to income or transactions, Taxes
due for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to include the amount of such
Tax calculated for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any gross receipts, sales,
use, net or gross income, or other Taxes based upon or related to income or
transactions, Taxes due for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
include the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on
and included the Closing Date; provided, however, that for purposes of
calculating the foregoing, any exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated between the period ending on
the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion
to the number of days in each period, relative to the number of days in the
entire Tax period.

receipt of any written notice from a Tax authority that involves the assertion

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall be entitled
to control the contest or resolution of any Tax proceeding or Tax audit
relating solely to Taxes for which Seller may be liable hereunder for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
(i) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
unless it involves Taxes, Losses or other liability for which Seller is not

both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of

Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth
as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this

written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.
