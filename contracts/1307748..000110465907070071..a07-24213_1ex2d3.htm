relating to any of the Acquired Companies and as Parent may reasonably
request, (b) assist in providing the Buyer Parties and their respective
Representatives with access to, and facilitate discussions with, the managers
of

provided that Parent shall agree that the Buyer Parties shall repair all
damages caused by such testing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the

Companies, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior consent of the
Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (ii) contact or

have Representatives present at all times during any inspection.

jeopardize such attorney-client privilege, or contravene any Legal
Requirement or the terms of any binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that upon the request of Parent, each
of the Acquired Companies shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
consent from the applicable third party or enter into a customary joint
defense agreement, if applicable, to enable the disclosure of such

may furnish such information to any Person (including financing sources) and
its Representatives in connection with such Persons potential investment in
Parent or its Affiliates, or evaluation of the acquisition of assets of the
Company in connection with or following the Closing, in each case so long as

in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company agrees that all Tax
Returns with respect to the Company and each other Acquired Company that are

any negotiations, or accept any offers, regarding the sale, exchange, or
other conveyance of any equity securities of any of the Acquired Companies or
of any interest in any of the Properties until the later of the Closing Date,

extend the Closing Date, or such sooner date as this Agreement may be
terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the
Escrow is cancelled.

        

Section 6.4 _Operation of the Hotels_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
the Company Parties, during the Pre-Closing Period, shall cause the current

Company Parties shall pay and perform or shall cause the Owner of the Hotels
to pay and perform all of their material obligations and otherwise comply
with all of the material terms and conditions of the covenants and other
agreements of record reflected in the Contracts, the Franchise Agreements,
the Management Agreement Documents, the Existing Indebtedness (and all
documents evidencing, securing or relating to the Existing Indebtedness
(including, but not limited to, causing any guarantors and indemnitors to
perform their obligations thereunder)). During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company Parties shall maintain (or replace with policies of like amounts) all
existing insurance policies insuring the Properties and the operation of
the Hotels. The Company Parties shall not remove any of the personal
property from the Properties, unless the Company Parties replace the same
with like items that are of equal or better quality and condition. The
Company Parties shall maintain the inventory and food consistent with the
Company Parties and Acquired Companies past practices, and will replenish
the same consistent with their past practices. The Company Parties may,
extend, amend, modify or terminate any of the Contracts as the Company
Parties deem appropriate to operate, service and maintain the Properties
consistent with normal business practices, and may enter into new Contracts;
_provided_ , _however_ , that so long as Parent is not in default of any of
its obligations under this Agreement, (a) during the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company Parties shall provide to Parent copies of new Contracts, which any of
the Company Parties or Acquired Companies has entered into, or intends to
enter into, (b) from and after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period,
the Company Parties shall not, without the written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter
into (i) any leases of furniture, fixtures or equipment for the Hotel, or
(ii) any Contract other than consistent with past practices, (c) other than
in the ordinary course of business at the Properties, no part of
the Properties, or any interest therein, will be sold or otherwise
transferred or encumbered without Parents prior written consent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (d) without the prior
written approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), the Company Parties and the Acquired Companies shall not: (i)
make any material alterations to the Properties other than alteration in
accordance with the terms of a PIP, or, (ii) remove or otherwise dispose of
any material portion of any of their personal property, except in the
ordinary course of business and (e) the Company Parties shall pay all of
their debts, liabilities and obligations as and when the same become due.
 Prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, without Parents approval (which may be withheld in its sole
and absolute discretion), the Company Parties (A) except as contemplated
herein, shall not amend the Existing Indebtednesses or any documents
evidencing, securing or otherwise relating to the Existing Indebtednesses,
and (B) shall not prepay any part of the Existing Indebtednesses. In all
instances where the consent or approval of the Parent may be required,
such consent or approval shall be deemed to have been given if Parent fails
to respond to any request by any Company Party within five (5) days following
such request.

  

Section 6.5 _Cooperation_. The Company Parties shall cooperate with Parent in
all reasonable respects, including by executing and delivering necessary or
desirable applications and other documents, to facilitate the issuance and/or
transfer of the Permits and other authorizations in connection with the
operation of the Hotels, including any liquor licenses or

        

permits. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company Parties for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company Parties in
connection with such cooperation.  To the extent any license is not
transferable, but is necessary for any aspect of the operation of the Hotel,
the Company Parties and the Owners of the Hotels shall cooperate with Parent
by entering into such arrangements as may be usual and customary in similar
transactions, provided that any such arrangements are fully in compliance
with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, that Parent either pays for
or promptly reimburses the Company Parties for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses to be or actually incurred by the Company Parties in connection
therewith, and that Parent indemnifies and holds the Company Parties harmless
from and against any liabilities arising in connection therewith.

  

Section 6.6 _Alcoholic Beverage Matters_. To the extent that a license or
permit required for the service of alcoholic beverages at a Hotel (a "
_Liquor Permit_ ") involves any responsibility or liability of the Company
Parties or their Affiliates, the Company Parties shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable laws, rules or regulations, transfer such Liquor
Permit to Parent (or, at the request of the Parent, to the Manager) at
Closing, at Parents expense, provided that the Company Parties and their
Affiliates shall be fully released from any responsibility or liability
thereunder. If individuals or entities affiliated with the Company Parties
who are designated as parties on any Liquor Permits cannot be released prior
to the Closing, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if the
entity which holds the Liquor Permit wishes to retain such Liquor Permit
pending the release of such individuals or entities (which is to occur within
not more than ninety (90) days), Parent shall cooperate with the
Company Parties by entering, or causing another entity with adequate
wherewithal to enter, into an indemnity agreement with such individuals or
entities remaining liable or responsible on a Liquor Permit, such indemnity
agreement to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such
individuals or entities.

of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the Escrow Agent
shall release the remainder of the Company Termination Fee to Parent. The
Company agrees to amend this  _Section 11.3(c)_ at the reasonable request of
Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Company Termination Fee
that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii)
improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
_Section 11.3(c)_ or (iii) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this _Section 11.3(c)_. The
escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Company
Termination Fee held in escrow for five (5) years shall be released by the
Escrow Agent to the Company.

  

### (d) In the event that the Company is required to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to a termination of this Agreement, such amount
shall be paid into escrow as provided in _Section 11.3(c)_ as promptly as
practicable following such termination, but in no event more than two (2)
business days following such termination.

  

### (e) The parties hereto agree and understand that in no event shall the
Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Earnest Money Deposit, respectively, on more than one occasion. The parties
hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 11.3_ are
an integral part of the

        

### Merger Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the parties
hereto would not enter into this Agreement. In the event any party hereto is
required to file suit to seek all or portion of the amounts payable under
this _Section 11.3_, and such party hereto prevails in such litigation, such
party hereto shall be awarded to all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, that it has incurred in enforcing
its rights under this _Section 11.3_.

  

 **ARTICLE XII 
 TITLE; DUE DILIGENCE**

  

Section 12.1 _Title to the Real Property_.

  

### (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, but conditioned upon Closing and at
Parents sole cost and expense, Title Company shall endorse each Title Policy
to make such Title Policy effective as of the date of Closing and shall
endorse each such Title Policy with a non-imputation endorsement in favor of
Parent.

  

### (b) In addition, Parent shall have the right to obtain from Title
Company, at Parents expense such additional endorsements to the Title
Policies and such additional liability protection as Parent may elect to
obtain; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents ability to obtain such title
endorsements and such additional liability protection shall not be a
condition precedent to Parents obligations hereunder and shall not extend or
delay Closing. Parent shall be solely responsible for negotiating with Title
Company with respect to the transfer and endorsement of each Title Policy
and/or with respect to such title endorsements and/or such additional
liability protection as may be requested by Parent, if any. With respect to
each Property, the Company Parties will deliver to Parent a copy of any
survey of the Property in its possession, without warranty, and Parent shall
be solely responsible for, and shall assume the risk of, obtaining a survey
(or updating the Company Parties survey) of such Property (each a " _Survey_
").

  

Section 12.2 _Inspection and Due Diligence Review_.

  

### (a) Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, until 5:00 p.m.
EST on the day which is the twenty-third (23rd) day following the Effective
Date, to satisfy itself, in its sole and absolute discretion, of all matters
relating to the Merger Transactions, including, but not limited to the
condition and extent of the Properties and all matters related to the
organization of the Company and any entities owned and/or controlled by the
Company (" _Due Diligence Period_ "). Subject to the prior termination of
this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement, the Company Parties
shall cooperate and provide Parent with reasonable and continuing access to
the Properties upon commercially reasonable Notice to the Company for the
purpose of Parents inspection and due diligence review. In connection with
such review, during normal business hours during the Due Diligence Period,
Parent shall be afforded the opportunity to review reasonably available
records, including non-proprietary financial reports, the instruments
evidencing the Contracts pertaining to the Hotels which are in or under the
Companys control and relate to the operation of the Hotels upon reasonable
Notice, except that the

        

### Company Parties shall have no obligation to deliver or make available to
Parent, and Parent shall have no right to review, the Excluded Assets and the
Excluded Documents. Neither Parent nor any of its employees, agents or
representatives shall contact or otherwise discuss this transaction or the
operation of the Hotels with any on-site employees of the Hotels; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Parent may meet with any Hotels general manager
upon commercially reasonable Notice to the Company but, if required by the
Company, only in the presence of the Companys representative. At any time
during the Due Diligence Period, Parent shall have the right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the
Company.

  

### (b) Parent acknowledges that prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company Parties have delivered to Parent, or the Company Parties have
provided Parent with access to, the information, documents, agreements and
reports relating to the Property, as identified on _Exhibit D_ attached
hereto (collectively, the " _Due Diligence Materials_ ").  Parent shall have
until the expiration of the Due Diligence Period to review and approve the
Due Diligence Materials.

  

### (c) Prior to any entry by Parent or any of Parents Representatives onto
any Property, Parent shall: (i) if Parent does not then have such a policy
in force, procure a policy of commercial general liability insurance, issued
by an insurer reasonably satisfactory to the Company Parties covering all of
Parents activities, with a single limit of liability (per occurrence and
aggregate) of not less than $2,000,000.00; and (ii) deliver to the Company
Parties a Certificate of Insurance, evidencing that such insurance is in
force and effect, and evidencing that the Company Parties have been named as
an additional insured thereunder with respect to any Parents activities
(such Certificate of Insurance shall be delivered to the Company Parties).
Such insurance shall be written on an "occurrence" basis, and shall be
maintained in force until the earlier of (x) the termination of this
Agreement and the conclusion of all Parents activities, or (y) Closing.

  

### (d) During the Due Diligence Period, Parent also shall have the
opportunity to conduct a Phase I environmental audit/study of all Property,
provided such Phase I environmental audit/study is not invasive or intrusive.
Any environmental audit/study proposed to be undertaken by Parent shall be
subject to the Companys written approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, prior to the commencement thereof.

  

### (e) Parent, at all times, will conduct such due diligence in compliance
with all applicable laws, and in a manner so as to not cause damage, loss,
cost or expense to the Company Parties, any Property or the tenants or guests
of any Property, and without unreasonably interfering with or disturbing any
employee, tenant or guest at the Hotels. Other than required by applicable
law, subpoena or other court order, Parent shall not reveal to
any governmental agency or any other third party (other than Parents
employees, agents, attorneys, lenders and advisors) not approved by the
Company the results of or any other information acquired pursuant to its
inspections. Parent will promptly restore any damage to the Property caused
by Parents inspection to its condition immediately preceding such
inspections and examinations and will keep the

        

### Property free and clear of any mechanics liens or materialmens liens in
connection with such inspections and examinations.

  

### (f) The cost of the inspections and tests undertaken pursuant to this
_Section 12.2_  shall be borne solely by Parent. Parent shall indemnify,
protect, defend, and hold the Company Parties, their lenders, and their
affiliates, owners, agents and employees harmless from and against any
obligation, liability, claim (including any claim for damage to property
or injury to or death of any persons), lien or encumbrance, loss, damage,
cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys fees, whether or not legal
proceedings are instituted, arising from the acts or omissions of Parent or
its agents, employees or contractors occurring in connection with, or as a
result of, such inspections, tests or examinations of any Property.

  

### (g) Parent covenants and agrees that, until the Closing Date, all such
information and materials disclosed or delivered to it by the Company
Parties, or their agents, employees and representatives, are confidential and
proprietary information, and that Parent shall hold the same in strict
confidence, and shall not disclose the same to anyone other than its
employees, affiliates, financial partners, potential lenders, and advisors on
a "need-to-know" basis subject to the confidentiality restrictions set forth
herein. Parent also agrees that, in the event the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement are not consummated as provided herein, Parent shall return
all such information and documentation, and all copies thereof, to the
Company promptly upon its written request, together with copies of all third-
party reports and studies obtained by Parent with respect to any of the
Properties.

  

### (h) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Company Parties
make no representations or warranties as to the truth, accuracy or
completeness of any materials, data or other information, if any, supplied to
Parent in connection with Parents inspection of the Property (e.g., that
such materials are complete, accurate or the final version thereof, or that
all such materials are in the Company Parties possession). It is the
parties express understanding and agreement that any such materials are to
be provided only for Parents convenience in making its own examination
and determination prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period as to
whether it wishes to purchase the Properties, and, in doing so, Parent shall
rely exclusively on its own independent investigation and evaluation of every
aspect of each Property and not on any materials supplied by the Company
Parties. Parent expressly disclaims any intent to rely on any such materials
provided to it by the Company Parties in connection with its inspection and
agrees that it shall rely solely on its own independently developed or
verified information.

  

### (i) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 12.2_ (including
its indemnification obligations) shall survive Closing or the termination of
this Agreement.

        

 **ARTICLE XIII 
 RISK OF LOSS**

  

With respect to each Property, the risk of loss shall be as follows:

  

Section 13.1 _Risk of Loss_. Until the Closing Date, the RLJ REITs shall bear
the risk of loss should there be damage to any of the Improvements by fire or
other casualty (collectively " _Casualty_ "). If, prior to the Closing Date,
any of the Improvements shall be damaged by any Casualty, the Company Parties
promptly shall notify Parent (" _Casualty Notice_ ") of such event. Upon
Parents receipt of a Casualty Notice, Representatives of the Company Parties
and the Buyer Parties shall meet promptly to estimate the cost to repair and
restore the Improvements to good condition and to replace any damaged
personal property (" _Casualty Renovation Cost_ "). If the parties are unable
to agree on the cost of restoration, the matter will be submitted to an
engineer designated by the Company Parties and an engineer designated by the
Buyer Parties, each licensed to practice in the state in which the Property
is located, and the engineers shall resolve the dispute. Each party hereto
shall bear the costs and expenses of its own engineer.

  

Section 13.2 _Material Loss_. If the Casualty Renovation Cost for any single
Hotel exceeds Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) or the Casualty Renovation
Cost for the aggregate of all the Hotels exceeds Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000), the Buyer Parties may elect, at their option, to terminate
this Agreement by notifying the Company within five (5) days after the date
that the Casualty Renovation Cost is determined, in which case the Earnest
Money Deposit shall be delivered to Parent, and neither party shall have any
further rights or obligations hereunder, except as explicitly provided in
this Agreement. If the Buyer Parties fail to make its election timely to
terminate this Agreement, then the Closing shall take place as provided
herein without reduction of the Company Merger Consideration, and Parent
shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds in connection with the Casualty
in the event the Casualty is insured against and the Company shall pay to
Parent the amount of any deductible, under applicable insurance policies, or
have the Company Merger Consideration reduced by the Casualty Renovation Cost
in the event the Casualty is not insured against.

  

Section 13.3 _Nonmaterial Loss_. If the Casualty Renovation Cost for
any single Hotel is Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) or less or the
Casualty Renovation Cost for the aggregate of all the Hotels is Twenty
Million Dollars ($20,000,000) or less, then, in any such event, neither the
Company Parties nor the Buyer Parties shall have any right to terminate this
Agreement, but the Closing shall take place as provided herein without
reduction of the Company Merger Consideration, and Parent shall be entitled
to all insurance proceeds in connection with the Casualty in the event the
Casualty is insured against or have the Company Merger Consideration reduced
by the Casualty Renovation Cost in the event the Casualty is not insured
against.

  

Section 13.4 _Eminent Domain_. If, prior to the Closing Date, all
or substantially all of any Property is taken by condemnation or eminent
domain, at the election of Parent, this Agreement, upon notifying the Company
of such election, shall terminate, and Parent shall receive a full and prompt
refund of all sums deposited by it with Escrow Agent or the Company Parties.
If, prior to the Closing Date, less than all or substantially all of any
Property shall be taken by condemnation or eminent domain, then Parent shall
be required to proceed with the

        

Merger Transactions, with title to the Property being subject to such taking,
in which event on the Closing Date all of the proceeds of any award or
payment made or to be made by reason of such taking shall belong to Parent,
and any money theretofore received by the Company Parties in connection with
such taking shall be paid over to Parent, whereupon Parent shall pay the
Company Merger Consideration without abatement by reason of such taking.
 The Company Parties shall not allow any Owner of a Hotel to settle, agree
to, or accept any award or payment in connection with a taking of less than
all of the Property without obtaining Parents prior written consent in each
case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

 **ARTICLE XIV

authorized by the board of directors (or as may otherwise be required by such
entity) of each party hereto.

 BY AND AMONG 
 RLJ URBAN LODGING REIT, LLC, 
 RLJ URBAN LODGING REIT (PF#1), LLC, 
 RLJ URBAN LODGING MASTER, LLC 
 AND INLAND AMERICAN REAL ESTATE TRUST, INC.**

  

THIS AMENDMENT NO 1 (this " _Amendment_ ") to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of August 12, 2007, by and among RLJ Urban Lodging REIT, LLC,
RLJ Urban Lodging REIT (PF#1), LLC, RLJ Urban Lodging Master, LLC and Inland
American Real Estate Trust, Inc. (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), is made and
entered into as of the 4th day of September, 2007, by and among the parties
to the Merger Agreement.

  

 ** _R_** _E_ _C_ _I_ _T_ _A_ _L_   _S_

  

A. Pursuant to Section 14.1 of the Merger Agreement, the parties to the
Merger Agreement may amend the Merger Agreement by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties to the Merger Agreement.

  

B. The parties to the Merger Agreement desire to amend Section 3.10 of the
Merger Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Operating Agreement shall be
and hereby is amended as follows:

  

# 1. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to them in the Operating Agreement.

  

# 2. Section 3.10 of the Merger Agreement shall be and hereby is deleted in
its entirety and replaced with the following:

  

Section 3.10 _PIP Work_. Franchisors of certain of the Properties have or
are expected to issue New PIPs in connection with the Merger Transaction.
Parent shall be responsible for (i) Costs of New PIP Work required pursuant
to the New PIPs and (ii) the costs of completing the existing requirements of
the applicable Franchisor of the Atlanta Marriott Century Center (the "
_Costs of the Atlanta Work_ ") (together, the Costs of New PIP Work and the
Costs of the Atlanta Work, are referred to as the " _Costs of Post-closing
PIP Work_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection therewith, the RLJ
REITs shall give a credit in the amount of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)
to Parent against the Company Merger Consideration at Closing (i.e., the
Company Merger Consideration shall be reduced by Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000)).  All additional Costs of Post-closing PIP Work shall be borne
by Parent. For purposes of this _Section 3.10_ , " _Costs of New PIP Work_ "
shall mean the costs of installing all of the improvements required by the
New PIPs regardless of the date when installation thereof is required.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.10_ , the RLJ REITs shall
be responsible for causing the completion of any work currently required
pursuant to existing PIPs, provided that if any     

such work is not completed by the Closing Date, the RLJ REITs shall give
Parent a credit in the amount of the cost of completing the uncompleted
existing PIP work, such cost to be determined in good faith by mutual
agreement of Parent and the Company Parties prior to the Closing Date, based
upon such reasonable construction estimates as the parties may obtain from
qualified contractors.

  

# 3. This Amendment may be executed and delivered in two or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission, each
of which shall be an original document and all of which together shall
constitute a single binding agreement.

  

# 4. Except as set forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall remain unchanged
and continue in full force and effect.

  

 ** _[remainder of page intentionally left blank]_**

        

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, constituting all of the parties to
the Merger Agreement, have caused their signatures to be set forth below as

Agreement, the " _First Amended Merger Agreement_ "), as amended by Amendment
No. 2 to the First Amended Agreement dated September 5, 2007 (" _Amendment
No. 2_" and, together with the First Amended Merger Agreement, the " _Second
Amended Merger Agreement_ ") and as amended by Amendment No. 3 to the

 ** _R_** _E_ _C_ _I_ _T_ _A_ _L_   _S_

  

A. Pursuant to Section 14.1 of the Merger Agreement, the parties to the
Merger Agreement may amend the Merger Agreement by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties to the Merger Agreement.

  

B. The parties to the Merger Agreement desire to amend certain provisions of
the Merger Agreement.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Merger Agreement shall be
and hereby is amended as follows:

  

# 1. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

# 2. Notwithstanding the termination of the Merger Agreement by its terms on
September 10, 2007, the parties to the Merger Agreement hereby agree to
reinstate the Merger Agreement and the Merger Agreement (as amended by
Amendment No. 1, Amendment No. 2, Amendment No. 3 and this Amendment) hereby
is reinstated.

  

# 3. The first sentence of Section 12.2(a) of the Merger Agreement shall be
and hereby is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

  

Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, until 5:00 p.m. EST on
October 15, 2007, to satisfy itself, in its sole and absolute discretion, of
all matters relating to the Merger Transactions, including, but not limited
to the condition and extent of the     

Properties and all matters related to the organization of the Company and any
entities owned and/or controlled by the Company (" _Due Diligence Period_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Due Diligence Period is subject to
extension as provided in _Section 3.2(a)_.  During that portion of the Due
Diligence Period following September 13, 2007, Parent shall diligently and in
good faith proceed as follows: (i) Parent shall conduct a thorough due
diligence review of all of the existing loan documents affecting the
Properties, which Parent acknowledges have been made available to Parent by
the Company Parties and (ii) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
and shall coordinate and cooperate with the Company Parties in an effort
(using diligence and dispatch) to obtain commitments from lenders to
restructure the existing debt on the Properties or to obtain new debt, as
determined by Parent and as may be acceptable to Parent, in an effort to
cause the principal amount of the debt on the Properties to be in the
aggregate amount of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the Company
Merger Consideration. If at any time during the Due Diligence Period, Parent
determines that it will not be able to proceed with the Contemplated
Transactions, Parent shall notify the Company Parties and terminate this
Merger Agreement and the Earnest Money Deposit, except for the Non-refundable
Down Payment, shall be returned to Parent and, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, no party hereto shall have any further liability
to any other party hereto pursuant to this Agreement.

  

# 4. The following sentence hereby is added to _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Merger
Agreement:

  

On or prior to September 14, 2007, Parent shall direct Escrow Agent to
disburse a portion of the Initial Earnest Money Deposit in the amount of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) to the Company Parties (the " _Initial
Non-refundable Down Payment_ "), and the Company Parties shall have received
the Initial Non-refundable Down Payment. The Due Diligence Period shall be
extended from until 5:00 pm EST on October 15, 2007, to until 5:00 pm EST on
October 29, 2007, if prior to 5:00 pm EST on October 15, 2007, Parent: (i)
shall direct Escrow Agent to disburse a portion of the Initial Earnest Money
Deposit in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00) to
the Company Parties (the " _Second Non-refundable Down Payment_ " and,
together with the Initial Non-refundable Down Payment, the " _Non-Refundable
Down Payment_ "), and the Company Parties shall have received the Second Non-
refundable Down Payment on or before 5:00 pm EST on October 16, 2007, and
(ii) notifies the Company Parties of Parents intention to extend the Due
Diligence Period until 5:00 pm EST on October 29, 2007. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including any provision providing
for the return of the Earnest Money Deposit to Parent), the Non-refundable
Down Payment shall be deemed fully earned by the Company Parties at the time
of payment and shall not be refundable to Parent under any circumstances, but
the Non-refundable Down Payment shall be a credit against the Company
Merger Consideration if Closing occurs.

  

# 5. This Amendment may be executed and delivered in two or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission, each
of which shall be an original document and all of which together shall
constitute a single binding agreement.

        

6. Except as set forth herein, the Merger Agreement shall remain unchanged and continue in full force and effect.
