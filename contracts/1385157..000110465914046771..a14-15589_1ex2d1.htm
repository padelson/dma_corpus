ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the " **Merger** ") with and into the Company in accordance with
the NJBCA and the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary
shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "
**Surviving Corporation** ").

 



 

(b) The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") shall take place in New
York City at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than
two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 (other
than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible under Applicable
Law, waiver of those conditions by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible under Applicable Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place or time as Parent and
the Company may mutually agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the "
**Closing Date** ").

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall (a) file a
certificate of merger with (i) the Department of Treasury of the State of New
Jersey and (ii) the Delaware Secretary of State and (b) make all other filings
or recordings required by the NJBCA or the DGCL in connection with the Merger
in such form as required by the NJBCA or the DGCL, as applicable. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " **Effective Time** ") as such
certificates of merger are duly filed with the Department of Treasury of the
State of New Jersey and the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time
as may be specified in such certificates of merger).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Agreement and the
NJBCA, including Section 14A:10-6 thereof, and the DGCL.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.02(c), each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive $86.00 in cash, without interest (the " **Merger
Consideration** "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other
than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation
such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of
Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c)).

 



 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a bank or trust reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
**Paying Agent** ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing Shares (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii)
uncertificated Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "), and Parent or one
of its Affiliates shall make available to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, cash in immediately available dollar-denominated funds
in the amounts and at the times necessary for the Paying Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.02(a) (such cash, the " **Exchange Fund**
"). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as dictated by Parent;
_provided_ that such investment shall only be made in (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by
either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors

 



      
 

 



 

Rating Services, or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination
of the foregoing. Any interest or income earned on the Exchange Fund, and any
amounts in the Exchange Fund in excess of the amounts payable under Section
2.02(a), shall be promptly paid to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.

 



 

(b) Promptly (and in any event within three Business Days) after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
holder of Shares at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for
use in such exchange. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share
represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE
2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by the applicable Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this ARTICLE 2.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority)
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. None of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person for
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Company Stock Options and Company RSUs_.

 



 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (or portion
thereof) to acquire Shares granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that became
vested and exercisable prior to, or the vesting and exercisability of which
will accelerate at, the Effective Time, in either case as required by the
terms of the applicable award agreement as in effect on the date hereof
(collectively, the " **Vested Options** "), shall be canceled, and, at or
promptly after the Effective Time (subject to Applicable Law, if the holder of
such canceled Vested Option is a Non-US Employee), the Company shall pay each
holder of any such canceled Vested Option an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such canceled Vested Option by (ii) the number of
Shares such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Vested
Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (or portion
thereof) to acquire Shares granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a
Vested Option (collectively, the " **Unvested Options** " and, together with
the Vested Options, the " **Company Stock Options** ") will be canceled in
exchange for the opportunity to receive solely an aggregate amount (an "
**Option Amount** ") in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such
canceled Unvested Option by (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have
purchased had such holder exercised such Unvested Option in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time (assuming that such Unvested Option were fully
exercisable). Each Option Amount will be payable in accordance with, and
subject to, Section 2.04(e).

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary,
if any, to provide that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
restricted Share unit granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that became vested
prior to, or the vesting of which will accelerate at, the Effective Time, in
either case as required by the terms of the applicable award agreement as in
effect on the date

 



      
 

 



 

hereof (collectively, the " **Vested RSUs** ") shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive from the Company at or promptly after
the Effective Time (subject to Applicable Law, if the holder of such Vested
RSU is a Non-US Employee) solely an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such
Vested RSU; _provided_ that for any such Vested RSU that constitutes deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such amount shall
be paid on the date(s) that it would be paid under the applicable Employee
Plan absent the application of this Section 2.04(c).

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary,
if any, to provide that, at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
restricted Share unit granted or issued pursuant to any Employee Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a Vested
RSU (collectively, the " **Unvested RSUs** " and, together with the Vested
RSUs, the " **Company RSUs** ") will be canceled in exchange for the
opportunity to receive solely an aggregate amount (an " **RSU Amount** ") in
cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the total
number of Shares subject to such Unvested RSU. Each RSU Amount shall be
payable in accordance with, and subject to, Section 2.04(e).

 



 

(e) Each Option Amount and each RSU Amount (each, a " **Retention Amount** ")
shall be payable to the holder of the applicable corresponding Unvested Option
or Unvested RSU, as applicable, in substantially equal installments on or
within 30 days after the date(s) (subject to Applicable Law, if such holder is
a Non-US Employee) on which such Unvested Option or Unvested RSU, as
applicable, was scheduled to become vested (each, a " **Vesting Date** "), in
each case subject to such holders continued employment with the Company or
any of its Affiliates through the applicable Vesting Date; _provided_ that, if
the employment of such holder is terminated by the Company or any of its
Affiliates without Cause at any time prior to the final Vesting Date
applicable to such Retention Amount, the entire unpaid portion of such
Retention Amount shall be paid to such holder on or within 30 days after such
termination (subject to Applicable Law, if such holder is a Non-US Employee)
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, on termination of the employment of such
holder for any reason other than by the Company or any of its Affiliates
without Cause at any time prior to such final Vesting Date, the entire unpaid
portion of such Retention Amount shall be forfeited without any payment to
such holder); _provided further_ that, if such RSU Amount constitutes deferred
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, such RSU Amount
shall be paid on the date(s) that it would be paid under the applicable
Employee Plan absent the application of this Section 2.04(c). Subject to the
second proviso in the preceding sentence, the Retention Amounts shall be
exempt from Section 409A of the Code and shall be administered so as to retain
such exemption.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain consents from holders of Company Stock

 



       
 

 



 

Options and Company RSUs and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of any
Employee Plan, Company Stock Option or Company RSU that, in the case of either
clauses (i) or (ii), are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.04; _provided_ that the Company shall not pay
any amounts (other than any payments pursuant to this Section 2.04) for such
consents without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section 2.04, payment may be withheld in respect of any
Company Stock Option or Company RSU until any such consent is obtained with
respect to such Company Stock Option or Company RSU.

 



 

Section 2.05. _Employee Stock Purchase Plan. _The Company shall take all
actions necessary under the Companys Amended and Restated 2006 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " **ESPP** ") to ensure that (i) participants may not
increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect
on the date of this Agreement, (ii) except for the offering period under the
ESPP that is in effect on the date hereof, no offering period shall be
authorized, continued or commenced following the date hereof, (iii) the ESPP
shall be terminated as of the tenth Business Day prior to the Effective Time,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and (iv) the rights of
participants in the ESPP with respect to the offering period under the ESPP
that is in effect on the date hereof shall be determined by treating the tenth
Business Day prior to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering
period (to the extent such date is prior to the date on which such offering
period would otherwise expire) and by making such other pro-rata adjustments
as may be necessary to reflect any shortening of the offering period but
otherwise treating such offering period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; _provided_ that (i) all
amounts allocated to each participants account under the ESPP at the end of
such offering period shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company
whole Shares at the applicable price under the ESPP for such offering period,
which Shares shall be canceled at the Effective Time in exchange for the right

Rights necessary to, or used or held for use in, the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as proposed to
be conducted in the Company SEC Documents. There exist no restrictions on the

otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right of any Person or (D)
alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Right of

any Person any offer to license any Intellectual Property Right of such Person
in connection with any actual or threatened claim of infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of any such Intellectual Property Right.

 



 

(iii) None of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights or the Licensed
Intellectual Property Rights have been adjudged invalid or unenforceable in
whole or part. All issued Patents, registered Trademarks and registered
Copyrights included in the Owned Intellectual Property Rights are, to the
knowledge of the Company, valid, enforceable, in full force and effect and
subsisting in all material respects and all registration, maintenance and

such items.

 



 

(iv) To the knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated any Owned Intellectual Property Right where such

been fully resolved by the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
taken reasonable steps in accordance with normal industry practice to maintain
the confidentiality of all Intellectual Property Rights of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, the value of which to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is contingent upon maintaining the confidentiality thereof, and,
to the knowledge of the Company, no such Intellectual Property Rights have
been disclosed other than to the Representatives of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, all of whom are bound by written confidentiality agreements that
protect such Intellectual Property Rights.

take commercially reasonable actions, consistent with current industry
standards, to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of the IT
Assets (and all information and transactions stored or contained therein or

modification or corruption, including but not limited to the implementation of
commercially reasonable (A) data backup, (B) disaster avoidance and recovery
procedures and (C) business continuity procedures.

its books or records in accordance with GAAP. Since the end of the last period
for which the Company and its Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their
respective books, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged

any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member) has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to the assessment or collection of

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries filed any amended Tax Return, entered
into any closing agreement, settled any Tax claim or assessment, or
surrendered any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax
liability.

over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, all Taxes that it was required to
withhold from any payment (including any dividend or interest payment) to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, vendor or other
Person,

 



      
 

 



 

other than any failure to do so which would not reasonably be expected to

subsequent period after the Effective Time.

knowledge, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result
in any such letter being revoked or not being issued or reissued or being
subject to a penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement Program if discovered
during an IRS audit or investigation. Each trust created under any such
Employee Plan is exempt

Code.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability for, and no Employee Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability, hospitalization,
life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or
former Service Provider (other than coverage mandated by Applicable Law). To

material excise Taxes or penalties against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,

would reasonably be expected to materially increase the expense of maintaining
such plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the
fiscal year ended on the Company Balance Sheet Date.

(as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan) and the amounts of the
Participants Compensation, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof
(and disregarding any deemed investment gains earned or losses suffered after
the date hereof with respect to such deferred Compensation), the estimated
Deferred Compensation Plan Liability as of December 31, 2014, rounded to the
nearest one million dollars, will be $200,000. As of the date hereof, no
Participant has deferred any Company RSUs under the Deferred Compensation
Plan.

 



 

(i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event, where such event would not alone have the effects described herein)
will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any payment or
benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or job security
payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other

any current or former Service Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service

such treatment in all material respects, and (iii) if required, to any extent,
to be funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully

forth, with respect to each employee of the Company or any of its

on by the Companys stockholders in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall
propose to be

 



      
 

 



 

acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, and subject to
Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall (a) give
Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices,
properties, assets, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries upon
reasonable prior notice, (b) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and
operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request
and (c) instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
cooperate with Parent in its reasonable investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may restrict the
foregoing access and the disclosure of information pursuant to this Section
6.03 to the extent that (A) any Applicable Law requires the Company or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information or (B) disclosure of any such information or document would result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that, with
respect to clauses (A) and (B) of this Section 6.03, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (1) develop an alternative to providing
such information that is reasonably acceptable to Parent or (2) enter into a
joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques if the parties
determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating such privilege. Any investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.03 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 



 

Section 6.04. _No_ _Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 



 

(a) (i) _General Prohibitions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize
or permit any of its or their officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors ("
**Representatives** ") to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or
knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that has
made, is seeking to make or could be reasonably expected to make an
Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent the Company Board

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or knowingly take any
action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (C), an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** "), (D) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) approve any business
combination under the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act or (F) enter
into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by
the Company.

 



 

(ii) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a)(i), at any time prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(A) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (1)
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third Party and its
Representatives that, subject to the Companys compliance with Section
6.04(a)(i), has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board reasonably believes is or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) furnish to such Third
Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with such
Third Party with terms in all material respects no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that, subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
providing for automatic amendment of the Standstill (as defined therein), such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any "standstill" provisions);
_provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third
Party; and

 



 

(B) subject to compliance with Section 6.04(a)(iv), the Company Board may, (i)
if an Intervening Event has occurred or in response to a Superior Proposal,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) in response to a Superior
Proposal, following an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with this
Agreement, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.01(d)(ii) in order to concurrently with or immediately after such
termination, enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that concurrently with any such termination, the

 



      
 

 



 

Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee required by Section 11.04;

 



 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) only if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under the NJBCA.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is
consistent with this Section 6.04; _provided_ that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action. It is understood and agreed that any factually accurate public
statement by the Company that merely describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
and contains a "stop, look and listen" communication (including pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the 1934 Act) shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change. The engagement in discussion and negotiation or
furnishing of information in accordance with Section 6.04(a)(ii)(A) shall not,
in themselves, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(iii) _Required Notices_. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no
event later than 48 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any meaningful indication that a
Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has made, is seeking to make or could
reasonably be expected to make an Acquisition Proposal, and the Company Board
shall not take any of the actions referred to in Section 6.04(a)(ii)(A) unless
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to take such action. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt and timely basis, of the status
and material details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.
The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify
the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any Acquisition
Proposal. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to
be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys compliance with
this Section 6.04(a)(iii).

 



 

(iv) _"Last Look"_. The Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(ii)(B) or exercise its termination rights
pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii) unless

 



      
 

 



 

(A) (i) if Company Board has determined that an applicable Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company promptly provides
written notice to Parent at least five Business Days (or two Business Days, in
the case of an amended, supplemented or modified Acquisition Proposal) before
taking such action of its intention to do so with a description of the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is
proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the
Acquisition Proposal (such notice, the " **Superior Proposal Notice** ") or
(ii) upon the occurrence of an Intervening Event, the Company promptly
provides written notice to Parent at least five Business Days before taking
such action of its intention to do so with a description of such Intervening
Event (such notice, the " **Intervening Event Notice** "), and (B) a period
commencing on the date that the Intervening Event Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice, as applicable, is deemed received by Parent pursuant to Section 11.01
and ending at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the fifth Business Day or second
Business Day thereafter, as applicable (the " **Notice Period** ") has elapsed
and Parent has not made a written proposal to amend the terms of this
Agreement to, as applicable, cause the Intervening Event to no longer form a
valid basis for the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(ii)(B) or to be at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable. It is
understood that, in the case of any action intended to be taken in
circumstances involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, any amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal
shall require a new written notification from the Company under this Section
6.04(a)(iv) and any material change to an Intervening Event shall be deemed to
be a new Intervening Event and result in a new Notice Period. The Company
agrees that, during the Notice Period, the Company and its Representatives
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding
any revisions proposed by Parent to the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Superior Proposal** " means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (replacing references to "25%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal with "more than 50%") on terms that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after considering the advice of an outside financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal is more
favorable and provides greater value to the Companys stockholders than is
provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(iv)), and which the
Company Board determines is reasonably likely to be consummated in a timely
manner and for which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in
part), is then fully committed by

 



      
 

 



 

reputable financing sources or reasonably determined to be available by the
Company Board.

 



 

(c) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Discussions_. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such Third Party (together with its Representatives) that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof
and that is in possession of confidential information heretofore furnished by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contain, reflect
or analyze that information) to return or destroy all such information as
promptly as practicable. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that,
during the 24-month period prior to the date hereof, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 6.05. _Section 16 Matters. _Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the 1934 Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act.

 



 

Section 6.06. _Stock Exchange Delisting; 1934 Act Deregistration. _Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the
deregistration of the Shares and other Company Securities under the 1934 Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten days after the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.07. _Takeover Statutes. _The Company shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions
necessary so that no "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium"
or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such
antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all actions necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take
all such other actions as

 



      
 

 



 

are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Stockholder Litigation_. From and after the date hereof, each
party hereto shall promptly advise the other parties orally and in writing of
any Proceedings (including derivative claims) commenced or, to the knowledge
of such party, threatened against such party and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and shall keep the other party fully informed regarding
any such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent (at Parents expense) the
opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense or settlement of
any such Proceeding and shall give due consideration to Parents views with
respect thereto. The Company shall not agree to any settlement of any such
Proceeding without Parents prior written consent.

Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
hereby agrees, to do the following:

 



 

(i) for six years after the Effective Time, subject to any limitation imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law, maintain in effect provisions in the
Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation)
regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in
favor of the present and former officers and directors of the Company (each,
an " **Indemnified Person** ") that are no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Persons than

 



      
 

 



 

the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) for six years after the Effective Time (and until the final resolution of
any matter for which indemnification is first sought hereunder prior to the
date which is six years after the Effective Time), indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or

pertaining to matters relating to such Indemnified Persons service as a

Effective Date, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Date, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law (and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance such expenses as

_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount (or, in the case of a prepaid policy described in clause (B),
an aggregate amount) in excess of 300% of the annual premium the Company paid
in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 7.04(a)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest

Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(b) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation

 



   

     
 

 



 

or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, Parent shall make proper provision so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

 



 

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
NJBCA or any other Applicable Law, or any agreement of any Indemnified Person
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Indemnified Person, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective
time, the provisions of this Section 7.04 shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.04 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by Contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Persons referred to in
this Section 7.04(e) in connection with their successful enforcement of their
rights provided in this Section 7.04.

**Continuing Employee** ," each Continuing Employee who is located primarily
within the United States is referred to herein as a " **US Employee** ," and
each Continuing Employee who is not a US Continuing Employee is referred to
herein as a " **Non-US Employee** ". For the period ending December 31, 2015
(or, if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall provide (or
cause to be provided) to each US Employee a level of base compensation and
employee benefits (other than cash incentive or equity or equity-based
compensation) that is substantially similar in the aggregate to the level of
base compensation and employee benefits (other than cash incentive or equity
or equity-based compensation) provided to such US Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the US Plans listed in Section 4.17(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. For the period ending December 31, 2014 (or,
if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall provide (or cause
to be provided) to each Non-US Employee a level of base compensation and
employee benefits (other than cash incentive or equity or equity-based
compensation) that is

employee benefits (other than cash incentive or equity or equity-based
compensation) provided to such Non-US Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the International Plans listed in Section 4.17(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or cause to be
provided) to each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and eligibility to
participate in employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible to participate (but
such service credit shall not be provided for benefit accrual purposes, except
for vacation and severance and employer contributions under 401(k) savings
plans, as applicable, except, in the case of any Non-US Employee, to the
extent that such service credit is required by Applicable Law or an applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement). In no event shall anything contained in this
Section 7.05(b) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. In addition, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A)
waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-
existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any
comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries applicable to such
Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time and (B) recognize (or cause to
be recognized), for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits
under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

 



 

(c) The Company shall take all actions that are necessary to cause each
Employee Plan that provides for annual cash bonuses for the performance period
that is scheduled to end on March 31, 2015 to provide instead that, contingent
on the occurrence of the Closing, such performance period shall end on the
later of September 30, 2014 and the Closing Date, and as soon as practicable
following the later of September 30, 2014 and the Effective Time, Parent shall
pay to each Continuing Employee who is then employed with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries a cash bonus for such shortened performance period in an
amount determined in accordance with Section 7.05(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided_ that the foregoing shall apply in the case of each Non-US
Employee only to the extent allowable by Applicable Law or an applicable
Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 



 

(d) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are
necessary to cause each Employee Plan set forth in Section 7.05(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to terminate effective as of no later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices or other
documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of
this Section 7.05(d) shall be subject to Parents prior review and approval.
The

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall promptly provide all information about the Continuing Employees
participation in the Employee Plans (including without limitation regarding
elections) that Parent reasonably requests to permit Parent to meet its
obligations pursuant to this Section 7.05.

 



 

(e) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that: (i) no individual who is not a Participant in the
Deferred Compensation Plan as of immediately prior to the date hereof shall
become a Participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan on or after the date
hereof; _provided_ that such restriction shall not apply with respect to any
individual who after the date hereof is hired without violating the
restriction set forth in Section 6.01(j)(v) to replace an individual who is a
Participant on the date thereof and whose employment terminates after the date
hereof without violating the restriction set forth in Section 6.01(j)(vi),
(ii) no Participant shall defer any Company RSUs under the Deferred
Compensation Plan, (iii) no Employer Credits shall be credited to the Deferred
Compensation Account of any Participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan
on or after the date hereof, (iv) no Trust Assets shall be contributed to the
Trust on or after the date, hereof, (v) if any Trust Assets are held in the
Trust on the date hereof, the amount of such Trust Assets that exceeds the
Deferred Compensation Plan Liability, in each case as determined in accordance
with GAAP as of such date, shall be promptly returned to the Company in
accordance with Section 1(g) of the Trust Agreement and (vi) the Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Trust Agreement shall not be materially amended on
or after the date hereof except as required to give effect to the terms set
forth in this Section 7.05(e).

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06(a), nothing in this
Section 7.05, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto, including any current or former Service
Provider, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an amendment,
termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish,
terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement,
(iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or
(iv) shall create any obligation on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to
employ or engage any Service Provider for any period following the Effective
Time.

Section 11.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent and
its Affiliates in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense
was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees that, unless there has been an intentional and material
breach of Section 6.04 or in the case of fraud, payment of the Termination Fee
as provided in Section 11.04(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to
an obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee and such remedy shall
be limited to the Termination Fee. In no circumstances shall the Company be
required to pay more than one termination fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b).

 



 

Section 11.05. _Company Disclosure Schedule, Company 10-K and Parent 10-K.

(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or

 



      
 

 



 

covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) other than with respect to
any reference in Section 4.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, any other
representations and warranties of such party that are contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in the Company
10-K (with respect to Article 4) or the Parent 10-K (with respect to Article
5) shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) the Companys or Parents representations and warranties, as
the case may be, if the relevance of that information as an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

 



 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided
in Section 7.04, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any

Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or

hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, (i) to one or more of its Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 



 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. Except to the extent the provisions of the
NJBCA are mandatorily applicable to the Merger, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 



 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction. _(a) The parties hereto agree that any
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising

hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware

 



      
 

 



 

or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any such court or
that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto irrevocably consents and agrees that any such action
arising out of or relating to Parents financing sources shall be brought only
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of
Manhattan, or, if under applicable laws exclusive jurisdiction is vested in
the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Process in any such Proceeding may
be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 



 

(b) EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY DESIGNATES
THE CORPORATION TRUST COMPANY (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE " **PROCESS AGENT** "),
WITH AN OFFICE AT 1209 ORANGE STREET, WILMINGTON, DELAWARE 19801, AS ITS

OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND SUCH

_PROVIDED_ THAT IN THE CASE OF ANY SUCH SERVICE UPON THE PROCESS AGENT, THE
PARTY EFFECTING SUCH SERVICE SHALL ALSO DELIVER A COPY THEREOF TO EACH OTHER
SUCH PARTY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN SECTION 11.01 OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY SHALL TAKE ALL SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONTINUE SAID
APPOINTMENT IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT SO THAT SUCH

PURPOSES IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY
PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH PARTY
EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE
UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 



 

Section 11.09. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS

 



      
 

 



 

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE ARRANGEMENT OF FINANCING RELATED TO THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT).

 



 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance. _The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that, except where this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.01, the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in the courts referred to in Section 11.08(a), without proof of actual damages
(and each party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 11.14. _Joint and Several Liability; Obligation of Parent_. Parent and
Merger Subsidiary hereby agree that they will be jointly and severally liable
for all covenants, agreements, obligations and representations and warranties
made by either of them in the Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Subsidiary to
take such action and a guarantee of the payment and performance thereof.

 



 

Section 11.15. _Financing Sources_. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
no party shall have any right or claim (whether based in contract, tort,
strict liability or any other theory of liability) against Parents financing
sources in connection with this Agreement, the arrangement of financing
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notwithstanding anything to
the contract set forth in this Agreement, Parents financing sources are
intended beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to enforce, Sections
11.08(a), 11.09 and this Section 11.15.
