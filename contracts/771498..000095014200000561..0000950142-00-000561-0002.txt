                  This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") dated as
of June 21, 2000, among Newmont Mining Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Bounty Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Sub") and Battle Mountain Gold Company, a Nevada
corporation (the "Company").

                  WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of the Company ( "Company Common Stock"), not owned directly or
indirectly by Parent or the Company, will be converted into the right to receive
0.105 (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(d), the "Conversion Number") of a
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.60 per share,
of Parent ("Parent Common Stock");

                  WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the form of Arrangement Agreement, dated the date
hereof, attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement (the "Canadian Arrangement
Agreement"), each issued and outstanding exchangeable share of Battle Mountain
Canada Ltd. ("Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares"), other than those owned
directly or indirectly by the Company or by holders of Canadian Co. Exchangeable
Shares who validly exercise rights of dissent, will be exchanged for the right
to receive the Conversion Number of a fully paid and nonassessable share of
Parent Common Stock (the "Canadian Arrangement");

                  WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the Canadian Arrangement and also to prescribe various conditions to
the Merger and the Canadian Arrangement; and

                  WHEREAS, for accounting purposes, it is intended that the
Merger be accounted for as a pooling of interests under United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                       The Merger and Canadian Arrangement

                  SECTION 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Nevada
General Corporation Law (including Chapter 92A thereof, the "NGCL"), Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time of the Merger.
Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"), and shall succeed to and assume all the rights, properties,
liabilities and obligations of Sub in accordance with the NGCL. At the election
of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be
substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger or Ca-

nadian Sub in the Canadian Arrangement; provided that such substitution does not
adversely affect the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock or Canadian
Co. Exchangeable Shares under this Agreement or the Canadian Arrangement
Agreement (or unless the Company shall otherwise consent to such substitution,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). In such event, the parties agree
to execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
substitution.

                  SECTION 1.2. Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place as soon as reasonably practicable after satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI capable of being satisfied prior to the
Closing, but in any event no later than the fifth business day after such time
(the "Closing Date"), at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

                  SECTION 1.3. Effective Time of the Merger. Upon the Closing,
the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada
articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
"Articles of Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
NGCL, and shall make all other filings, recordings or publications required
under the NGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Nevada Secretary
of State, or at such other time as the parties may agree and specify in the
Articles of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time
of the Merger").

                  SECTION 1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the

                  SECTION 1.5. Articles of Incorporation and By-laws. (a) The
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
option of the Parent, the Articles of Incorporation of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except for Article I thereof, which
shall continue to read "The name of the corporation is `Battle Mountain Gold
Company'," until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.

                  (b) The By-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

                  SECTION 1.6. Directors. The individuals who are the directors

                  SECTION 1.7. Officers. The individuals who are the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger shall be the

                  SECTION 1.8. Additional Actions. If, at any time after the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other
acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company, or (b) otherwise
carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall be deemed to have
granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute
and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to take all
acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and
possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company
or otherwise to take any and all such action.

                  SECTION 1.9. Plan of Arrangement. Contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, Parent, Sub, the Company and Battle Mountain Canada
Ltd., an Ontario corporation and a subsidiary of the Company ("Canadian Co.")
shall execute and enter into the Canadian Arrangement Agreement under which the
Canadian Arrangement shall be effected at the Effective Time of the Merger
pursuant to the Canadian Arrangement Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the
Canadian Arrangement Agreement, Parent may effect the Canadian Arrangement

wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Canadian Sub").

action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Sub:

                  (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of

<PAGE>

                  (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section
2.3(e), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Conversion Number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock. As of the Effective Time of the Merger, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive upon
the surrender of such certificates, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends to the extent provided in Section 2.3(c) to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.3, without interest.

                  (d) Adjustment of Conversion Number. In the event that, prior
to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall declare or set a record date
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger for a stock dividend or other
distribution payable in Parent Common Stock or securities convertible into
Parent Common Stock, or effect or set a record date prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger for a stock split, reclassification, combination or other change
with respect to Parent Common Stock, the Conversion Number shall be adjusted to
reflect such dividend, distribution, stock split, reclassification, combination
or other change.

                  SECTION 2.2. Effect on Capital Stock of Canadian Co. and
Canadian Sub. As of the effective time of the Canadian Arrangement (which shall
be simultaneous with the Effective Time of the Merger), the effect on the shares
of capital stock of Canadian Sub and Canadian Co. will be as provided for in
accordance with the Canadian Arrangement Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.3. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent.
Immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, (i) Parent shall deposit
with ChaseMellon Shareholder Services LLC or such other bank or trust company as
may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, and (ii) Parent (or at Parent's option, Canadian Sub) shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Canadian Co. Exchangeable
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange
Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares
of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger, the
"Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 and 2.2 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or outstanding Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares, other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled or retired in accordance with Section
2.1(b) and other than Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares that are not to be
exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Canadian Arrangement
(the "Certificates") , (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be

                                       -4-
<PAGE>

in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II or the Canadian Arrangement
Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Canadian Co.
Exchangeable Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or Canadian Co., a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the certificate representing the appropriate number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to the extent provided in Section 2.3(e) and any dividends to the
extent provided in Section 2.3(c). No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Any
amounts payable or deliverable pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to
and made net of applicable withholding taxes to the extent such taxes are
imposed under applicable law as determined by Parent in its reasonable
discretion.

                  (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(e), until the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e),
and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time of the Merger theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of
the Merger but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or
Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3(c) or 2.3(e)) shall
be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satis-

                                       -5-
<PAGE>

faction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or
Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation or Canadian Co. of the shares of Company
Common Stock or Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares, respectively, which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (other than
Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares held by Parent, Canadian Co., Canadian Sub, the
Company or any wholly owned subsidiary of any of them or any of their
transferees). If, after the Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Canadian Co. or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II, except as otherwise provided by law. Certificates surrendered for exchange
by any person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule
145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received written undertakings from such person in the form attached
as Exhibit B to this Agreement.

                  (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent.

                  (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time
of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) over (B) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of the Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders
of the Certificates, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then-prevailing prices
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") all in the manner provided in
Section 2.3(e)(iii).

                  (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent
shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The proceeds from
such sale or sales available for distribution to the holders of Certificates
shall be reduced by the compensation payable to the Exchange Agent and the
expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent, in each case, in connection with such
sale or sales of the Excess Shares, including all related commissions, transfer
taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs. Until the net proceeds of such
sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of the Certificates, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of the
Certificates (the "Common Shares Trust"). The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of a Certificate shall
be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of a Certificate is
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
share interests to which all holders of the Certificates are entitled.

                  (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates in lieu of any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent

                                       -6-
<PAGE>

shall make available such amounts, without interest, to such holders of
Certificates who have surrendered their Certificates in accordance with this
Article II.

                  (f) Termination of Exchange Fund and Common Shares Trust. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund and Common Shares Trust which remains undistributed
to the holders of Certificates for six months after the Effective Time of the
Merger shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.

                  (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund or the Common Shares Trust delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time of the Merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                  (h) Investment of Exchange Fund and Common Shares Trust. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund and Common
Shares Trust, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent; provided that
any losses shall be solely for Parent's account.

                  SECTION 2.4. Assumption of Company Stock Options. (a) The
Company shall take all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time of the
Merger, all Company Stock Options that are then outstanding and unexercised
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock or
Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares and shall be converted automatically into
options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall assume each
such Company Stock Option subject to the terms of the Company Employee Stock
Plans or Canadian Co. Employee Stock Plans under which each such Company Stock
Option was issued; provided, however, that, from and after the Effective Time of
the Merger, (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares that were purchasable
under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger multiplied by the Conversion Number, rounding to the nearest whole share,
and (B) the per share exercise price under each such Company Stock Option shall
be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of each such Company Stock
Option by the Conversion Number, rounded to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the number of shares and the per share exercise price of each
Company Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code")) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of

                                       -7-
<PAGE>

the Code. Similarly, the number of shares and the per share exercise price of
each Canadian Co. Stock Option or in respect of any other stock based award
granted under Canadian Co. Employee Stock Plans shall be adjusted in accordance
with subsection 7(1.4) of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Accordingly, with respect
to any incentive stock options, Canadian Co. Stock Options or stock based awards
granted under the Canadian Co. Employee Stock Plans, fractional shares shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares and where necessary the per
share exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

                  (b) At or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent
shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary
to satisfy Parent's obligations under this Section 2.4. Not later than 60 days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to options to acquire Parent Common Stock issued pursuant
to this Section 2.4.

                  SECTION 2.5. Effect on Company Convertible Preferred Stock. At
the Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of any shares of $3.25 Convertible Preferred Stock of
the Company ("Company Convertible Preferred Stock"):

                  (a) Each share of Company Convertible Preferred Stock that is
owned by the Company or by Parent shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

                  (b) Each share of Company Convertible Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (other
than shares to be cancelled under Section 2.5(a)) shall be converted,
automatically and without the requirement of any exchange of any certificate
representing such share, into one share of preferred stock of Parent to be
designated as the $3.25 Convertible Preferred Stock of Parent ("Parent
Convertible Preferred Stock") with the rights and preferences set forth in the
form of the Certificate of Designation attached as Exhibit D to this Agreement.
The terms of the Parent Convertible Preferred Stock shall be substantively
identical to the terms of the Company Convertible Preferred Stock, except for
changes required by applicable law and except that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock into which each such share of Parent Convertible Preferred
Stock may be converted, under the terms thereof, shall be calculated based on an
initial Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the
Company Convertible Preferred Stock) of $10.50 divided by the Conversion Number.

                  (c) All Company Convertible Preferred Stock converted into
Parent Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time of the Merger, and each certificate previously
representing any such Company Convertible Preferred Stock shall as of the
Effective Time of the Merger be deemed to represent as of the Effective Time of
the Merger the number of shares of Parent Convertible Preferred Stock equal to
the number of shares of Company Convertible Preferred Stock previously
represented by such certificate. At the request of any holder of a certificate
previously representing any such Company Convertible Preferred Stock, and upon

                                       -8-
<PAGE>

surrender of such certificate with such other documents as Parent may reasonably
request, Parent will issue a new certificate representing a number of shares of
Parent Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Company
Convertible Preferred Stock previously represented by such certificate.

                  SECTION 2.6. Effect on Company Special Voting Stock. As of the
Effective Time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any share or shares of special voting stock, par value
$0.10 per share ("Company Special Voting Stock") of the Company, each share of
Company Special Voting Stock shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

                  SECTION 2.7. Convertible Notes. In connection with the Merger,
the Company shall take all actions required to be taken by it under the Fiscal
Agency Agreement, dated January 4, 1990, between the Company and Citibank, N.A.
(the "Convertible Notes Agreement"), prior to consummation of the Merger. In
addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take all
actions required to be taken under the Convertible Notes Agreement following
consummation of the Merger.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

                  SECTION 3.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company.
The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

                  (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries (each a "Company Subsidiary") is a corporation,
partnership or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.
Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would
not (i) have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than as a result of or effects
relating directly to (A) general economic conditions or (B) changes in or
affecting the gold mining industry in general), or (ii) prevent the Company from
performing its obligations on a timely basis under this Agreement (a "Company
Material Adverse Effect"). The Company has made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-laws
of the Company and the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable
organization documents of the Company Significant Subsidiaries, in each case, as
amended to the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Company Significant Subsidiary" means any Company Subsidiary that constitutes a
significant subsidiary of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of

                                       -9-
<PAGE>

Regulation S-X of the SEC. The Company is not in violation of any provision of
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company,
and no Company Subsidiary is in violation of any provisions of its certificate
of incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational documents, except to the
extent that such violations would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Company Subsidiaries. Section 3.1(b) of the letter from
the Company, dated the date of this Agreement, addressed to Parent (the "Company
Disclosure Letter") lists each Company Subsidiary (other than joint ventures
that are immaterial to the current and contemplated operation of the Company)
and the ownership interest therein of the Company. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, are owned by the Company, by another subsidiary of the
Company or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all
pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind
or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"). Except for the capital stock of
the Company Subsidiaries and except for the ownership interests set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest, with a
fair market value as of the date of this Agreement greater than $1,000,000, in
any person.

                  (c) Capital Structure.

                  (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company ("Company
Capital Stock") consists of (A) 500,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, (B)
50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share and (C) one
share of Company Special Voting Stock. Pursuant to a Resolution Establishing
Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, the Board of Directors of the Company created a series of 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock," par value $1.00 per share ("Company Series A Preferred Stock"), which
shares are issuable in connection with the rights to purchase shares of Company
Series A Preferred Stock (the "Company Rights") that were issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of November 10, 1988, as amended and restated as of
July 19, 1996, as further amended effective November 10, 1998, between the

of Company Common Stock were outstanding, 2,299,980 shares of Company

Disclosure Letter, there are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other

exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company must vote. Except for the 6% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due 2005 of the Company (the "Convertible Notes") or as
set forth above and except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are not any options,
warrants, puts, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or

in, or securities convertible or exchangeable for any capital stock or other

fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has previously provided Parent with a

the extent otherwise required pursuant to Section 6.2(2) or 7.2(2) of the
provisions of the Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares).

                  (ii) The issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital
stock described in this Section 3.1(c) have been in compliance in all material
respects with applicable securities laws. Except in respect of the Canadian Co.
Exchangeable Shares or as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure

Letter, the Company has not agreed to register any securities under the

under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that such

Co. by such Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities (the

legislation in each applicable province and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. None of the Canadian Securities Documents, as of their
respective dates, contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except to the extent that such statements have been

consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents (as amended prior to the date hereof) and Canadian Securities
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC and

SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented the consolidated financial
position of the Company as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to
the informational reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file
any form, report or other document with the SEC, the NYSE, any other stock
exchange or any other comparable Governmental Entities.

                  (f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC by Parent in

with the SEC, or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company's
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, and (iii) the management information circular of the
Canadian Co. relating to the Canadian Arrangement (the "Canadian Proxy
Statement") will, at the date the Canadian Proxy Statement is first mailed to
the Canadian Co.'s shareholders or at the time of the meeting of such
shareholders at which the Canadian Arrangement is considered, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Canadian Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable Canadian provincial corporate and securities
legislation and the regulations, rules and published policy statements
promulgated thereunder (subject, as applicable, to the Relief), except that no
representation or warranty is made by the Company or the Canadian Co. with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or the Canadian Proxy Statement.

prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the Merger or the

                  (i) Employee Benefit Plans. (i) For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms have the definitions given below:

                  "Controlled Group Liability" means any and all liabilities (i)

         to, the Employee Benefit Plans listed in Section 3.1(i) of the Company
         Disclosure Letter.

                  "Employee Benefit Plan" means any employee benefit plan,

         any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or

         Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries

         any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of

         compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, severance,

                  "Withdrawal Liability" means liability to a Multiemployer Plan
         as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such Multiemployer
         Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of
         ERISA.

                  (ii) Section 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter includes
a complete list of all Employee Benefit Plans and all Material Employment
Agreements.

                  (iii) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of: (A) each writing
constituting a part of such Plan, including without limitation all plan
documents, material employee communications, benefit schedules, trust
agreements, and insurance contracts and other funding vehicles; (B) the most
recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (C)
the current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if
any (in each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (D) the
most recent annual financial report, if any; (E) the most recent actuarial
report, if any; and (F) the most recent determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service, if any. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a
true, complete and correct copy of each Material Employment Agreement. Except as
specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered or made available to
Parent, there are no amendments to any Plan or Material Employment Agreement
that have been adopted or approved nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any
new Plan or Material Employment Agreement.

                  (iv) Section 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
identifies each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("Qualified Plans"). The Internal Revenue
Service has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, and, to the
Company's knowledge, there are no circumstances and no events have occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Qualified Plan or the related trust. Section 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter identifies each Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, and each such plan meets such requirements and
provides no disqualified benefits (as such term is defined in Section 4976(b) of
the Code).

                  (v) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(v) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, all contributions required to be made to any Plan by
applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies
funding any Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made
or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the financial statements included
in the Filed Company SEC Documents and there are no grantor trusts providing for
funding of amounts payable pursuant to any Plans and/or Material Employment
Agreements. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan
under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either (A) funded through an insurance company
contract (and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the meaning of Section 419 of
the Code) or (B) unfunded.

                  (vi) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all
material respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and
regulations applicable to such Employee Benefit

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

Plans and each Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. There is not now, nor, to the Company's
knowledge, do any circumstances exist that could give rise to, any requirement
for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the imposition of any lien
on the assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under ERISA or
the Code.

                  (vii) With respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (A) there does not
exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of
the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (B) no reportable event
within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this agreement will not result in the occurrence of
any such reportable event; (C) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full; (D) no liability (other
than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected
to be incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and (E) the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Plan and, to the
Company's knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Plan.

                  (viii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(viii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter: (A) no Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan
or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a
"Multiple Employer Plan"); (B) none of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last
six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (C) none of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that
has not been satisfied in full. With respect to each Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan, except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(viii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter: (A) if the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or partial
withdrawal from such plan, no Withdrawal Liability would be incurred; and (B)
none of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has received any notification, nor has any reason to believe,
that any such Plan is in reorganization, has been terminated, is insolvent, or
may reasonably be expected to be in reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be
terminated.

                  (ix) There does not now exist, nor, to the Company's
knowledge, do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a material liability of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

                  (x) Section 3.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
(A) a complete list of each Employee Benefit Plan or Material Employment
Agreement under which the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment
or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or could limit the right of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
from any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust or any Material Employment
Agreement or related trust, and (B) the maximum amount of the "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could become
payable by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (xi) None of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries nor, to
the Company's knowledge, any other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged
in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA), which would reasonably be expected to subject any of the
Employee Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any person that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

                  (xii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i)(xii) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there are no pending or threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted, and to the Company's knowledge, no set of
circumstances exists which would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim
or lawsuit, against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Plans
which would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the Department of
Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Plan or any
participant in a Plan.

Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. There are no liens with respect
to Taxes upon any of the properties or assets, real or personal, tangible or

Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither the

arrangement required or permitted by law) binding the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that (A) requires the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to make any material Tax payment to or for the account of any other
person, (B) affords any other person the benefit of any net operating loss, net
capital loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or
any other credit or Tax attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without
limitation, deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) of the

                  (v) The Company is not and has not been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code
during the applicable period described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section
355 of the Code (A) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement (or
will constitute such a corporation in the two years prior to the date of the
Effective Time of the Merger) or (B) in a distribution which otherwise

excise and property taxes, and Nevada net proceeds of mine and other similar
taxes, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect thereto and
(B) any obligations under any agreements or arrangements with respect to any
taxes described in clause (A) above.

                  (n) Compliance with Laws. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity
applicable to its business or operations, except for violations and failures to
comply that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o) Accounting Matters. Neither the Company nor, to its best
knowledge, any of its affiliates, has taken or agreed to take any action that
(without giving effect to any action taken or agreed to be taken by Parent or
any of its affiliates) would prevent Parent from accounting for the business
combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests. The Company
does not have actual knowledge of any other reason that would prevent Parent
from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a
pooling of interests.

                  (p) Title to and Condition of Properties. (i) Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has good and marketable title (applying

and each of the Company Subsidiaries is in generally good repair and is
operational and usable in the operation of the Company, subject to normal wear
and tear and technical obsolescence, except for such property whose failure to
be in such condition would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (iii) The Company has delivered to or made available for
inspection by Parent all material Existing Data in its possession or control,
and true and correct copies of all material leases or other material contracts

         nor causing or permitting any condition which is reasonably likely to
         result in the creation of any Environmental Liabilities;

         otherwise has an interest, nor any past creation of damage or
         threatened damage on, about or in the general vicinity of any such
         property which is reasonably likely to result in the creation of any
         Environmental Liabilities; and

                           (C) the Company has not received inquiry from or
         notice of a pending investigation from any Governmental Entity or of
         any administrative or judicial proceeding concerning the violation of

the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has any collective bargaining agreements or similar labor contracts
with any persons employed by the Company or any persons otherwise performing
services primarily for the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company
Business Personnel"). Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has engaged in any unfair labor practice with respect to the Company Business
Personnel since January 1, 1997, and there is no unfair labor practice complaint
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company or
any of its subsidiaries with respect to the Company Business Personnel. Except

labor strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has experienced any material labor
strike, dispute, slowdown or stoppage or other labor difficulty involving its

                  (s) MSHA, OSHA Matters. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the requirements of each of the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and any similar laws or regulations of any
foreign, state or local jurisdiction (collectively, the "Safety Acts"), except
for any non-compliance which could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since
January 1, 1997, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
citation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration or any other Governmental Entity or any inspector
setting forth any respect in which the facilities or operations of the Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries are not in compliance with the Safety Acts,
or the regulations under such acts which noncompliance has not been corrected or
remedied to the satisfaction of such Governmental Entity or inspector, except in

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has previously made available to Parent all written citations heretofore
issued to the Company under the Safety Acts and all material correspondence
related thereto since January 1, 1997, and shall within one month of the date
hereof provide Parent with copies of all such written citations and material
correspondence related thereto.

                  (t) State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of the
Company has approved, and has adopted a bylaw amendment with respect to, the
Merger and this Agreement and the Support/Voting Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof by and between Parent, Noranda Inc. and the Company (the "Voting/Support
Agreement") and such approval and adoption is sufficient to render inapplicable
to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Voting/Support Agreement), the provisions of Sections
78.378 to 78.3793 and Sections 78.411 to 78.444 of the NGCL. To the best of the

action to (i) render the Company Rights and Canadian Co. Rights inapplicable to

this Agreement (including the Vot-

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

ing/Support Agreement) and (ii) ensure that (A) neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates is an Acquiring Person (as defined in either the Company Rights
Agreement or Canadian Co. Rights Agreement) and (B) none of a Distribution Date,
Shares Acquisition Date or Triggering Event (each as defined in either the

of the approval, execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Canadian
Arrangement Agreement, the announcement or consummation of the Merger, the
consummation of the Canadian Arrangement or the consummation of any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Voting/Support
Agreement).

                  (v) Dispositions of Company Property. Except as described in
the Filed Company SEC Documents or in Section 3.1(v) of the Company Disclosure

personal property (other than dispositions in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), real property, any interest or rights with
respect to real property (including exploration or production rights), any
participating interest in a joint venture or other assets or properties of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary ("Company Assets"), other than sales and

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, as amended
prior to the date hereof, except for (i) such reductions in reserves that have
resulted from production in the ordinary course of business and (ii) such
reductions in mineralized material that have resulted from reclassifications of
mineralized material as reserves.

                  (x) Development Projects. The Company has no reason to
believe, subject to the receipt of necessary permits and approvals which the
Company reasonably expects as of the date of this Agreement, that (i) the
estimated production capacity for each of the time periods set forth in Section

described therein will not be reached during such time periods, or (ii) the
estimated costs set forth in Section 3.1(x) of the Company Disclosure Letter
with respect to each such development project will be materially exceeded.

                  SECTION 3.2. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub.
Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

                  (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of
Parent, Sub and Canadian Sub is, or in the case of Canadian Sub, to the extent
not formed, will be, a corporation, partnership or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite power and authority
to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Parent, Sub and
Canadian Sub and each of Parent's subsidiaries (each a "Parent Subsidiary") is,
or in the case of Canadian Sub, to the extent not formed, will be, duly
qualified or li-

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

censed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed (individually or in the aggregate) would
not (i) have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than as a result of or effects
relating directly to (A) general economic conditions or (B) changes in or
affecting the gold mining industry in general), or (ii) prevent Parent from
performing its obligations on a timely basis under this Agreement (a "Parent
Material Adverse Effect").

                  (b) Parent Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of each Parent Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and, except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the letter from the
Parent, dated the date of this Agreement, addressed to the Company (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter"), are owned by Parent, by another subsidiary of Parent or by
Parent and another Parent Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens.

                  (c) Capital Structure.

                  (i) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of Parent ("Parent Capital Stock") consists of
250,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $5.00 per share ("Parent Preferred Stock"). Pursuant to a
Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the First Series of the
Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share, filed on September 11, 1990, the
Board of Directors of Parent created a series of 370,000 shares of preferred
stock designated as the "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock", par
value $5.00 per share ("Parent Series A Preferred Stock"). The shares of Parent
Series A Preferred Stock are issuable in connection with the rights to purchase
shares of Parent Series A Preferred Stock (the "Parent Rights") that were issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated August 30, 1990 (as amended from time to
time, the "Parent Rights Agreement"), between Parent and The Chase Manhattan
Bank, as successor corporation. At the close of business on June 19, 2000: (A)
168,078,765 shares of Parent Common Stock were outstanding, all of which were
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no shares of Parent Series A
Preferred Stock, or of any other series of Parent Preferred Stock, were
outstanding; (B) 146,615 shares of Parent Common Stock were held by Parent in
its treasury; (C) 14,591,613 shares of Parent Common Stock were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding employee stock options (the "Parent
Employee Stock Options") that were granted in each case pursuant to the Parent's
employee stock plans set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter
(the "Parent Employee Stock Plans"); and (D) 370,000 shares of Parent Series A
Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the Parent Rights.
Except as set forth above or in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
at the close of business on June 19, 2000, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Parent were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there are
not any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Parent having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company must vote.
Except as set forth above and except as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are not any
Options to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
them is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, or obli-

                                      -29-

gating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue, transfer, grant, sell or pay
for or repurchase any shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or
securities convertible or exchangeable for any capital stock or other equity
interests in, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or obligating Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such Options. All shares of
Parent Common Stock that are subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on
the terms and conditions specified in the instrument pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
All shares of Parent Common Stock that are subject to issuance pursuant to the
Merger and the Canadian Arrangement, upon issuance pursuant to this Agreement
and the Canadian Arrangement Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. The authorized capital stock of Sub consists of
1000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 shares of which have
been validly issued, and fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent
free and clear of any Lien. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are not any
outstanding contractual obligations or other requirements of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Canadian Sub consists or will consist
of 1,000 common shares, all of which have been or will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are or will be owned by Company free and clear of any
Liens.

                  (ii) The issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital
stock described in this Section 3.2(c) have been in compliance in all material
respects with United States federal and state securities laws.

                  (d) Authority; Noncontravention. Parent and Sub have all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Canadian Sub has
all requisite corporate power to enter into the Canadian Arrangement Agreement
and, subject to the approval of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Canadian Arrangement Agreement.
The Board of Directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent is or shall be the sole
holder of all Common Shares of Canadian Sub and has or shall consent to and
approve the Canadian Arrangement Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the Canadian Arrangement Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case by Parent or by Parent and Sub, as the case may be, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub, and
no vote of the holders of any class or series of Parent Capital Stock is
necessary in connection therewith. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Sub, respectively, and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Sub, respectively, enforceable against each such party
in accordance with its terms. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(d) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Canadian Arrangement Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement or the Canadian Arrangement Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of consent, termination, purchase,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of any property,
rights or benefits under, or result in the imposition of any additional
obligation under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent, Sub or

                                      -30-
<PAGE>

any other Parent Subsidiary under, (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or By-laws of Parent, the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of Sub, or the
comparable organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) any Contract

3.2(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, any judgment, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Parent, Sub or any other Parent
Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or
Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by
or with respect to Parent, Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub, as the case may
be, or the consummation by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (i) the filing with the
SEC of (A) the Proxy Statement the Form S-4, and related filings under the
Securities Act and (B) such reports under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as
may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the Nevada Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to do business, (iii)
those that may be required solely by reason of the Company's (as opposed to any
other third party's) participation in the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the necessary filings, notices, approvals,
confirmations, consents, declarations and/or decisions under antitrust laws,

Environmental Laws, (A) as may be required under the laws of any foreign country
in which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary conducts any business or owns any
property or assets, (B) as are set forth in Section 3.2(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter or (C) that, if not obtained or made, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e) SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. Parent has filed
all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the
SEC since January 1, 1997 (the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of its date, each
Parent SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents. None of the Parent SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that such
statements have been modified or superseded by a later-filed Parent SEC
Document. The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed
or reserved against on the balance sheet of Parent as of De-

                                      -31-

after the date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior
practice and not prohibited by this Agreement or (iii) as set forth in Section
3.2(e) to the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent does not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due, that, individually or
in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
(i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any
time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Proxy Statement will, at the date
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Company's Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (iii) the
management information circular of the Canadian Co. relating to the Canadian
Proxy Statement will, at the date the Canadian Proxy Statement is first mailed
to the Canadian Co.'s shareholders or at the time of the meeting of such
shareholders at which the Canadian Arrangement is considered, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
Act, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Sub with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form S-4.

                  (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed
in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of
this Agreement (the "Filed Parent SEC Documents"), since December 31, 1999,
Parent has conducted its business only in the ordinary course, and:

                  (i) since December 31, 1999, there has not been any event,
change, effect or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, is likely to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect;

                  (ii) since December 31, 1999 through the date of this
Agreement, there has not been except for regular quarterly dividends not in
excess of $0.03 per share of Parent Common Stock, with customary record and
payment dates, any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any
shares of Parent Capital Stock;

                  (iii) since December 31, 1999 through the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any split, combination or reclassification of any
Parent Capital Stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any
other securities in exchange or in substitution for shares of Parent Capital
Stock except as set forth in Section 3.2(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter;

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

                  (iv) since December 31, 1999, there has not been any change in
accounting methods, principles or practices by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
materially affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except insofar as may
have been required by a change in GAAP; and

                  (v) since December 31, 1999 through the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in any action
which, if done after the date of this Agreement, would violate Section 4.1(c),
except as set forth in Section 3.2(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

                  (h) Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Filed Parent SEC
Documents or in Section 3.2(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there is no
suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and there
is not any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary having,
or that would be reasonably expected to have, any Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, except as disclosed in the Filed
Parent SEC Documents or in Section 3.2(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, there
is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay in any material
respect the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (i) Brokers. Except for Goldman, Sachs & Co., Inc., no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Sub.

                  (j) Compliance with Laws. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity
applicable to its business or operations, except for violations and failures to
comply that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) Accounting Matters. Neither Parent nor, to its best
knowledge, any of its affiliates, has taken or agreed to take any action that
(without giving effect to any action taken or agreed to be taken by the Company
or any of its affiliates) would prevent Parent from accounting for the business
combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests. Parent does
not have actual knowledge of any other reason that would prevent Parent from
accounting for the business combination to be effected by the Merger as a
pooling of interests.

                  (l) Interim Operations of Sub and Canadian Sub. Sub and
Canadian Sub were formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and have not engaged in any business activities
or conducted any operations other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (m) Absence of Reduction in Reserves and Mineralized Material.
There has been no material reduction in the aggregate amount of

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from the amounts set forth in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K of Parent for the year ended December 31, 1999, except for
(i) such reductions in reserves that have resulted from production in the
ordinary course of business and (ii) such reductions in mineralized material
that have resulted from reclassifications of mineralized material as reserves.

contractors to effectuate the foregoing as promptly as practicable.

                  (c) Conduct of Business by Parent. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and to
retain the services of its officers and key employees and maintain relationships
with customers, suppliers, lessees, joint venture partners, licensees and other
third parties to the end that their goodwill and ongoing business shall not be
impaired in any material respect. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time of the Merger, except as set forth in Section
4.1(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

Parent shall not (i) make any amendment to the Parent Certificate of
Incorporation that changes the fundamental attributes of Parent Capital Stock or
adversely affects the holders of the Company Common Stock or Canadian Co.
Exchangeable Shares who will receive such Parent Capital Stock upon consummation
of the Merger in a manner different from the other holders of such Parent
Capital Stock, (ii) make any material changes to the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of Sub, (iii) make, declare or pay any dividend (other than quarterly
dividends on Parent Common Stock not in excess of $0.03 per share with record
and payment dates consistent with past practice), (iv) permit or cause any
Parent Subsidiaries to do any of the foregoing or agree or commit to any of the
foregoing, (v) take any action that would intentionally or knowingly result in
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 becoming false or
inaccurate in any material respect or (vi) agree in writing or otherwise to take
any of the foregoing actions.

                  SECTION 4.2. No Solicitation by the Company. (a) The Company
shall not, nor shall it permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize
or permit any officer, director or employee of or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage the submission of any Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below),
(ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or
(iii) provide any non-public information regarding the Company to any third
party or engage in any negotiations or discussions in connection with any
Company Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may furnish information to, and engage
in discussions or negotiations with, any party who delivers a written proposal
for a Company Takeover Proposal which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly
facilitated or encouraged after the date of this Agreement in violation of this
Agreement if and so long as the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith by resolution duly adopted that such a proposal (including any
conditions to such proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines are reasonably likely to be satisfied) is, after consulting with the
Company's independent financial advisors, more favorable to the Company
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed
by Parent in response to such Company Takeover Proposal) and is reasonably
capable of being consummated (a "Superior Proposal"); provided, further, that
prior to furnishing information to, or engaging in discussions with, any party
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have received an executed
agreement from such party having terms which are at least as favorable to the
Company as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any officer, director or employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any investment banker, attorney, accountant
or other advisor or representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
4.2(a) by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover
Proposal" means any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of any
class of voting securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including
any proposal or offer relating to the acquisition by the Company in any manner,
directly or indirectly, of any securities or assets of another person in
consideration for the issuance of more than 20% of any class of voting
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or assets representing a
substantial portion of the assets

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any officer, director or employee of or investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing.

                  (b) In the event that prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company receives a Company Takeover
Proposal that is a Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly facilitated or encouraged after the date of this Agreement in
violation of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject
to this and the following sentences) withdraw, modify or change, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company
that the stockholders of the Company vote to give the Company Stockholder
Approval, provided that it gives Parent five business days' prior written notice
of its intention to do so (provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit or
otherwise affect Parent's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(e) at such time as the requirements of such subsection have been met). Any
such withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation by the Board of
Directors of the Company that the stockholders of the Company vote to give the
Company Stockholder Approval shall not change the approval of the Board of
Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, or change the obligation of the Company to present the
Merger for approval at a duly called Company's Stockholders' Meeting on the
earliest practicable date determined in consultation with Parent. From and after
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but in any event
within one calendar day) advise Parent in writing of the receipt, directly or
indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or proposals relating
to a Company Takeover Proposal (including the specific terms thereof and the
identity of the other party or parties involved) and promptly furnish to Parent
a copy of any such written proposal in addition to any information provided to
or by any third party relating thereto. In addition, the Company shall promptly
(but in any event within one calendar day) advise Parent, in writing, if the
Board of Directors of the Company shall make any determination as to any Company
Takeover Proposal as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 4.2(a). Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall be deemed to limit the ability
of the Company to comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, although compliance by the Company with
such obligations shall not relieve the Company of any of its obligations under
Section 4.2 including compliance with the notice requirements set forth herein.

                  (c) In the event that, prior to the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company receives a Company Takeover
Proposal that is a Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly facilitated or encouraged after the date of this Agreement in
violation of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject
to this and the following sentences) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) and enter into a definitive acquisition agreement with respect to
such Company Takeover Proposal, provided that, prior to any such termination,
(i) the Company has provided Parent written notice that it intends to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), identifying the Company Takeover
Proposal then determined to be more favorable and the parties thereto and all of
the material terms thereof, (ii) the Company has delivered a copy of the
definitive acquisition agreement for

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

such Company Takeover Proposal in the form to be entered into, and (iii) at
least five days after the Company has provided the notice referred to in clause
(i) above and at least 48 hours after the Company has made the delivery required
in clause (ii) above (provided that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to
be a Superior Proposal), the Company delivers to Parent (A) a written notice of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(d) and (B) the amount of
the termination fee as provided in Section 7.2(a).

                                   ARTICLE V

the Company and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after

take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock
and rights to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Employee
Stock Plans as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

                  (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock, Special Voting Stock and Company
Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Company's Stockholders' Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the Preferred
Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 4.2, the Company shall, through its
Board of Directors, recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they give
the Company Stockholder Approval and the Preferred Stockholder Approval. Parent
shall vote or cause to be voted all the shares of Company Capital Stock owned of
record by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in favor of the Company Stockholder
Approval and the Preferred Stockholder Approval.

                  (c) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall cause Canadian Co. to prepare the Canadian Proxy

cause the Canadian Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of Canadian
Co. as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 referred to in Section 5.1(a)
above is declared effective under the Securities Act, and to file the Canadian
Proxy Statement with the relevant Canadian provincial regulatory authorities
contemporaneously with such mailing.

practicable following the date of this Agreement, to duly call, give notice of,

Canadian Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 4.2, the Company shall cause
Canadian Co., through the Board of Directors of Canadian Co., to recommend to
the holders of Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares that they give the Canadian
Shareholder Approval. Parent shall vote or cause to be voted all the shares of
Canadian Capital Stock owned of record by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in
favor of the Canadian Shareholder Approval.

                  SECTION 5.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of
such other party, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time of the Merger to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
respective subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities
laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as such other party may reasonably request, including any information
requested with respect to stockholder approval at the Company Stockholders'
Meeting and the status of the efforts to obtain such approval. Such information
shall be held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with,
the provisions of the letter, dated September 1, 1999, between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

                  SECTION 5.3. Reasonable Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, the
Canadian Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or
other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement;
provided, however, that a party shall not be obligated to take any action
pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or the obtaining of any
waiver, consent, approval or exemption is reasonably likely to result in the
imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to in clause (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 6.1(g) unless and to the extent such imposition is
primarily attributable to an acquisition by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
announced or disclosed after the date of this Agreement. In connection with and

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and their respective Boards
of Directors shall (i) take all action necessary so that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, the Canadian Arrangement, this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all commercially reasonable
action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

                  (b) The Company and Parent shall keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the
requisite approvals and consents or governmental orders, including, without
limitation: (i) promptly notifying the other of, and if in writing furnishing
the other with copies of, any communications from or with any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger, the Canadian Arrangement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) permitting the other party to
review in advance, and considering in good faith the view of one another in
connection with, any proposed communication with any Governmental Entity in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any antitrust law; and (iii)
not agreeing to participate in any meeting or discussion with any governmental
authority in connection with proceedings under or relating to any antitrust law
unless it consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted
by such governmental authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or
Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or
warranty made by it or contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such
representation or warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 5.4. Benefit Plans. (a) Effective as of the Effective
Time of the Merger and for a one-year period following the Effective Time of the
Merger, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries and successors to provide, those persons who, at the Effective Time
of the Merger, were employees of the Company and its subsidiaries not
represented by any certified or recognized labor organization ("Covered
Employees"), with benefits and compensation during their continuing employment
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefits provided to such employees as of the date of this Agreement; provided
that nothing herein shall restrict Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
terminating the employment of any such employees in accordance with applicable
laws and contractual rights, if any, of such employees.

                  (b) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to:
(i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Covered Employees under any welfare plan that

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time of the
Merger; (ii) provide each such Covered Employee with credit for any co-payment
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time of the Merger in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans that
such employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time of the
Merger; and (iii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for purposes of
vesting and eligibility for all service with the Company and its affiliates
under each employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of the Parent or its
affiliates in which such employees are eligible to participate to the extent
such service was credited for similar purposes under similar plans of the
Company or its subsidiaries; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Covered Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

                  (c) Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation after the
consummation of the Merger to pay all amounts provided under all of the Employee
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms, and (ii) honor and cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all rights, privileges and modifications to or
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plans that become effective as a result of
such change in control in accordance with their terms, subject in each case to
all rights to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with
its terms.

                  (d) In the event the Effective Time of the Merger occurs prior
to December 31, 2000, then at the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall pay
or cause to be paid to each Covered Employee, in respect of such person's annual
bonus for calendar year 2000 under the 1997 Incentive Plan, an amount equal to
the product of (i) such employee's bonus for calendar year 2000, computed based
solely upon performance through the Effective Time of the Merger, as reasonably
determined by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in
calendar year 2000 as of the Effective Time of the Merger and the denominator of
which is 365.

                  SECTION 5.5. Indemnification. (a) Parent shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' obligations to indemnify (including any
obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or former directors or
officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for acts or omissions by such
directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time of the Merger to
the extent that such obligations of the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiaries exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the
Restated Articles of Incorporation, By-laws of the Company, the organizational
documents of the Company Subsidiaries, individual indemnity agreements or
otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such Restated Articles of
Incorporation, By-laws, the organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries
and individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time of the Merger until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions.
Parent shall cause (including providing the necessary funding) the payment of
all indemnification obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.5(a).

                  (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time of the
Merger, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided
that Parent may substitute therefor policies with

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous) with
respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or
before the Effective Time of the Merger; provided, however, that Parent shall
not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the
extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum
Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be
obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. The Company
represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is $376,000.

                  SECTION 5.6. Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section

banker or financial advisor, incurred in connection with the Merger, the
Canadian Arrangement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Canadian Arrangement Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that expenses
incurred in connection with printing and mailing the Proxy Statement, the
Canadian Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company.

                  SECTION 5.7. Public Announcements. Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company and Canadian Co., on the other hand, shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the
Canadian Arrangement, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any securities exchange.

                  SECTION 5.8. Accounting Treatment. Each of Parent and the
Company shall not take any action and shall not fail to take any action which
action or failure to act would prevent, or would be likely to prevent, the
Merger from qualifying for pooling of interests accounting treatment and shall
use reasonable efforts to obtain the letters of accountants referred to in
Section 6.1(f).

                  SECTION 5.9. Affiliates. Prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons
who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted for approval to the
stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company (including all
directors of the Company) for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The
Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent at least 30 days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B to this Agreement.

thereof) applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, shall have been
terminated or shall have expired. Any consents, approvals and filings under any
foreign antitrust law shall have been obtained or made without (i) the
imposition of conditions or (ii) the requirement of divestiture, except for such
consents, approvals and authorizations the failure of which to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect after the Effective Time of the Merger, and except for
conditions imposed or divestitures required that are primarily attributable to
the announcement or disclosure after the date of this Agreement of an
acquisition by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

                  (d) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining
order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the
consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; provided, however, that subject
to the proviso in Section 5.3(a) each of the parties shall have used reasonable
efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or other order and to appeal
as promptly as possible any such injunction or other order that may be entered.

                  (e) Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective under
the Securities Act and shall not be the subject of any stop order or proceedings
seeking a stop order, and Parent shall have received all state securities or
"blue sky" authorizations necessary to issue the Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  (f) Pooling Letters. Parent shall have received a letter from
Arthur Andersen LLP, dated as of the Closing Date, stating that the Merger will
be treated as a pooling of interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 16 and the Company shall have received a letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers
LLP ("PwC"), dated as of the Closing Date, that based upon the information set
forth in a representation letter furnished to PwC by the Company, PwC concurs
with the conclusions of the Company's management that, as of the Closing Date,
no conditions

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

exist that would preclude the Company from being a party to a business
combination for which the pooling of interests method of accounting would be
available.

                  (g) No Governmental Entity Litigation. There shall not be
pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (i)
challenging the acquisition by Parent or Sub of any shares of Company Common

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seeking to obtain from
the Company, Parent or Sub any damages that are material in relation to the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit
the ownership or operation by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary of any material portion of the business or assets of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or to compel
the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to dispose
of or hold separate any material portion of the business or assets of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as a result of
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of Parent, Sub or Canadian
Sub to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and Canadian Co., including the right
to vote such capital stock on all matters properly presented to the stockholders
of the Surviving Corporation or Canadian Co., (iv) seeking to prohibit Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary from effectively controlling in any material respect the
business or operations of the Company or the Company Significant Subsidiaries or
(v) which otherwise is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, except to the extent such suit,
action or proceeding is primarily attributable to the announcement or disclosure
after the date of this Agreement of an acquisition by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary.

                  (h) Canadian Arrangement. Canadian Co. shall have obtained the
Canadian Shareholder Approval, and each of the conditions to consummation of the
Canadian Arrangement capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing shall have
been satisfied.

representation or warranty) on the date of this Agreement and on and as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of

failures of representations and warranties to be true and correct in all
respects, individually and taken together with all other such failures, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.1(c)(i) of

Investment in U.S. Real Property Tax Act of 1980 certification ("FIRPTA

a specified date, the accuracy of which will be determined as of the specified
date), unless the failure or failures of representations and warranties to be
true and correct in all respects, individually and taken together with all other
such failures, would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. The representations and warranties of Parent set forth in the
last sentence of Section 3.2(e) of this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all respects on the date of this Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date. The Company shall have received a

                        Termination, Amendment and Waiver

                  SECTION 7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, whether before or after the
Company Stockholder Approval:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

                  (b) by either Parent or the Company:

                           (i) if, at a duly held stockholders meeting of the

         Approval is voted upon, the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have
         been obtained or if, at a duly held meeting of the Canadian Co.'s
         shareholders or any adjournment thereof at which the Canadian

         shall not have been obtained;

                           (ii) subject to Section 7.6, if the Merger shall not
         have been consummated on or before December 31, 2000 (the "Outside
         Date"), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result of a
         willful, Material Breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to
         terminate this Agreement;

                           (iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
         Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
         taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
         prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action
         shall have become final and non-appealable; or

                           (iv) in the event of a breach by the other party of
         any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in
         this Agreement which (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition
         set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b), as
         applicable, and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days
         after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such
         breach (provided that the terminating party is not then in breach of
         any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement that would
         give rise to a failure of a condition as described in clause (A)
         above);

<PAGE>

                  (c) by either Parent or the Company in the event that any
condition to the obligation of such party to effect the Merger set forth in
Section 6.1(f) or 6.2 (in the case of Parent) or Section 6.1(f) or 6.3 (in the
case of the Company) is not capable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date

failure of a condition as described in clause (A) of Section 7.1(b)(iv) above);

                  (d) by the Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have approved, and the Company shall concurrently with such termination
enter into, a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal that is a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that (i) such Company Takeover Proposal was not
solicited by the Company and did not otherwise result from a breach of Section
4.2(a), (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have complied with the
requirements of Sections 4.2(b) and 4.2(c) in connection with such Company
Takeover Proposal and (iii) no termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) shall

                  (e) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have (i) failed to recommend to the stockholders of the Company that they give

adverse to Parent its recommendation to the Company's stockholders that they
give the Company Stockholder Approval or (iii) failed to reaffirm its

                  SECTION 7.2. Termination Fee; Effect of Termination. (a) In

7.1(e) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) and

shall pay to Parent a fee of $16,000,000, which amount shall be payable by wire
transfer of same day funds, on the date of termination of this Agreement (in the
event of a payment pursuant to clause (i) or (ii)), or on the date that a
Company Acquisition is consummated (in the event of a payment pursuant to clause
(iii)). The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.2(a) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment need be made by the Company pursuant
to this Section 7.2(a) if Parent shall be in Material Breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement.

                  (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent or

(up to $2,500,000) actually incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer
of same day funds within three business days of written demand, accompanied by a
reasonably detailed statement of such expenses and appropriate supporting
documentation, therefor. Not-

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

withstanding the foregoing, no payment need be made pursuant to this Section
7.2(b) if the terminating party shall be in Material Breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement.

                  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Breach" shall
mean a breach that is material by reference to (i) the breaching party and its

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) the benefits expected to be
received by the non-breaching party and its stockholders as a result of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, ""Company Acquisition" means (i)
consummation of the Company Takeover Proposal giving rise to the termination
described in Section 7.1(d), (ii) a consolidation, exchange of shares or merger
of the Company with any person, other than Parent or one of its subsidiaries, in
which the Company shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, unless
the holders of Company Common Stock and Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares
immediately before such consolidation, share exchange or merger shall after such
transaction represent more than 50% of the voting stock of the surviving
corporation or the surviving corporation's direct or indirect parent outstanding
immediately after such consolidation, merger or share exchange, (iii) a merger
of the Company with a person, other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, in
which the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation but the then
outstanding Company Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or
other securities of the Company or any other person or cash or any other
property or shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued, such that in each
case, the holders of Company Common Stock and Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares
outstanding immediately before such merger shall after such merger represent
less than 50% of the voting stock of the Company or the Company's direct or
indirect parent outstanding immediately after the merger, (iv) the acquisition
of beneficial ownership (as such term is used under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the voting stock of the Company by any person
other than pursuant to a consolidation, share exchange or merger in which the
holders of Company Common Stock and Canadian Co. Exchangeable Shares immediately
before such consolidation, share exchange or merger shall after such transaction
represent more than 50% of the voting stock of the surviving corporation's
direct or indirect parent outstanding immediately after such consolidation,
merger or share exchange, or (v) a sale, lease or other transfer of 50% or more
of the assets of Company to any person, other than Parent or one of its
subsidiaries.

                  (d) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either
the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part
of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of the last sentence of
Section 5.2, Section 5.6, this Section 7.2 and Article VIII and except that
nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 7.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after the Company Stockholder Approval or the
Canadian Shareholder Approval; provided, however, that: (a) after the Company
Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires
further approval by such stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders, (b) after the Preferred Stockholder Approval, there shall be made
no amendment that by law requires further approval by such stockholders without

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

the further approval of such stockholders, and (c) after the Canadian
Shareholder Approval there shall be made no amendment that by law requires
further approval by such shareholders without the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

                  SECTION 7.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, the parties may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject
to the proviso of Section 7.3, waive compliance with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

                  SECTION 7.5. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension
or Waiver. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, an amendment
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 7.4 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Sub
or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, in the case of an extension
or waiver pursuant to Section 7.4, the duly authorized designee of its Board of
Directors.

                  SECTION 7.6. Parent Delaying Transactions.

                  (a) Following the announcement of a Delaying Transaction,
Parent shall no longer have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section
7.1(b)(ii) to the extent the Merger shall not have been consummated primarily as
a result of such Delaying Transaction.

                  (b) Following the announcement of a Delaying Transaction, the
Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon five business days
prior notice to Parent if the Merger is unlikely to be consummated prior to
January 31, 2001 primarily as a result of such Delaying Transaction.

                  (c) For purposes of this Section 7.6(a) the term "Delaying
Transaction" shall mean any business combination, acquisition or intended
acquisition of assets by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries that would require
