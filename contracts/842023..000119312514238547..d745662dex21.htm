RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _Merger_ "). Upon consummation of
the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent; 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders that the parties consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, conditions and
agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereby agree as follows:

corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger will
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

(b) Effective Time. As soon as practicable on the date of the Closing, and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent will cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of

(c) Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to
the Closing contained in _Section 6_, the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as
practicable (but not later than three Business Days) after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions to the Closing contained in _Section 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), unless another date
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; it being understood that the
parties currently intend to close on July 31, 2014, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." All proceedings to be

Surviving Corporation attached to the Certificate of Merger, and, as so
amended and restated, such Company Charter will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein and by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and

Legal Requirements.

(iii) Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time, the
board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist solely of the
members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office until the earlier of his or her

and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance with the Company Charter and
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(iv) Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time, the
officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of the Company

distribution of the Escrow Amount will be distributed among the Company
Securityholders and the manner in which each such distribution will be
calculated; (f) the amount of Company Cash; (g) the amount of Specified
Transaction Expenses (including an itemized list of each such Specified
Transaction Expense indicating the general nature of such expense ( _e.g._ ,
legal, accounting, etc.), and the Person to whom such expense is owed) and the
wire transfer information of each such Person; (h) the Company Debt
Payoff Amount, along with a breakdown by lender, amount of Company Debt and
the wire transfer information of each lender; (i) the aggregate amount of
Company Change in Control Payments, along with a breakdown by Person entitled
to receive such payment; (j) the Aggregate Company Warrant Exercise Price
Amount and the Aggregate Company Warrant Payment Amount as of the Closing; (k)
the Aggregate Company Option Exercise Price Amount and the Aggregate Company
Option Payment Amount as of the Closing; (l) the Escrow Amount; and (m) the
Contingency Amount. In no event will the aggregate amount payable by Parent
(including for Dissenting Shares) exceed the Aggregate Merger Consideration,
as adjusted pursuant to  _Section 1.5_.

(c) Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. The Company will prepare and deliver to
Parent, no less than three Business Days prior to the Closing, an update to
the Consideration Spreadsheet setting forth any changes in amounts due to a
change in the estimated time of the Closing and any Dissenting Shares not
entitled to any of the Closing Merger Consideration (the " _Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet_ ").

(d) Updates to Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. In connection with any
scheduled distribution of the Escrow Amount to the Company Securityholders,
the Securityholders Representative may deliver to Parent (and to the Paying
Agent and Escrow Agent, as appropriate) an updated Consideration Spreadsheet
that reflects such contemplated distributions of the Escrow Amount to Company
Securityholders.

(e) Accuracy of Consideration Spreadsheets. The Consideration Spreadsheet,
the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, and any other updates to the
Consideration Spreadsheet are the sole responsibility of the Company
Securityholders, and the Company Securityholders hereby agree that neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of Parents Affiliates, will have any
responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions or inaccuracies therein.
Parent, its Affiliates and Paying Agent will be entitled to rely on the
accuracy of the Consideration Spreadsheet, the Closing Consideration
Spreadsheet, and any other updates to the Consideration Spreadsheet in all
respects, and Parents obligation to make any payments pursuant to this
_Section 1_ will be deemed fulfilled to the extent that Parent makes such
payments in accordance with the foregoing.

 



6 (f) Escrow Account. $25,000,000 of the Closing Merger Consideration (the "
_Escrow Amount_ ") will be withheld and deposited by Parent in a separate
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "). The Escrow Amount will be held and distributed as provided in the
Escrow Agreement and as described herein. The Escrow Amount will be held
solely for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the
Company Securityholders set forth in this Agreement and making any payments
owed to Parent or the other Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Agreement.
Subject to a reserve for pending claims, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agreement will provide for the
release of amounts remaining in the Escrow Account on the 15-month
anniversary of the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amounts subject
to unresolved claims will be released until such claims are resolved. Any
release and payment of amounts remaining in the Escrow Account to Company
Securityholders will be made in accordance with the Consideration Spreadsheet,
as updated in accordance with this Agreement. All fees, costs and expenses of
the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Account, and of the Paying Agent
with respect to the Exchange Fund, will be paid by Parent. The Escrow Amount
will be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the
terms thereof. The Escrow Amount will be held as a trust fund and will not be
subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial
process of any creditor of any party, and will be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger by the Company Securityholders will constitute approval of the Escrow
Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the
placement of the Escrow Amount in escrow.

 

(g) Contingency Amount. $500,000 of the Closing Merger Consideration (the "
_Contingency Amount_ ") will be deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent.
The Contingency Amount will be used, in the sole and absolute discretion of
the Securityholders Representative, to pay (i) the costs and expenses, if
any, incurred by the Securityholders Representative in accordance with or
otherwise related to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Securityholders
Representative Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
(ii) any amounts payable under _Section 1.5(d)_ by the Securityholders
Representative, and (iii) any other costs or expenses incurred by the
Securityholders Representative in the performance of its obligations as the
Securityholders Representative. The Escrow Agreement will provide that, upon
the request of the Securityholders Representative, any remaining Contingency
Amount will be released and paid to the Company Securityholders (in accordance
with each Company Securityholders Pro Rata Portion). All fees, costs and
expenses of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Contingency Amount will be
paid by the Securityholders Representative for and on behalf of the Company
Securityholders (in accordance with each Company Securityholders Pro
Rata Portion).

1.5 Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment.

 

(a) The Company will deliver to Parent the Companys good-faith estimate of
(i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net
Working_

 



7   __ _Capital_ "), (ii) the Company Cash (the " _Estimated Company Cash_ "),
and (iii) the corresponding Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Closing
Date Statement_ "), no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. Such estimates will be based on the Companys books and records, the
best estimate of the management of the Company and other information then
available. Parent will have the right to review the Estimated Closing Date
Statement and such supporting documentation or data of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request. If Parent does not
agree with the Estimated Closing Date Statement, the Company and Parent will
negotiate in good faith to mutually agree on an acceptable Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital and Estimated Company Cash, and the Company will
consider in good faith any proposed comments or changes that Parent may
reasonably suggest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to include in
the Estimated Closing Date Statement any changes proposed by Parent, or the
acceptance by Parent of the Estimated Closing Date Statement, or
the consummation of the Closing, will not limit or otherwise affect Parents
remedies under this Agreement, including Parents right to include such
changes or other changes in the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, or
constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of the accuracy of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure of
Parent and the Securityholders Representative to reach such mutual agreement
will not give any party the right to terminate this Agreement or otherwise
fail to close the transactions contemplated hereunder, and the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital (i) delivered by the Company or (ii) as
agreed to by the Company and Parent will be the figure used for purposes of
determining the Estimated Adjustment Amount.

(b) The Adjustment Amount used for the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ") will
be based on the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, and the Estimated
Company Cash will be the amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Date
Statement. Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the exact
Adjustment Amount and the exact amount of Company Cash will not be known as of
the Closing Date and that the Adjustment Amount and amount of Company Cash
determined on the Closing Date may need to be adjusted subsequent to the
Closing Date on the basis set forth herein. Accordingly, no later than sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to
the Securityholders Representative (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the
Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") prepared
in accordance with GAAP and the Companys past practices (as adjusted by the
terms of this Agreement), (ii) a determination of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, (iii) a statement setting forth the determination of the resulting
Adjustment Amount, and (iv) its calculation of the actual Company Cash (the "
_Closing Date Statement_ ").

(c) The Securityholders Representative and Parent will have the right to
review all records, work papers and calculations that are reasonably
necessary for the purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Date Statement,
the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement. The
Securityholders Representative will have 30 days after delivery of the
Closing Date Statement in which to notify Parent in writing (such notice, a "
_Closing Date Dispute Notice_ ") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement with,
the items reflected on the Closing Date Statement (and specifying the amount
in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
discrepancy or disagreement), and upon agreement by Parent regarding the
adjustment requested by the Securityholders Representative, an appropriate
adjustment will be made thereto. If the Securityholders Representative does
not deliver a Closing Date Dispute

 



8  Notice to Parent during such 30 day period, the Closing Date Statement will
be deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the Securityholders
Representative. If the Securityholders Representative timely delivers a
Closing Date Dispute Notice and Parent and the Securityholders Representative
do not agree, within 15 days after timely delivery of the Closing Date Dispute
Notice, to resolve any discrepancy or disagreement therein, the discrepancy
or disagreement will be submitted for review and final determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The review by the Independent Accounting Firm
will be limited to the discrepancies and disagreements set forth in the
Closing Date Dispute Notice, and the resolution of such discrepancies and
disagreements and the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
and Company Cash and the resulting Adjustment Amount by the Independent
Accounting Firm must be (i) in writing, (ii) made in accordance with GAAP (as
adjusted by the terms of this Agreement) in accordance with the Companys past
practices, (iii) with respect to any specific discrepancy or disagreement, no
greater than the higher amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholders
Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount
calculated by Parent or the Securityholders Representative as the case
may be, (iv) made as promptly as practical after the submission of such
discrepancies and disagreements to the Independent Accounting Firm (but in no
event later than 30 days after the date of submission), and (v) final and
binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns for all purposes hereof, and not subject to collateral
attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud. The fees, costs and
expenses of retaining the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated by
the Independent Accounting Firm between the Company Securityholders and Parent
in accordance with the Independent Accounting Firms judgment as to the
relative merits of the respective positions of the parties regarding the
manner in which any item or items are treated on the Closing Date Statement
with respect to which they were unable to agree as reflected in their
respective reports to the Independent Accounting Firm. Following the
resolution of all objections of the Securityholders Representative regarding
the manner in which any item or items are treated on the Closing Date
Statement, by mutual agreement or the Independent Accounting Firm, Parent will
prepare the final Closing Date Statement reflecting such resolution and will
deliver copies thereof to the Securityholders Representative and such final
Closing Date Statement will be the " _Final Closing Date Statement_ ," and,
for the avoidance of doubt, the final Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Final Closing Date Statement will be the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ " and the
Company Cash set forth in the Final Closing Date Statement will be the "
_Final Company Cash_." 

(d) If the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount
used for the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration on the Closing
Date, then the Closing Merger Consideration will be increased on a dollar-for-
dollar basis by an amount equal to the entire amount of such difference. If
the Estimated Adjustment Amount used for the calculation of the Closing
Merger Consideration on the Closing Date exceeds the Final Adjustment Amount,
then the Closing Merger Consideration will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by an amount equal to the entire amount of such difference.

 

(e) If the Final Company Cash exceeds the Estimated Company Cash, then the
Closing Merger Consideration will be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by an amount equal to the entire amount of such difference. If the Estimated
Company Cash exceeds the Final Company Cash, then the Closing Merger
Consideration will be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by an amount
equal to the entire amount of such difference.

 



9 (f) Without duplication, all amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 1.5(d)_
and  _1.5(e)_ will be aggregated in determining whether there is reduction or
an increase to the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
1.5_. In the event of an increase to the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant
to this  _Section 1.5_, within five Business Days of the final determination
of the Final Adjustment Amount and Final Company Cash, Parent will deposit (i)
with the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders and
Company Warrantholders and (ii) with the Surviving Corporation for further
distribution to the Company Optionholders through the Surviving Corporations
payroll system, _less_ any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes,
the entire amount of such increase by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. In the event
of a reduction to the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
1.5_, within five Business Days of the final determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount, the Company Securityholders shall pay or direct the
Securityholders Representative to pay to Parent the entire amount of such
reduction.

 

1.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, recording and other similar
fees payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby
will be the responsibility of, and will be paid by, the Company
Securityholders.

 

1.7 Treatment of Company Securities.

 

(a) Conversion. At and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any Company Securityholder, each Company Share outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, if any) will be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive from Parent, promptly following the
surrender of the certificate representing such Company Share (each, a "
_Company Stock Certificate_ ") and a properly completed letter of transmittal,
the consideration set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated
in accordance with this _Section 1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no
consideration will be paid with respect to any Company Share held in treasury
of the Company and each Company Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) each Dissenting
Share will be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving
Corporation with respect thereto in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law. For purposes of calculating the amount of the Closing Merger
Consideration payable to each Company Securityholder pursuant to this _Section
1_, all amounts payable in cash to such Company Securityholder will be
aggregated and rounded up to the nearest whole cent (with $0.005 being rounded
upward) and computed after aggregating the amounts payable for all shares of
each class and series of Company Shares held by such Company Securityholder.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares, Company
Options and Company Warrants will cease to have any rights with respect to the
Company Shares, Company Options and Company Warrants represented thereby,
other than the right to receive the amounts provided in this _Section 1_ or,
with respect to the holders of Company Shares who properly demand appraisal in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, the right to exercise
their rights in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

 



10 (b) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and, as of the
Effective Time, all such shares will constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares will remain
outstanding and evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.8 Surrender of Company Stock Certificates.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates representing
the Company Shares and Company Warrants that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights as stockholders or
warrantholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company
will be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such
Company Shares will be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate will be canceled and will be exchanged as provided in this
_Section 1.8_.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to each Major Stockholder a
copy of this Agreement together with a letter of transmittal in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ").
Following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will deliver to each other
holder of Company Shares and each holder of Company Warrants a Letter of
Transmittal, in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement. Following the
Effective Time and surrender to the Paying Agent of a Company Stock
Certificate or Company Warrant (or an affidavit of loss and a bond in lieu
thereof), together with a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment of an amount equal to
the applicable amount set forth on the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, and
the Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant so surrendered will be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.8_, each
Company Stock Certificate and Company Warrant will be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
an amount equal to the applicable amount set forth on the Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet. If any Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant
is lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant may provide (in lieu of such
Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant) an appropriate affidavit as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate or Company Warrant;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the owner of any such certificate or Company
Warrant will also be required to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent or the
Paying Agent in its discretion may require.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders Representative, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent will be
liable to any Company Securityholder for any portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration delivered to a public

 



11  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement. Any Aggregate Merger Consideration remaining undistributed
to Company Securityholders immediately prior to such time as such Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this
_Section 1_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

1.9 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective Time, are
held by a Company Stockholder exercising such Company Stockholders right of
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into or represent the
right to receive payment in accordance with _Sections 1.7_ and _1.8_ , and
such Company Stockholders will be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such Company Stockholders in Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Company Stockholders
right of appraisal is not perfected, or if such Company Stockholders demand
for payment is withdrawn pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the withdrawal of such demand, such shares
will automatically be converted into and will represent only the right
to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares) payment in accordance with _Sections 1.7_ and _1.8_.

 

(b) The Company will (i) give Parent prompt notice of any written demand
received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to
purchase Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Delaware
General Corporation Law, and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand. The Company will not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the
Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent has consented in
writing to such payment or settlement offer.

1.10 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company Securityholder such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Company Securityholder. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
to determine, and use commercially reasonable efforts authorized by applicable
Legal Requirements to minimize, any withholding Taxes.

 



12 1.11 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Securities six months
following later of (a) the final release from the Escrow Account or (b) the
day that is 15 months from the Closing Date will, upon demand by Parent, be
delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Securities who has not
previously complied with the provisions of this _Section 1_ will be entitled,
after complying with the provisions of this _Section 1_, and subject to any
escheat or similar laws, to receive from Parent payment of the applicable
portion of such undistributed amount with respect to such Company Securities.

1.12 Treatment of Company Options. Company Options will not be continued,
assumed or substituted by the Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the
Merger. Prior to the Closing, the Companys board of directors will adopt
appropriate resolutions and will take all other actions necessary and
appropriate to cause each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, to become fully vested and
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Option Termination Agreements) a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the Company Option Payment Amount set
forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this
_Section 1_, less any applicable withholding Taxes. As of the Effective Time,
all Company Options will automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a
Company Option will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Company Option Payment Amount set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this _Section 1_, if
any, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Option Termination Agreement. In accordance with this Agreement and the
Option Termination Agreements, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the date that any portion of the Company Option Payment Amount set forth on
the Consideration Spreadsheet is due (and, with respect to payments made as
of the Closing, if any, no later than the first regular payroll date occurring
at least three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, will pay to
each former holder of Company Options such Company Option Payment Amounts as
such holder will be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section 1.12_ and
the holders Option Termination Agreement, reduced by applicable withholding
Taxes; _provided_ , that, consistent with _Section 5.4(f)(iii)_, if and to
the extent that any Contingency Amount is released to former holders of
Company Options, it shall not be subject to withholding or processed through
payroll.

1.13 Treatment of Company Warrants.

 

(a) Company Warrants will not be continued, assumed or substituted for by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the Merger. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Companys board of directors will adopt
appropriate resolutions and will have taken all other actions necessary and
appropriate to cause each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be cancelled and converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal
to the amount set forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in
accordance with this _Section 1_, less any applicable withholding Taxes. As
of the Effective Time, all Company Warrants will automatically cease to exist,
and each holder of a Company Warrant will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the amount set forth in the
Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this _Section 1_,
less any applicable withholding Taxes.

 



13 1.14 Securityholders Representative.

 

(a) Each Company Securityholder hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
Fortis Advisors LLC as his, her or its sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent
and attorney-in-fact (the " _Securityholders  Representative_"), with full
power of substitution to act in such Company Securityholders name, place and
stead with respect to all transactions contemplated by and all terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and to act on such
Company Securityholders behalf in any dispute, litigation or arbitration
involving this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and to do or refrain from
doing all such further acts and things, and execute all such documents, on
such Company Securityholders behalf, as the Securityholders Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including the power: (i) to execute and deliver this Agreement and any and all
amendments, waivers or modifications hereof; (ii) to waive any condition to
the obligations of such Company Securityholder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) to execute and deliver all ancillary
agreements, certificates and documents, and to make representations and
warranties therein, on behalf of such Company Securityholder that the
Securityholders Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement; and (iv) to do or refrain from doing any further act or
deed on behalf of such Company Securityholder as is assigned, delegated or
charged to the Securityholders Representative or that the Securityholders
Representative otherwise deems necessary or appropriate in its sole
discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, as fully and
completely as such Company Securityholder could do if personally present.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Representative shall have
no obligation to act on behalf of the Company Securityholders, except as
expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Paying Agent
Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Securityholders Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit
or the Company Disclosure Schedule. All such actions set forth or described in
this _Section 1.14(a)_ will be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside this
Agreement and will be binding on the Company Securityholders.

(b) The appointment of the Securityholders Representative and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholders
Representative and the Advisory Group (as defined below) hereunder are: (i)
deemed coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable, and survive the
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Company
Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall
survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company Securityholder of the
whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Amount.
Parent, its Affiliates and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely
rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Securityholders Representative
on behalf of the Company Securityholders in all matters referred to herein.
All notices delivered by Parent or the Company (following the Closing) to the
Securityholders Representative (whether pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the
benefit of the Company Securityholders will constitute notice to the
Company Securityholders. The Securityholders Representative will act for the
Company Securityholders on all of the matters

 



14  set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Securityholders
Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Securityholders as a whole and consistent with its obligations under this
Agreement, but the Securityholders Representative will not be responsible to
the Company Securityholders for any loss or damages it or they may suffer by
reason of the performance by the Securityholders Representative of its
duties under this Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from fraud by
the Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative shall
be entitled to: (i) rely upon the Consideration Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon
any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Securityholder or other party.

 

(c) If the Securityholders Representative resigns or is otherwise similarly
unable to carry out its duties hereunder, then the representatives of the
Advisory Group (as defined below) will, within five Business Days, appoint a
new Securityholders Representative. The representatives of the Advisory Group
may at any time, for any reason or no reason, remove the Securityholders
Representative. If at any time there is not a Securityholders Representative
and the Company Securityholders fail to designate in writing a successor
Securityholders Representative within five Business Days after receipt of a
written request delivered by Parent to the representatives of the Advisory
Group requesting that a successor Securityholders Representative be
designated in writing, then Parent may petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a new Securityholders Representative hereunder.

(d) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholders
Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the
Securityholders Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.14_ will be
conclusive and binding upon each Company Securityholder and such Company
Securityholders successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by such Company Securityholder, and no Company Securityholder will have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Each
Company Stockholder and each Company Warrantholder, by the execution and
delivery of any Letter of Transmittal, each Company Optionholder, by the
execution and delivery of any Option Termination Agreement, will be deemed to
have approved, confirmed and ratified any action taken by the
Securityholders Representative in the exercise of the power-of-attorney
granted to the Securityholders Representative pursuant to this _Section
1.14_, which power-of-attorney, being coupled with an interest, is
irrevocable and will survive the death, incapacity or incompetence of each
such Company Securityholder.

(e) Certain Company Securityholders have entered into a letter agreement with
the Securityholders Representative (the " _Securityholders Representative
Agreement_ ") to provide direction to the Securityholders Representative in
connection with the performance of its services under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (such Company Securityholders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "
_Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Securityholders Representative (together
with its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and
employees) nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "
_Securityholders  Representative Group_") will be liable to the Company
Securityholders for any act done or omitted hereunder in its capacity as the
Securityholders Representative unless caused by fraud by the Securityholders
Representative. The Securityholders Representative will not have any
fiduciary, agency or other duties to the

 



15  Company Securityholders and its only obligations will be as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. The Securityholders Representative is serving in
that capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not
personally liable for any of the obligations of the Company Securityholders
hereunder, and Parent and the Company agree that they will not look to the
underlying assets of the Securityholders Representative for the satisfaction
of any obligations of the Company Securityholders (or any of them). The
Company Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders Representative
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or administration of its duties. The Company
Securityholders will severally and not jointly, in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Portions (and not jointly), indemnify and defend
the Securityholders Representative Group and hold the Securityholders
Representative Group on demand harmless against any damages, losses, claims,
liabilities, fees, costs, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, or
expenses incurred by the Securityholders Representative Group and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Securityholders Representative Groups duties hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel,
accountants, auditors and other advisors or skilled professionals retained by
the Securityholders Representative or in connection with seeking recovery
from insurers, which rights will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Representative. Such Securityholders Representative expenses
may be recovered first, from the Contingency Amount, second, from any
distribution of the Escrow Amount otherwise distributable to the Company
Securityholders at the time of distribution, and third, directly from the
Company Securityholders based on their respective Pro Rata Portion (severally
and not jointly). The Securityholders Representative will be entitled to
retain its own counsel and other professional advisers in connection with the
acceptance, performance or administration of the
Securityholders Representatives duties hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement or the exercise of any of the Securityholders Representatives
rights hereunder, and will further be entitled to withdraw from the
Contingency Amount the amount of any fees and expenses of such counsel and
professionals. In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty hereunder, the
Securityholders Representative may, in its sole and reasonable discretion,
refrain from taking any action, unless the Securityholders Representative
receives written instructions, signed by the representatives of the Advisory
Group, that eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty. The immunities and rights
to indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders Representative or any member of the representatives of the
Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

 

(f) If (i) the Securityholders Representative elects (1) to assume and
control the defense and/or management of any Third Party Claim at the expense
of Company Securityholders in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_ hereof or (2)
to take any other action under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement that may
require the payment of amounts out of the Contingency Amount, including for
any attorneys, accountants, auditors or other advisors, and (ii) the
Securityholders Representatives good faith estimate of the reasonable
expenses to be incurred by of the Securityholders Representative in
connection with any such action exceeds the balance of the Contingency Amount,
the Securityholders Representative may refrain from taking any such action
until such time as the Securityholders Representative, upon seven days
notice to the Company Securityholders, receives written commitments signed by
the representatives of the Advisory Group for payment of such expenses, in
which case all Company

 



16  Securityholders will pay their Pro Rata Portion of such estimated expenses.
Any such initial notice by the Securityholders Representative to the Company
Securityholders will include a statement of the balance of the Contingency
Amount, the good faith estimate of the reasonable expenses to be incurred by
the Securityholders Representative, the amount by which the estimated
expenses to be incurred exceed the balance of the Contingency Amount, and
each Company Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of such excess expense amount.
Each Company Securityholder will deliver its Pro Rata Portion of any excess
expense amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds, using the
wire instructions identified in any such initial notice, no later than ten
days following the date on which the Securityholders Representative gives
such Company Securityholder notice of the receipt of commitments signed by
the representatives of the Advisory Group for payment of such excess
expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Securityholder will be
required to make any payments, individually or in the aggregate, pursuant to
this  _Section 1.14(f)_ in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
previously received by such Company Securityholder. Any amounts thus paid will
increase the balance of the Contingency Amount.

such disclosure would, in the sole and reasonable judgment of the
Company: (i) jeopardize any attorney-client, work product doctrine or other
privilege, or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirements, fiduciary
duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, in
each case so long as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have reasonably
cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of, or to disclose such,
information on a basis that does not jeopardize such privilege or contravene
any such Legal Requirement. No information received pursuant to an
investigation made under this _Section 5.1_ will be deemed to (i) qualify,
modify, waive, amend or otherwise affect any representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
any certificate or other instrument delivered to Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) amend or otherwise supplement the
information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii) limit or
restrict the remedies available to the parties under applicable Legal
Requirements arising out of a breach of this Agreement, or (iv) limit or
restrict the ability of either party to invoke or rely on the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement set forth in _Section 6_ hereof.

 



45 5.2 Public Disclosure; Confidentiality.

 

(a) Except as may be required by Legal Requirements or stock exchange
requirements, during the Pre-Closing Period, the parties will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement or making any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether
or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
Company may make such disclosure to the Company Securityholders as it deems
necessary or desirable in order to obtain the Required Stockholder Approval
and Option Termination Agreements, so long as such disclosure complies with
applicable Legal Requirements, is consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
and the Company provides Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
provide comments to any such disclosure prior to dissemination to any Company
Securityholders, and (ii) Parent may include disclosures relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein in Parents filings with
the SEC, and otherwise as required by the SEC and Nasdaq, without seeking
approval from, or consulting with, any other parties hereto; _provided_ , that
Parent will make good faith efforts to provide the Company and the
Securityholders Representative with written notice of any such disclosures
made prior to the Closing and to consider in good faith any comments that
either such party has on such filings, except to the extent that any such
disclosures are substantially similar to the information contained in
previous public disclosures made by Parent.

(b) Without limiting the parties obligations under that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 19, 2014, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), none of the parties will issue any such
press release or make any such public statement or disclosure without the
prior approval of Parent and the Company. The terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, are hereby incorporated herein by reference and will continue in
full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will nonetheless continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Securityholders Representative will
not, and, as applicable, will cause its directors, officers, employees,
Representatives and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose,
reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person, or use or otherwise exploit for
their own benefit or for the benefit of anyone, any Confidential
Information (as that term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). The
Securityholders Representative will not have any obligation to keep
confidential (or cause their respective directors, officers, employees,
Representatives and Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential
Information if and to the extent that disclosure thereof is specifically
required by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that disclosure is required by applicable Legal Requirements, the
Securityholders Representative will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, provide Parent and the Company with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to making any disclosure so that the applicable party may
seek an appropriate protective order.

 



46 5.3 Efforts; Government Approvals and Further Assurances.

 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the Closing and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries will execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional actions as any
other party may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm, or evidence
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will: (i) make any filings and give any notices required
to be made or given by such party in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any consent required to be obtained by such party in connection with
this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent, the
Merger Sub and the Company undertakes and agrees to file (or cause their
respective Affiliates to file, as applicable) as soon as practicable, and in
any event prior to ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, a
Notification and Report Form regarding the transactions contemplated hereby as
required by the HSR Act with each of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and to promptly
submit any other filings required to be made under any Antitrust Laws in
foreign jurisdictions. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
promptly deliver to the other a copy of each such filing made (other than
filings made pursuant to the HSR Act), each such notice given and each such
consent obtained during the Pre-Closing Period, it being understood that
delivery of such filings, notices and consents exclusively to the outside
counsel of such other party will be deemed to be in compliance with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(a)_.

 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain the authorizations, consents, orders and approvals
necessary for their execution and delivery of, and the performance of their
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file, as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental
Authority with respect to this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) to submit promptly any
additional information requested by any such Governmental Authority. Each of
Parent and the Company will pay 50% of any filing fee under the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise to the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure
prompt termination of any waiting periods imposed by the HSR Act and other
Antitrust Laws. Each of the Company and Parent will (A) give the other party
prompt notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the consummation of
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (B) keep the
other party informed as to the status of any such legal proceeding. The
Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted by either of them in connection with any legal
proceeding under or relating to national security matters.

 



47 (c) For the purposes of this _Section 5.3_, "commercially
reasonable efforts" of Parent will not require (nor will anything in this
_Section 5.3_ or otherwise in this Agreement require) Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would prohibit or limit in any respect,
or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by Parent, its
Subsidiaries or the Company of any portion of the business or assets of Parent
or the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of Parents Subsidiaries, or
compel Parent or the Company, or any of Parents Subsidiaries, to dispose of,
hold separate or license any portion of the business, assets or Intellectual
Property of Parent or the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of
Parents Subsidiaries, respectively, in each case as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In no event will Parent or the
Company, nor any of Parents Subsidiaries, be obligated to propose or agree to
accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree or hold
separate order, to make any divestiture or to accept any operational
restriction or limitation. With regard to any Governmental Authority, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will, without Parents prior written
consent in Parents sole discretion, discuss with any Governmental Authority
or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss with any Governmental
Authority or commit to alter its business or commercial practices in any way,
or otherwise discuss with any Governmental Authority, take or commit to take
any action that limits Parents freedom of action with respect to, or Parents
ability to retain any of Parents or the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys respective businesses, product lines or assets or
otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the obligations of Parent, its Subsidiaries and
Merger Sub hereunder will not include any requirement to defend any
proceeding challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Closing
beyond the Outside Date.

 

5.4 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the
Securityholders Representative will, and the Surviving Corporation will
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the filing of (i)
any Tax Return or amended Tax Return with respect to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, (ii) audit, or (iii) litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
within such partys possession that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries will (i) retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Parent or the Company, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) give the Securityholders
Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the Securityholders
Representative so requests, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, will allow the

 



48  Securityholders Representative to take possession of such books and
records. Parent and the Securityholders Representative further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries, Parent or the
Company Securityholders that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

(b) Tax Returns.

(i) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Company will prepare and file all Tax Returns
relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that are required to be
filed on or before the Closing Date, which Tax Returns will be prepared in
accordance with past practices and customs. The Company will provide Parent
with copies of such Tax Returns.

 

(ii) Post-Closing Tax Returns. Parent will prepare and file (or cause the
Surviving Corporation to prepare and file) all Tax Returns relating to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date, which Tax Returns to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be prepared in accordance with the Companys past practices and
customs except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement or as set
forth in _Section 6.4(b)(iii)_. In the event that the Taxes reflected on such
Tax Returns could form the basis for a claim of indemnification pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(b)_, Parent will provide the portion of such Tax Returns
relevant to such claim of indemnification to the Securityholders
Representative for review and comment at least 20 days prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Returns, will make reasonable changes consistent with all
applicable Legal Requirements to such Tax Returns as requested by the
Securityholders Representative, and will not file any such Tax Returns
without the consent of the Securityholders Representative, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iii) Guidelines for Income Tax Returns. For purposes of Section 6.4(b)(ii),
(A) all items accruing on the Closing Date shall be allocated to the Companys
taxable period ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not pursuant to the "next
day" rule under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or
pursuant to the ratable allocation method under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)), (B) no election shall be made to
waive any carryback of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the
Code on any Tax Return of the Company filed in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and (C) all Transaction Deductions shall be deducted in Pre-Closing
Tax Periods to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
Parent may, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, prepare the Tax
Returns contemplated in Section 6.3(b)(ii) contrary to the preceding
sentence, provided that Closing Date Net Working Capital and indemnification
with respect to Taxes (including as a result of any breach of a representation
or warranty in  _Section 2.21_) shall each be calculated as if the Tax
Returns had been prepared consistent with such guidelines.

(c) Tax Audits and Contests.

(i) Unless Parent has previously received notice from the Securityholders
Representative of the existence of any Tax Contest (as defined below), Parent

 



49  will, or will cause the Company to, promptly notify the Securityholders
Representative of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events
with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period for which the Company may be liable under this Agreement (such inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no failure to give such notice will relieve the Company
Securityholders of any liability hereunder except to the extent, if any, that
the rights of the Company Securityholders with respect to such claim are
materially prejudiced thereby. Except with respect to income Tax Returns (or
information Tax Returns related to income Taxes) for taxable periods of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date,
Parent will have the authority to represent the interests of the Company
and will have control of the defense, compromise or other resolution of any
Tax Contest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholders Representative
will be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest at the
Company Securityholders expense and Parent will not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that could materially affect
the Tax liability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Securityholders for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or otherwise form the basis
for a claim of indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_) without the
written consent of Securityholders Representative, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Securityholders
Representative will have the authority, at the Company Securityholders
expense, to represent the interests of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and the Company Securityholders and will have control of the defense,
compromise or other resolution of any Tax Contest to the extent that such Tax
Contest involves Tax Returns (or information Tax Returns) related to income
Taxes or Taxes in the nature of Taxes on net income for taxable periods of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent will be entitled to participate in such
Tax Contest at its own expense and the Securityholders Representative will
not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that is
reasonably likely to materially affect the Tax liability of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or Parent for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
occurring after the Closing Date without the written consent of Parent, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(ii) If Parent or the Securityholders Representative elects, by written
notice to the other party, not to control the defense of a Tax Contest that it
has authority to control, the other party may assume control of the defense of
such Tax Contest. In such event, the party electing not to control the
defense of such Tax Contest (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") will be given
the opportunity to participate in, but not direct or conduct, any defense of
such Tax Contest, unless such participation would affect any privilege of the
party controlling the defense of such Tax Contest (the " _Controlling Party_
"). The Non-Controlling Partys participation under such circumstances will be
subject to the Controlling Partys right to control such defense. The
Controlling Party will not settle any such Tax Contest without the consent of
the Non-Controlling Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. The Controlling Party will (i) keep the Non-
Controlling Party advised of the status of such claim and the defense thereof
(including all material developments and events relating thereto) and will
consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with
respect thereto and (ii) make available to the Non-Controlling Party any
documents or materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to
understand the defense of such claim (subject to protection of the attorney-
client privilege). The Non-Controlling Party will furnish the Controlling
Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Tax Contest
(including copies of any

 



50  summons, complaints or other pleadings that may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise reasonably cooperate
with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Tax Contest.

(d) Amended Tax Returns. Except with the prior written consent of the
Securityholders Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
nor any Company Subsidiary shall (i) file or amend, modify or otherwise
change any Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, or (ii) make any Tax election with respect to, or grant an
extension of any applicable statute of limitations for, any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date
after the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated
hereby, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries to carry on its business only in the ordinary course in the same
manner as heretofore conducted. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates shall make an election under Section
338 of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(f) Certain Tax Reporting Matters.

 

(i) _Escrow Account_. All parties hereto agree for all Tax purposes that: (A)
the right of the Company Securityholders (other than in respect Company
Options) to funds in the Escrow Account shall be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment treatment under Section 453
of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local Law,
as appropriate, (B) Parent shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow
Account, and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, if any, or any portion thereof, shall be
allocable to Parent pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, (C) if and to the extent any amount in
the Escrow Account is actually distributed to the Company Securityholders,
interest may be imputed on such amount payable to the Company Securityholders
(other than in respect of Options), as required by Section 483 or 1274 of the
Code, and (D) in no event shall the aggregate payments under the Escrow
Agreement to the Company Securityholders from the Escrow Account exceed
$25,470,000. Clause (D) of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that
the right of the Company Securityholders (other than in respect of Company
Options) to the Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned thereon is
not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. No party hereto shall take any action or filing position
inconsistent with the foregoing, except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(ii) _Contingency Amount_. The Contingency Amount shall be treated as having
been received by the Company Securityholders on the Closing Date for Tax
purposes.

 



51 (iii) _Payments in Respect of Options_. Any payments made in respect of
Company Options pursuant to this Agreement (A) shall be treated as
compensation paid by the Company as and when received by the former holder of
the Company Option to whom such payment is due (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall be the Closing Date with respect to the Contingency Amount, and
when released to the holder of the Option in the case of payments pursuant to
_Section 1.5(f)_, or upon release of funds from the Escrow Account), (B)
shall be net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 1.10, and (C) shall be
made through the Surviving Corporations payroll systems at the time such
payment is made. Any applicable withholding Taxes in respect of the portion of
the Contingency Amount allocable to the former holders of Company Options
will be withheld from the Aggregate Company Option Payment Amount payable at
the Closing when distributed through the Surviving Companys payroll system in
accordance with _Section 1.3(a)(ii)_. 

5.5 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of Company.

 

(a) For a period of six years following the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect in the Surviving Corporations
organizational documents or indemnification agreements the provisions
regarding limitation of liability and indemnification of current or former
directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), and the advancement of expenses
incurred contained in the certificates of incorporation, bylaws, other
organizational documents or indemnification agreements as in effect
immediately prior to the date hereof and shall honor and fulfill to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law such limitation of liability and
indemnification obligations, in each case with respect to matters arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing (including
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Subsequent
to the Closing, Parent also agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties to the same
extent as provided in the preceding sentence.

(b) For a period of six years following the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain (or cause to be maintained), in effect,
either (i) the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company (provided, that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous in any material
respect to the insured parties thereunder) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred at or before the Closing (including
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (ii) a run
off (i.e., "tail") policy or endorsement with respect to the current policy of
directors and officers liability insurance covering claims asserted within
six years after the Closing arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Closing (including consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). Such policies or endorsements shall name as insureds
thereunder all present and former directors and officers of Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, and the Surviving Corporation. To the extent not already
paid at the Closing, the cost of such policies will be treated as a Specified
Transaction Expense of the Company.

(c) For a period of six years following the Closing, if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of the successors or assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation

 



52  (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any other person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (as the case may be) shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.5_. This _Section 5.5_: (A) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time; (B) is intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives during such six year period; (C) shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
during such six year period; and (D) provides rights that are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any Company Indemnified Party, or any heir or representative
of any Company Indemnified Party, may have by contract or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the forgoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be obligated to reimburse, contribute, indemnify or hold
harmless any Company Securityholder pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ for or in
connection with any Damages that such Company Securityholder is obligated to
pay to any Indemnified Person under _Section 8.1(b)_.

5.6 Employees; Benefits.

(a) For a period of 12 months after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
Continuing Employees with (i) annual base salary and base wages, and cash
incentive compensation opportunities and (ii) health and welfare benefits
providing coverage and benefits that are either (A) the same as provided
pursuant to the employee health and welfare benefit plans maintained by
Company as of the date hereof or (B) pursuant to employee health and welfare
benefit plans that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those
provided to employees of Parent or its Affiliates in positions comparable to
positions held by Continuing Employees in the relevant jurisdiction. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability of
Parent or the surviving entity in the Merger to amend or terminate
any Company Employee Plan, or Parent Employee Plan, program, policy, or
arrangement in accordance with their terms and applicable law at any time
after the Effective Time. The provisions contained in this _Section 5.6_ are
included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties hereto and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including, without limitation, any
current or former Company Employee, any participant in any Company Employee
Plan, or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment with
Parent or the surviving entity in the Merger, nor shall they require Parent to
provide, continue, or amend any particular employee benefits after the
consummation of the Merger for any current or former Company Employee.

(b) With respect to any Parent Employee Plans in which Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted under such Parent Employee Plans and applicable Legal Requirements,
each participating Continuing Employees service with the Company (as well as
service with any predecessor employer, solely to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized for purposes of the applicable Company
Employee Plan) or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of its Affiliates for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, and
benefit accruals; _provided, however,_ that, except as expressly provided in
_Section 5.6_, such service need not be recognized to any extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



53 (c) With respect to any Parent Employee Plans providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Employee and in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any such
Parent Employee Plans, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Employee
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

5.7 Parachute Payments. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, but in no event later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company will submit to the stockholders of the Company for
Company Stockholder approval (in compliance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder) for the right of any individual who is
or could reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive payments
and benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code). In addition, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to (a) ensure that the payments and benefits that
would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" be exempt from the
definition of "parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and (b) take all actions necessary to so
exempt any such payments and benefits (including to obtain any necessary
consents from such disqualified individuals).

5.8 Stockholder Action.

 

(a) The Companys board of directors has declared this Agreement, the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, advisable and adopted
a resolution recommending adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the Company
Stockholders (the " _Board Recommendation_ ").

 

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will, in accordance with and pursuant to Section 228 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, use its reasonable best efforts to seek and obtain,
as soon as practicable, the Required Stockholder Vote, through the execution
and delivery of written consents from all Company Stockholders, in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Stockholder Written Consents_ "). No
amendment or supplement (including any incorporated by reference) to the
Stockholder Written Consents or any of such related information will be made
without the approval of Parent. As soon as practicable following the Companys
receipt of Stockholder Written Consents, the Company will deliver to Parent
copies of such Stockholder Written Consents.

 

(c) Within one Business Day after the date hereof, the Company will deliver to
Parent Stockholder Written Consents, duly executed by all of the Major
Stockholders, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 



54 (d) Following receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval, the Company will
promptly deliver to each holder of Company Shares a notice of the approval of
the Merger and adoption of this Agreement by written consent of the holders of
Company Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, which notice must include the required notice to holders of
Company Shares required by applicable Legal Requirement that appraisal rights
may be available to holders of Company Shares in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law. Prior to the delivery of such notice to the Company
Stockholders, the Company must have given Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity (but in no event fewer than five Business Days prior to delivery
to the Company Stockholders) to review and comment on the proposed notice and
all related information proposed to be provided in connection therewith.

5.9 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, upon becoming aware of
any of the following, promptly notify Parent (i) if any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement was, when made or at any time
thereafter became, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (ii) if the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, fact, change, condition or
circumstance has caused or may reasonably be expected to cause any condition
to the obligations of Parent to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; (iii) of the failure of the Company to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or

intent of the Parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item as

that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced
to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Parties agree that if the provisions of Section 8106(c) of Title 10
of the Delaware Code (the " _Delaware Code Amendment_ ") are adopted in
substantially the form of _Schedule 8.1_ hereto, this Agreement shall be
governed by, and the Parties hereby agree to take any additional actions that

expiration of the Covenant Termination Date of such covenant, no claim under

such expiration setting forth in reasonable detail the nature of such claim
(including a reasonable specification of the legal and factual basis for such
claim). If a party has sent an Indemnification Claim Notice to another

 



63  party within the time period prescribed by this subsection (a), such claim

parties.

against and in respect of, and will compensate and reimburse the Indemnified
Persons for, any and all Damages imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered
by any Indemnified Person, directly or indirectly, whether or not due to a

8.1(b)(i)_ will be limited, in the aggregate, to $25,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ")
and (z) under  _Section 8.1(b)(vii)_ will be limited, in the aggregate, to
$5,000,000 (the " _Specified Indemnity Cap_ "), the sole recourse for which
shall be the Escrow Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Cap nor
the Specified Indemnity Cap will apply to any Excluded Matters. Subject to
_Sections 8.1(d)(v)_ and _9.6_ and without limiting the effect of any other
limitation contained in this Agreement, each Company Securityholders
indemnity obligations for Damages with respect to the Excluded Matters (other
than under _Section 8.1(d)(v)_) will be limited, in the aggregate, to amount
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration actually received by such Company
Securityholder.

 

(iv) Materiality. For the sole purpose of determining Damages (and not for
determining whether any breach for which indemnification may be available
under this _Section 8_ has occurred), any reference to materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect in the representations and warranties will be
disregarded.

 

(v) Fraud and Criminal Actions. Nothing in this Agreement will limit any
remedy any party hereto may have against any other party with respect to
fraud with intent to deceive or criminal actions committed by such party.

(vi) Damages for Taxes. Except for breaches of the representations in
_Section 2.20(h)_, any Damages with respect to Taxes shall be limited to
Damages relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 



65 (vii) Applicability of Limitations. The right to indemnification or any other
remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation
conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired, capable of being acquired,
or that is alleged the other party should have known, at any time, whether
before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements.

(e) Control of Defense; Conditions. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
5.4(c)_, which will apply to all Tax Contests, in the event that Parent or
another Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third party claim (any such
claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that Parent believes may result in a claim
for indemnification pursuant to this  _Section 8_ by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Person, Parent will promptly notify the Securityholders
Representative of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
delay in providing such notice prior to the applicable Representation
Termination Date will affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Company Securityholders are materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a reasonably
detailed description of the basis of the claim and the nature and amount, if
then reasonably ascertainable, of such Damages that may be indemnifiable. The
obligations of the Company Securityholders under this _Section 8_ with
respect to Damages arising from any Third Party Claim will be governed by the
following additional terms and conditions:

(i) The Securityholders Representative, at its option and at the expense of
the Company Securityholders, will be entitled to assume control of the defense
of any Third Party Claim at any time within 30 days of receiving notice of the
Third Party Claim from Parent and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense
any legal counsel selected by the Securityholders Representative and
reasonably acceptable to Parent. In the event that the Securityholders
Representative assumes control of the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Securityholders Representative will keep Parent informed of all material
events and developments, including promptly providing copies of any
correspondence and court filings, with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ above but subject to _Section
8.1(e)(iv)_ below, the Indemnified Person will be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; _provided_ , that such employment will be at the Indemnified Persons
own expense unless (i) the Securityholders Representative has failed to
assume (or elects not to assume) the defense and employ counsel in accordance
with _Section 8.1(e)(i)_, (ii) the named parties to any such Third Party
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company
Securityholders and the Indemnified Person and, in the opinion of counsel to
the Securityholders Representative and the Indemnified Person, there is an
actual conflict of interest between the Securityholders Representative and
the Indemnified Person, or (iii) the Indemnified Person determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim seeks
material non-monetary relief, in which case the Indemnified Person will have
the right, by notice to the

 



66  Securityholders Representative, to assume the defense of such claim and the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Persons counsel incurred in
connection with such Third Party Claim will be included in Damages;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if it is ultimately determined by agreement of
the Securityholders Representative and the Indemnified Person or by a court
of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to the Third Party Claim, such fees and
expenses will not be Damages.

 

(iii) Subject to _Section 8.1(e)(iv)_ below, neither the Securityholders
Representative nor the Indemnified Person may consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Securityholders Representative (A) shall solely control the defense of any
claim or any contact with any third party, with respect to the Specified
Indemnity Matter, and (B) may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to the Specified Matter
without the prior written consent of Parent or any Indemnified Person, in each
case of (A) and (B), as long as (x) the monetary remedy therefor that is to be
borne by Parent and any Indemnified Person does not exceed the Specified
Indemnity Cap and there are sufficient funds remaining in the Escrow Fund at
the time of such consent to satisfy such monetary remedy, (y) the settlement
or compromise does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief
against Parent or any Indemnified Person, and (z) the settlement or
compromise expressly and unconditionally releases Parent and the applicable
Indemnified Persons from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
claim, without prejudice.

 

(f) Subrogation; Insurance.

 

(i) In the event that a Company Securityholder makes any payment to any
Indemnified Person for indemnification for which such Indemnified Person
could have collected on a claim against a third party (including under any
contract and any insurance claims, but excluding any claim against an officer,
director, employee, customer, supplier, or other party (other than
insurance companies) in privity of contract with the Company or a Company
Subsidiary), such Company Securityholder will be entitled to pursue claims and
conduct litigation on behalf of such Indemnified Person to pursue and collect
on any indemnification or other remedy available to such Indemnified Person
thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the
rights of such Indemnified Person.

 

(ii) The amount of any Damages payable under this _Section 8_ will be net of
amounts received by the Indemnified Person under its applicable insurance
policies issued by insurance companies with respect to such Damages
(determined after giving effect to any deductible associated therewith, any
increase in premiums (including retropremium obligations) resulting therefrom
and net of Taxes or other liabilities incurred by such Indemnified Person
and/or any of its Affiliates as a result of such claim and out-of-pocket costs
of collecting such insurance proceeds). If an Indemnified Person receives any
amounts under applicable insurance policies issued by insurance companies
subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification payment by the indemnifying
parties, then such Indemnified Person will,

 



67  without duplication, promptly reimburse the indemnifying parties (net of
costs and expenses of such recovery and resulting premium increases) for any
payment made by such indemnifying parties up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that the aggregate amount of reimbursement
payments to the indemnifying parties in respect of any such Damages will not
in any event exceed the aggregate indemnification payment received by the
Indemnified Person from the indemnifying parties with respect to such Damages.
Nothing in this _Section 8.1(f)(ii)_ will be construed to require any Person
to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage.

 

(g) No Duplication of Recovery. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any Damages resulting from
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company under this Agreement is taken into account as Company Debt set forth
in the Closing Debt Certificate, Specified Transaction Expenses set forth
in the Closing Expense Certificate, Company Change in Control Payments set
forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet, a current liability, reserved or
accrued, or otherwise accounted for, in determining Closing Date Net Working
Capital, or on the Company Balance Sheet, or otherwise taken into account in
the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (A) no Indemnified
Person may recover such Damages through a claim pursuant to _Section 8_ or
otherwise and (B) such Damages will not be included in the determination of
whether all Damages, in the aggregate, exceed the Deductible or the Cap and
(ii) no Indemnified Person may recover duplicative Damages in respect of a
single set of facts or circumstances under more than one representation or
warranty in this Agreement, any Letter of Transmittal and/or Option
Termination Agreement regardless of whether such facts or circumstances would
give rise to a breach of more than one representation or warranty in
this Agreement, any Letter of Transmittal and/or any Option Termination
Agreement. In the event that Parent believes there are any facts or
circumstances that are the basis for any adjustments to the Estimated
Adjustment Amount in accordance with  _Section 1.5_ hereof, Parent will be
permitted to pursue a remedy based on such facts or circumstances either as an
adjustment to the Estimated Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section
1.5_ hereof or as an indemnification claim in accordance with this _Section
8_, but not both.

8.2 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnified Persons other than Parent. No
Indemnified Person (other than Parent) will be permitted to assert any
indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless
Parent consents to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.

8.3 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The parties agree that any amount
paid to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 8_ will be treated
as a reduction in the consideration payable hereunder for Tax purposes.

8.4 Mitigation. Promptly after Parent or the Surviving Corporation becomes
aware of any event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
constitute or give rise to any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 2, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate and minimize all indemnifiable Damages that may result from
such breach.

injunctive relief (without bond or other security being required and without

otherwise, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of limitations or
other limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or

be charged with such waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the failure of a party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist

a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of any other term of
condition hereof (whether or not similar).
