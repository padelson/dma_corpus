Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Not later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Contributor Parties shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Acquiror a
preliminary settlement statement (the " ** _Estimated Adjustment Statement_**
") setting forth (i) an estimated combined balance sheet of the Compression
Group Entities as of the Closing Date, which balance sheet will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the Contributor PartiesÂ’ past
practices (including its preparation of the Unaudited Financial Statements)
(the " ** _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_** ") based on the most recent
financial information of the Compression Group Entities reasonably available
to the Contributor Parties and the Contributor PartiesÂ’ reasonable estimates
with respect to the assets, liabilities and membersÂ’ equity of the Compression
Group Entities as of the Closing Date, (ii) a calculation of the difference,
if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet (the " ** _Estimated Net Working Capital_** ") and the Net
Working Capital Threshold, (iii) a calculation of the Debt shown on the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " ** _Estimated Closing Date Debt_**
"), (iv) a calculation of the Cash shown on the Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet (the " ** _Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount_** ") and (v) a
calculation of the estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. Acquiror shall
have the right, following AcquirorÂ’s receipt of the Estimated Adjustment
Statement, to object thereto by delivering written notice to ETP, on behalf of
the Contributor Parties, no later than two Business Days before the Closing
Date. To the extent Acquiror timely objects to the Estimated Adjustment
Statement (or any component thereof), Acquiror and ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, shall enter into good faith negotiations and attempt to
resolve any such objection; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Acquiror and ETP,
on behalf of the Contributor Parties, are unable to resolve such objection
prior to the Closing Date, then the Contributor PartiesÂ’ calculations as
reflected in the

 



      
 

 



 

Estimated Adjustment Statement shall control solely for purposes of the
payments to be made at Closing. To the extent Acquiror and ETP, on behalf of
the Contributor Parties, resolve any such objection prior to the Closing, then
the Parties shall jointly agree on a revised Estimated Adjustment Statement
that shall control solely for purposes of the payments to be made at the
Closing. The estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount that controls for
purposes of the payments to be made at the Closing is referred to herein as
the " ** _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_**."

 



 

(b) Not later than the 120th day following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
prepare and deliver to ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, a statement
(the " ** _Final Adjustment Statement_** ") setting forth (i) the final
combined balance sheet of the Compression Group Entities as of the Closing
Date, which balance sheet will be prepared in the same manner as the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " ** _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_** ")
based on the most recent financial information of the Compression Group
Entities reasonably available to Acquiror, (ii) a calculation of the
difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing
Date Balance Sheet and Estimated Net Working Capital, (iii) a calculation of
the difference, if any, between the Debt shown on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Date Debt, (iv) a calculation of the
difference, if any, between the Cash shown on the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Closing Date Cash Amount and (v) the final calculation
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. At any time during the 30-day period
following receipt of the Final Adjustment Statement (the " ** _Review
Period_** "), ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, may deliver to
Acquiror a written report containing any changes that the Contributor Parties
propose be made to the Final Adjustment Statement (such written report, an "
** _Objection Notice_** "). Acquiror shall provide to ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, such documentation and other data, and, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, access to its officers,
employees, agents and other personnel as is reasonably necessary to enable
ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, to appropriately review the Final
Adjustment Statement during the Review Period. ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object to
the Final Adjustment Statement unless ETP, on behalf of the Contributor
Parties, delivers an Objection Notice to Acquiror within the Review Period
and, if the Review Period expires without ETP, on behalf of the Contributor
Parties, so delivering an Objection Notice, then from and after the expiration
of the Review Period, the Final Adjustment Statement shall become final and
binding for all purposes of this Agreement. If ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, delivers an Objection Notice to Acquiror during the
Review Period, then ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, and Acquiror
shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall attempt to agree on the
amount of the actual Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. If such Parties cannot
reach agreement within 30 days after the date on which ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, delivered such Objection Notice to Acquiror, the Parties
shall refer the remaining disputed matters necessary to the final
determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount to Deloitte and Touche
LLP, or if Deloitte and Touche LLP is unable or unwilling to perform its
obligations under this _Section 2.4(b)_, such other nationally-recognized
independent accounting firm as is mutually agreed on by ETP, on behalf of the
Contributor Parties, and Acquiror (the " ** _Independent Accounting Firm_**
"). The Independent Accounting Firm shall resolve any disputes referred to it
under this _Section 2.4(b)_. Each Party shall deliver simultaneously to the
Independent Accounting Firm (i) the Objection Notice and such work papers,
invoices and other reports and information relating to the disputed matters as
the Independent Accounting Firm may request and (ii) such PartyÂ’s proposed
resolution of the disputed matters and any materials it wishes to present

 



      
 

 



 

to justify the resolution it so presents. Each Party shall be afforded the
opportunity to discuss the disputed matters with the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert (and not as an
arbitrator) for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
matters necessary to the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
submitted by either ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, or Acquiror to
the Independent Accounting Firm, and whether and to what extent, if any, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount requires adjustment as a result of the
resolution of those disputed matters (applying GAAP consistently with the
Compression Group EntitiesÂ’ past practices). The Independent Accounting Firm
may not award damages or penalties and shall not have authority to address
matters not in dispute between the Parties or necessary to the determination
of the final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. The Independent Accounting
FirmÂ’s determination shall be made within 30 days after submission of the
disputed matters and shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right
of appeal. In determining the proper amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not increase the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount more than the increase proposed to be made in the Final
Adjustment Statement by ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, nor
decrease the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount more than the decrease proposed
to be made in the Final Adjustment Statement by Acquiror, as applicable. Each
Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to
the Independent Accounting Firm. Acquiror and ETP shall each bear one-half of
the costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm incurred in
resolving such disputed matters. The Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be referred to as
the " ** _Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_**."

 



 

(c) Within three Business Days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of the
Review Period without delivery of any Objection Notice and (ii) the date on
which ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, and Acquiror, or the
Independent Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally determine the actual
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (A) if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount (such excess,
the " ** _Contributor Adjustment Payment_** "), Acquiror shall wire transfer
in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Contributor Adjustment
Payment to an account designated by ETP and (B) if the Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
(such excess, the " ** _Acquiror Adjustment Payment_** "), ETP shall wire
transfer in immediately available funds an amount equal to the Acquiror
Adjustment Payment to an account designated by Acquiror.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Acquiror is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any
Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Tax Treatment of Contribution_.

 



 

(a) The Parties intend, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, that the
Contribution shall be treated consistent with (i) a contribution by ETP to
Acquiror of a portion of the Subject Interests in exchange for the Equity
Consideration in a transaction consistent with the

 



      
 

 



 

requirements of Section 721(a) of the Code and (ii) a sale by ETP to Acquiror
of a portion of the Subject Interests in exchange for the Closing Cash
Consideration (which Closing Cash Consideration includes an amount intended to
represent (A) a "debt-financed transfer" pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.707-5(b) (as described in detail in _Section 2.6(b)_) and (B) a
reimbursement of pre-formation capital expenditures with respect to the assets
of the Compression Group Entities to the maximum extent provided by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-4(d) (as described in detail in _Section 2.6(b))_).

 



 

(b) Acquiror intends to incur a borrowing or borrowings with respect to the
transactions contemplated by _Section 2.1_, which will be considered non-
recourse debt within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-1 (the "
** _Transaction Debt_** "). The Parties intend that (i) (A) the distribution
of the Closing Cash Consideration to ETP shall be treated, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.163-8T and Notice 89-35 (Part VI), 1989-1 C.B.
675, as being made first out of proceeds of the Transaction Debt, and that
such distribution shall qualify to the maximum extent possible as a "debt-
financed transfer" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(b) and (B) ETPÂ’s
allocable share of the Transaction Debt under Treasury Regulation Sections
1.752-2 and 1.707-5T(a)(2)(i) shall be determined in accordance with ETPÂ’s
interest in AcquirorÂ’s profits, as determined by Acquiror GP; and (ii) the
distribution of the Closing Cash Consideration to ETP in excess of amounts of
the Transaction Debt as set forth in clause (i) hereof, if any, shall be made
to reimburse ETP for capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-4(d) to the extent such distribution does not exceed the amount
of capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d).

 



 

(c) The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and otherwise act at all times
in a manner consistent with the intended Tax treatment set forth in this
_Section 2.6_, and no Party shall take any position that is inconsistent with
such Tax treatment except to the extent otherwise required by Law.

in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the ownership, operation or leasing of its assets and
properties requires it to so qualify, except with respect to _clause (iii)_
where the failure to be so duly qualified and in good standing would not
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents to which any Contributor Party is, or will be, a
party or materially impair the ability of any Contributor Party to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is,

 



      
 

 



 

or will be, a party. The Contributor Parties have made available to Acquiror
true and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of each Compression

Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which each Contributor Party
is or will be a party and the performance by such Contributor Party of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized by the general
partner of such Contributor Party, and no other proceedings on the part of
such Contributor Party are necessary to authorize such execution, delivery and
performance. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which each
Contributor Party is party have been or will be duly executed and delivered by

parties hereto and thereto, constitute or will constitute such Contributor
PartyÂ’s valid and binding obligation, enforceable against such Contributor
Party in accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

Section 3.3 _No Conflict or Violation_. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which

any Material Contract; (d) result in the creation or imposition of any
Encumbrance (other than any Permitted Encumbrance) upon any of the properties

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Compression Group Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the

Contributor Party is, or will be, a party or to materially impair the ability
of any Contributor Party to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or will be, a party.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Except (a) for any filings required to
be made under the HSR Act or (b) for any filings required for compliance with
any applicable requirements of the federal securities laws, any applicable
state or other local securities laws and any applicable requirements of a
national securities exchange, neither the execution and delivery of this

thereunder, requires the consent,

 



      
 

 



 

approval, waiver, authorization or notification of, or declaration, filing,
registration or qualification with, any Governmental Authority or any similar
Person, by any of the Contributor Parties.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Ownership of the Subject Interests_.

of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Compression Group
Entity. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(a)_ , there are no outstanding
equity interests of any Compression Group Entity.

 



 

(b) The Compression Group Entities do not own, of record or beneficially, any
direct or indirect equity or other interest or any right (contingent or
otherwise) to acquire the same, in any other Person. Neither Compression Group
Entity is a member of (nor is any part of the Compression Business conducted

in any Compression Group Entity, and no securities or obligations evidencing
such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. There are no preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal or other outstanding options, warrants,

(iii) have been prepared from, and in accordance with, the books and records
of the Compression Group Entities.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2016, (i) there has not been or occurred any event or

material to the Compression Business.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, since December 31, 2016 and through the
date of this Agreement, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(a)_, none of the
Contributor Parties (in each case solely with respect to the Compression Group
Entities and the Compression Business) have taken, or agreed or committed to

Section 3.9 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 



 

(a) The operations of the Compression Group Entities are being, and since
December 31, 2016 have been, conducted in material compliance with all
applicable Laws, including those relating to the use, ownership, and operation
of their respective assets and properties. None of the Contributor Parties or
the Compression Group Entities nor any of their

 



      
 

 



 

respective Affiliates have received written notice of any material violation
of any applicable Law related to any Compression Group Entity. To the
Knowledge of the Contributor Parties, except as set forth on _Schedule
3.9(a)_, none of the Compression Group Entities is under investigation by any
Governmental Authority for potential material non-compliance with any Law.

 



 

(b) The Compression Group Entities are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders (the " ** _Permits_** ")
necessary in any material respect to own, lease and operate their assets and
properties and to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted. To the Knowledge of the Contributor Parties, there are no
conditions or circumstances under which any such Permit could be revoked or
any pending application for any new Permit or renewal of an existing Permit
that could reasonably be expected to be protested or denied, except for any
such revocation, protest or denial that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Compression Business.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3.9_ do not
address tax matters or environmental matters, which are addressed only in
_Section 3.10_ and _Section 3.15_, respectively.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Tax Matters_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10_:

 



 

(a) (i) All material Tax Returns required by applicable Law to be filed by or
with respect to the Compression Group Entities have been duly and timely filed
(taking into account any extensions of time within which to file) and such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all material respects; (ii) all material
Taxes owed by or with respect to the Compression Group Entities (or for which
any such entity may be liable) which are or have become due have been paid in
full; (iii) all material Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited
by or with respect to the Compression Group Entities have been timely
withheld, collected or deposited as the case may be, and to the extent
required, have been paid to the relevant Tax Authority; (iv) there are no
liens (other than Permitted Encumbrances for current period Taxes not yet due
and payable) on any of the assets of the Compression Group Entities that arose
in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax; (v) there
is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit, dispute or claim

extending the applicable statutory periods of limitation for any material
Taxes associated with the Compression Group Entities.

 



 

(b) No Claim has ever been made in writing by a taxing authority in a
jurisdiction in which a Compression Group Entity does not file Tax Returns
that a Compression Group Entity is or may be required to file a Tax Return in
that jurisdiction.

 



 

(c) There is not in force any extension of time with respect to the due date
for the filing of any Tax Return of or with respect to any Compression Group
Entity or any waiver or agreement for any extension of time for the assessment
or payment of any Tax of or with respect to any Compression Group Entity.

 



 

(d) No Compression Group Entity is a party to any Tax sharing agreement or Tax
indemnity agreement nor do they have any material continuing obligations under
such

 



      
 

 



 

agreements. No power of attorney related to Taxes which is currently in force
has been granted by any Compression Group Entity. No Compression Group Entity
has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income
tax return, and except for any intragroup liability pursuant to Texas
franchise tax combined reporting obligations, the Compression Group Entities
have no liability for the Taxes of any other Person, whether under Treasury
Regulations 1.1502-6, as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(e) For the most recent four complete calendar quarters for which financial
information is available, at least 90% of the combined gross income of the
Compression Group Entities has been income which is "qualifying income" within
the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code.

 



 

(f) No Compression Group Entity has been a party to a transaction that is a
"reportable transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) or any predecessor thereto.

 



 

(g) Each Compression Group Entity has been treated as a partnership or as an
entity disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes at all times since its respective formation, and none of the
Compression Group Entities has elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S.
federal, state or local Tax purposes.

 



 

This _Section 3.10_ constitutes the Contributor PartiesÂ’ sole and exclusive
representations and warranties regarding Taxes, Tax Returns and any other Tax
matter of the Compression Group Entities.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Compression Group Entity
has any indebtedness or liability, absolute or contingent, which is not shown
or provided for in the Unaudited Financial Statements, other than (a) as set
forth on _Schedule 3.11_ or (b) liabilities that have arisen since September
30, 2017 in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
including liens for current taxes and assessments not in default, which are
not, individually or in the aggregate, material in amount.

 



 

Section 3.12 _Employees; Employee Plans_.

 



 

(a) No Compression Group Entity or Contributor Party currently has, or has
within the past three years had, any employees.

 



 

(b) _Schedule 3.12(b)_ contains a complete and accurate list of all Subject
Employees as of the Execution Date. The Subject Employees represent the
entirety of the individuals whose employment materially involves providing
services principally related to the management or operation of the Compression
Business.

 



 

(c) Other than the individuals set forth on _Schedule 3.12(c)_ , there are no
individuals engaged as independent contractors who provide material services
to any Compression Group Entity.

 



 

(d) None of the Subject Employees are employed pursuant to the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor union, and no
Compression Group

 



       
 

 



 

Entity has agreed to recognize any union or other collective bargaining
representative with respect to any Subject Employee. No collective bargaining
agreements are being negotiated by any of the Compression Group Entities or
any Contributor Parties with respect to the Subject Employees, and no union or
other collective bargaining representative, to the Knowledge of the
Contributor Parties, is attempting to organize or has been certified as the
bargaining representative of any Subject Employee. There has been no labor
strike, work stoppage, slowdown, walkout, lockout or similar labor activity
involving any Subject Employee during the past three years, nor is any such
labor strike, work stoppage, slowdown, walkout, lockout or similar labor
activity involving any Subject Employee now occurring or, to the Knowledge of
the Contributor Parties, threatened.

 



 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to the Compression Group Entities, with respect to the Subject Employees, each
of the Compression Group Entities is and as at all times has been in
compliance with all applicable labor and employment Laws, including, without
limitation, all Laws, rules, regulations, orders, rulings, decrees, judgments
and awards relating to employment discrimination, non-retaliation,
recordkeeping, employee leave, payment of wages, hours of work, overtime
compensation, immigration, occupational health and safety, and wrongful
discharge. As of the Closing Date, each Subject Employee and other individual
whose employment has principally involved providing services with respect to
the Compression Business will have been paid all wages, bonuses, and other
compensation owed for all services provided with respect to any Compression
Group Entity. No Compression Group Entity is, or has within the past three

year-end audit adjustments that are not individually or in the aggregate
material). As of the Execution Date, there are no outstanding or unresolved

agreement nor does any Acquiror Entity have any material continuing
obligations under such agreements. No power of attorney related to Taxes which

protection against disclosure, or interfere with the normal operations of
Acquiror, its Affiliates and the Compression Group Entities and the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of Acquiror, its Affiliates and the Compression Group
Entities incurred in connection therewith shall be paid by ETP. Acquiror shall
cause the Compression Group Entities to maintain and preserve all such Tax

after the Closing Date and (ii) any applicable statutory or regulatory
retention period, as the same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer
to transfer such records to the Contributor Parties at the end of any such
period.

Section 5.12 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to
be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Compression Group
Entities for any Straddle Period and any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are due
after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practices of the Compression Group Entities, except
to the extent required by applicable Law. Acquiror shall provide the
Contributor Parties a copy of the draft of such Tax Returns (including the
allocation of the Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period) for review not
later than fifteen (15) days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns
(including extensions). Acquiror shall reflect any reasonable comment that a
Contributor Party submits to Acquiror no less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the due date of any such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Return. Acquiror
shall consider in good faith any comment

 



       
 

 



 

that a Contributor Party submits to Acquiror no less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return. Except for
Transfer Taxes, responsibility for which shall be allocated pursuant to
_Section 5.12(c)_, the Contributor Parties shall pay the Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent such Taxes are included as a current liability in
the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital or arise from the
operations of or transactions by the Compression Group Entities after the
Closing.

 



 

(ii) Acquiror shall not (and shall neither cause nor permit the Compression
Group Entities to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return
previously filed with any Tax Authority relating in whole or part to the
Compression Group Entities with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without
the written consent of a Contributor Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(b) _Tax Allocation_.

 



 

(i) With respect to the Compression Group Entities and the assets of the
Compression Group Entities, the Contributor Parties shall be allocated and
bear all Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and Acquiror shall
be allocated and bear all Taxes attributable to any Tax period or portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date. The Contributor Parties shall
defend, indemnify and hold Acquiror harmless from and against and be liable
for all Liability arising out of or related to any and all Taxes (or the non-
payment thereof) (1) of or with respect to the Compression Group Entities or
the assets of the Compression Group Entities for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods,
(2) attributable to any failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of
the Contributor Parties (including any obligation to cause any of the
Compression Group Entities to take, or refrain from taking, any action under
this Agreement), (3) as a result of any Compression Group Entity (or any
predecessor of any Compression Group Entity) being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or foreign law or regulation, and (4) of any Person imposed on
any of the Compression Group Entities for any period as a transferee or
successor with respect to a transaction occurring before the Closing Date, by
applicable Law, contract or otherwise; _provided however_ , notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Contributor Parties shall not
be required to defend, indemnify or hold Acquiror harmless from or against or
be liable for (x) Taxes that are included as a current liability in the
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, or (y) Transfer Taxes
allocable to Acquiror pursuant to _Section 5.12(c)_.

 



 

(ii) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, gain, profits, receipts, employment, social security,
payroll, sales, use, or other transaction-based Taxes of the Compression Group
Entities for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined based on a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and the amount of other Taxes of the Compression
Group Entities for a Straddle Period that relates to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period and the

 



      
 

 



 

balance of such Taxes shall be attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (" ** _Transfer Taxes_**
") shall be borne 50% by the Contributor Parties and 50% by Acquiror, and
Acquiror and the Contributor Parties shall, at their own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer
Taxes, and, if required by applicable law, the Parties agree to join in the
execution of any such Tax Return and other documentation.

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
to the extent that Acquiror or any of the Compression Group Entities receives
any Tax refund or Tax credit relating to or attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Acquiror shall immediately pay such amount to the Contributor Parties
to the extent the Base Cash Consideration has not been increased pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ on account thereof. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of any
of the Compression Group Entities for any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date shall be for the account of Acquiror. The amount of any refund of
Taxes of any of the Compression Group Entities for any Straddle Period shall
be equitably apportioned between Acquiror and the Contributor Parties in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 5.12(b)_. Each Party
shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the Party
entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this _Section 5.12(d)_ the
amount of such refund within 30 days after such refund is received, net any
reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such party or its Affiliates in
procuring such refund. Upon the reasonable request of a Contributor Party, and
at such Contributor PartyÂ’s expense, Acquiror shall cause the Compression
Group Entities to file a claim for refund or credit of any Taxes, including
through the filing of amended Tax Returns or otherwise, relating to such
companies or their assets or operations for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in such
form as such Contributor Party may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Acquiror shall not be required to cause the Compression Group Entities to file
any such claim, if such filing would result in any liability or unreimbursed
cost (including any increased Taxes) to Acquiror.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. Prior to the destruction or discarding of any books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Contributor Parties
relating to any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date, each
Party shall give the other Party reasonable written notice and, if the other
Party so requests, shall itself allow the other Party to take, possession of
such books and records. Acquiror and the Contributor Parties further agree,
upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on
the Contributor Parties or Acquiror as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or for any taxable period of the Contributor beginning on
or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Election_. Acquiror shall make, or shall cause to be made, for the
taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs, an election under Section
168(k)(7) of the Code with respect to the class or classes of property to
which the assets of the Compression Group Entities belong; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that ETP may, in its sole discretion, consent to permit Acquiror
to not make the election described in this _Section 5.12(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.13 _NYSE Listing_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause (a) the Acquiror Common Units constituting a portion of the Equity
Consideration and (b) the Acquiror Class B Conversion Units to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Contributor Parties shall, as promptly as practicable following any
request of Acquiror from time to time prior to Closing, prepare and deliver to
Acquiror any annual or interim financial statements that will be required of
Acquiror by the SEC in connection with reports, registration statements and
other filings to be made by Acquiror with respect to the Compression Group
Entities and the Compression Business with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act (such annual and interim financial statements, the "
** _Special Financial Statements_** "). The Contributor Parties (i) shall
cooperate with and permit Acquiror to reasonably participate in the
preparation of the Special Financial Statements and (ii) shall provide
Acquiror and its representatives with reasonable access to the personnel of
the Contributor Parties and the Compression Group Entities who engage in the
preparation of the Special Financial Statements.

 



 

(b) The Contributor Parties and the Compression Group Entities, as applicable,
shall execute and promptly deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to
the Acquiror Accounting Firm and the ETP Accounting Firm such representation
letters, in form and substance customary for representation letters provided
to external audit firms by management of ETP (if the financial statements are
the subject of an audit or are the subject of a review pursuant to Statement
of Accounting Standards 100 (Interim Financial Information)), as may be
reasonably requested by the Acquiror Accounting Firm or the ETP Accounting
Firm with respect to the Special Financial Statements. Acquiror agrees that to
the extent any such representation letter is delivered by the management of
any Contributor Party or Compression Group Entity, or on such managementÂ’s
behalf, Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless such management and provide
a defense for management with regard to the execution, delivery or any other
action related to the provision of such representation letters to the same
extent as any executive officer or director of Acquiror would be indemnified
had they performed such action.

 



 

(c) The Contributor Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the ETP Accounting Firm to provide its written consent for the use of any
audit reports with respect to the Special Financial Statements in reports,
registration statements or other documents filed by Acquiror under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as necessary.

 



 

(d) The Contributor Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Acquiror in connection with the preparation by Acquiror of any pro forma
financial statements of Acquiror that are derived in part from the financial
statements of the Compression Group Entities that Acquiror reasonably
determines are required to be included or incorporated by reference in any
registration statement, report or other filing of Acquiror to satisfy any rule
or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 



 

(e) The Contributor Parties and the Compression Group Entities shall provide
access to their books and records as may be reasonably necessary for Acquiror
or any of its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to conduct customary due

 



      
 

 



 

diligence with respect to any Special Financial Statements in connection with
any offering of securities by Acquiror or to enable an accounting firm to
prepare and deliver a customary comfort letter with respect to the Special
Financial Statements.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.14_, from
and after the Closing, the Contributor Parties will at AcquirorÂ’s sole expense
take such further actions as are reasonably requested by Acquiror, to assist
Acquiror in the preparation of any financial statements that will be required
of Acquiror by the SEC in connection with reports, registration statements and
other filings to be made by Acquiror with respect to the Compression Group
Entities and the Compression Business with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Acquisition Financing shall not be deemed to operate in any way as a condition
to the obligation of Acquiror to consummate the Closing, except to the extent
that the failure by the Contributor Parties to perform and comply in all
material respects with their covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to
this _Section 5.15_ results in the failure of the condition set forth in
_Section 6.2(b)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.15_ to the contrary, the
Contributor Parties shall not be obligated to furnish Acquiror and the
Financing Sources with the Audited Financial Statements until March 1, 2018.

Entities to leave the employment of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
(including the Compression Group Entities following the Closing); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.16_ shall prevent a Restricted
Party from soliciting, engaging or employing: (a) any individual whose
employment with the Acquiror Entities or the Compression Group Entities or
other post-Closing Affiliate of Acquiror has terminated other than as a result

Section 5.17 _Amendment of Schedules_. Each Party agrees that, with respect to
the respective representations and warranties of any other Party contained in
this Agreement, such other Party shall have the continuing right and
obligation until the Closing to add, supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to any matter arising solely after the date of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement which, if existing at the date of this Agreement or thereafter,
would have been required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure
Schedule. Any such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure (except with
respect to _Section 3.8_ and _Section 4.11_, respectively) shall be deemed
to have cured any breach of any representation or warranty for purposes of
indemnification and termination rights contained in this Agreement and of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.2_, as applicable, have been satisfied to the extent that they
reflect actions taken by such Party or any of its respective Affiliates as
required or permitted under this Agreement. Any other such additional,
supplemental or amended disclosure (including with respect to _Section 3.8_
and _Section 4.11_, respectively) shall not be deemed to have cured any
breach of any representation or warranty made as of the date of this Agreement
for purposes of indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2_ have been satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if such
additional, supplemental or amended disclosures would give rise to a right for
either ETP, on behalf of Contributor Parties, or Acquiror to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_, respectively,
assuming (i) all other conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.2_ had been satisfied, (ii) the Closing were scheduled to occur on the date
that such additional, supplemental or amended disclosures were received by the
Contributor Parties or Acquiror, as applicable, and (iii) the matters
disclosed in such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure were not
cured, then ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, or Acquiror, as
applicable, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within 10
Business Days of its receipt of such additional, supplemental or amended
disclosure and (b) if ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, or Acquiror,
as applicable, does not so elect to terminate this Agreement, then ETP, on
behalf of the Contributor Parties, or Acquiror, as applicable, shall be deemed
to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect
to such matters. Upon becoming aware of such matters, the Contributor Parties
or Acquiror, as applicable shall promptly deliver additions, supplements or
amendments to the Disclosure Schedules the Contributor Parties or Acquiror, as
applicable.

Closing, with such offers to be effective as of the Closing Date. Each such
offer of employment that (i) is no less than the base compensation and annual
cash bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, provided to similarly situated
(including, but not limited to, geography) employees of Acquiror or Acquiror
Management (as applicable), (ii) provides for base compensation and an annual
cash bonus opportunity that are, in the aggregate, at least equal to eighty
percent (80%) of those in effect for such Subject Employee immediately prior
to the Closing, and (iii) provides for a principal place of employment that is
no more than

 



      
 

 



 

fifty (50) miles from such Subject EmployeeÂ’s principal place of employment as
of immediately prior to Closing shall constitute a " ** _Qualifying Offer_**."
Each Subject Employee who accepts AcquirorÂ’s (or Acquiror ManagementÂ’s) offer
of employment and commences employment with an Acquiror Entity on or after the
Closing Date (including any Executive/Sales Employee and any Operational
Support Employee who receives and accepts an offer of employment pursuant to
_Section 5.18(b)_ or _Section 5.18(c)_ below) shall be referred to herein as
a " ** _Transferred Employee_**." Acquiror and the Contributor Parties intend
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not result in a
severance of employment of any Transferred Employee for purposes of any
Contributor Employee Benefit Plan and that the Transferred Employees shall
have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the Closing, and Acquiror and the Contributor Parties shall
use reasonable efforts to ensure the same. For the avoidance of doubt, the
prior sentence in no way obligates Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to employ
any Transferred Employee for any length of service.

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Acquiror and ETE shall
discuss in good faith which (if any) Executive/Sales Employees to whom
Acquiror shall, or shall cause Acquiror Management to, make offers of
employment. Until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following the Closing
Date and (ii) the date such Executive/Sales Employee accepts an offer of
employment pursuant to this _Section 5.18(b_), the Executive/Sales Employees
shall be available in the ordinary course to provide support to the
Compression Group Entities in accordance with their normal duties. Acquiror
shall reimburse the Contributor Parties for those costs and expenses set forth
on _Schedule 5.18(b)_ incurred by the Contributor Parties with respect to the
Executive/Sales Employees until, except as otherwise provided on _Schedule
5.18(b)_ , the earlier to occur of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date or (ii) the date any such Executive/Sales Employee
accepts an offer of employment pursuant to this _Section 5.18(b)_.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the earlier of (i) the end of the Transition Services
Period or (ii) the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, Acquiror
may make, or cause Acquiror Management to make, offers of employment to such
Operational Support Employees (if any) as it selects in its discretion.

 



 

(d) To the extent that any Operational Employee or Operational Support
Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee is terminated by Acquiror or
Acquiror Management in good faith during the sixty (60) day period following
the Closing Date, the Contributor Parties will reimburse Acquiror or Acquiror
Management, as applicable, for the amount of severance that such Transferred
Employee would have been entitled to receive immediately prior to the Closing
under the Energy Transfer Non-Midstream Business Severance Plan dated
September 11, 2015, as amended and restated January 1, 2018 (the " **
_Severance Plan_** ") as if such Transferred Employee had incurred a
qualifying termination entitling such employee to severance under the
Severance Plan (a " ** _Qualifying Termination_** ") on the Closing Date plus
the employer portion of any payroll, employment, social security or
unemployment Taxes associated with such payment; _provided_ , that,
Contributor Parties have delivered to Acquiror information sufficient
calculate and pay such severance. In the event of any such termination,
Acquiror or Acquiror Management will timely provide to the Contributor Parties
a written statement notifying the Contributor Parties of such termination,
confirming, if applicable, that the applicable Transferred Employee executed
an effective and irrevocable Severance Release in accordance with _Section
5.18(e)_ below, and indicating the amount of such severance, and the
Contributor Parties

 



      
 

 



 

will, within ten (10) business days after receiving such statement, reimburse
Acquiror or Acquiror Management for such amounts in full satisfaction of its
obligations under this _Section 5.18(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, neither
Acquiror nor Acquiror Management shall have any obligation or liability with
respect to any severance payable to a Subject Employee whose employment is
terminated by a Contributor Party or its Affiliate (including by reason of
AcquirorÂ’s or Acquiror ManagementÂ’s failure to make a Qualifying Offer to such
Subject Employee or such Subject EmployeeÂ’s non-acceptance of AcquirorÂ’s or
Acquiror ManagementÂ’s offer of employment).

 



 

(e) For a period of no less than twelve (12) months following the Closing, an
Acquiror Entity shall provide to each Transferred Employee other than an
Executive/Sales Employee (i) base compensation and an annual cash bonus
opportunity that (x) are no less than the base compensation and annual cash
bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, provided to similarly situated
(including, but not limited to, geography) employees of Acquiror or Acquiror
Management (as applicable), and (y) are, in the aggregate, at least equal to
eighty percent (80%) of those in effect for such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) employee benefits (including,
without limitation, health, welfare and retirement benefits, but excluding
severance benefits discussed in the following sentence) that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to similarly situated
(including, but not limited to, geography) employees of Acquiror. Subject to
_Section 5.18(d)_ above, in the event that an Acquiror Entity or an Affiliate
thereof terminates, without cause, the employment of a Transferred Employee
other than an Executive/Sales Employee during the twelve (12)-month period
following the Closing in a termination under circumstances that would
constitute a Qualifying Termination, subject to the applicable Transferred
EmployeeÂ’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror in favor of Acquiror, ETE, ETP and their
respective Affiliates (a " ** _Severance Release_** ") which becomes effective
no later than sixty (60) days following such termination, the applicable
Acquiror Entity or such Affiliate will pay or provide severance payments and
benefits to such Transferred Employee that are no less favorable than the
severance payments and benefits that such Transferred Employee would have been
entitled to receive immediately prior to the Closing under the Severance Plan
as if such Transferred Employee had incurred a Qualifying Termination on the
Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Acquiror shall cause each Transferred Employee (i) to be credited under
any Acquiror Employee Benefit Plan for his or her period of employment with
the Contributor Parties or any of their Affiliates (and their respective
predecessors) before the Closing as if such Transferred Employee was so
employed by the Acquiror Entities for all purposes for which such service was
recognized by the Contributor Parties or any of their Affiliates (and their
respective predecessors), except for service for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit plan of the Acquiror Entities and except to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits; (ii) to be
immediately eligible to participate in all Acquiror Employee Benefit Plans
generally available to similarly-situated employees of the Acquiror Entities
on the same terms and conditions as such similarly-situated employees, without
waiting periods or exclusions or limitations for pre-existing conditions or
actively-at-work requirements; and (iii) to the extent permitted by the terms
of the applicable Acquiror Employee Benefit Plan, along with his or her
eligible dependents, as applicable, to be credited under any Acquiror Employee
Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan for any co-payments, deductibles
and other eligible expenses incurred by such Transferred Employee (or his or
her eligible dependents) under any corresponding Contributor Employee Benefit
Plan during the plan year which includes the Closing Date, in each case, to
the extent the

 



      
 

 



 

Contributor Parties or any of their Affiliates delivers to Acquiror
information sufficient to credit, as applicable, such service or payments.

 



 

(g) The Contributor Parties shall pay to each Transferred Employee such
Transferred EmployeeÂ’s accrued but unpaid vacation, sick time and/or paid-
time-off, in each case, as of the Closing Date (or, if later, the date on
which the Contributor Parties terminate such Transferred EmployeeÂ’s
employment) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable
policies of the Contributor Parties or ETP or its Affiliates and applicable
Law. Effective as of the Closing Date (or, if later, the date on which the
applicable Transferred Employee commences employment with the Acquiror
Entity), Transferred Employees shall begin to accrue vacation, sick time and
paid-time-off in accordance with the applicable Acquiror EntityÂ’s policies and
procedures, as in effect from time to time.

 



 

(h) Effective no later than the Closing Date, Acquiror shall establish or
designate a defined contribution retirement plan which is qualified or
eligible for qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " **
_Acquiror 401(k) Plan_**"). Effective as of, and as soon as practicable
following, the Closing Date, the Contributor Parties shall cause the trustees
of each Contributor Employee Benefit Plan which is qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and in which any Transferred Employee participates prior to
the Closing (each, a " ** _Contributor 401(k) Plan_**") to transfer to the
trustees or other funding agent of the Acquiror 401(k) Plan the amounts
representing the account balances of the Transferred Employees participating
in such Contributor 401(k) Plan, with such amounts to be established as
account balances or accrued benefits of such individuals under the Acquiror
401(k) Plan. Each such transfer shall comply with Section 414(1) of the Code
and the requirements of ERISA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Any
Transferred Employee with an outstanding loan under a Contributor 401(k) Plan
as of immediately prior to the Closing shall be entitled to have such loan
transferred to the Acquiror 401(k) Plan, effective as of, and as soon as
practicable following, the Closing Date, and Acquiror shall maintain such loan
under the Acquiror 401(k) Plan under the same terms and conditions as applied
to such loan under the Contributor 401(k) Plan (and the Contributor 401(k)
Plan(s) and/or the Acquiror 401(k) Plan shall be amended to the extent
necessary to effect such transfer). Until the time of such transfer, Acquiror
shall make payroll deductions in respect of required payments under any such
loan and forward such amounts to the Contributor Parties as payments on such
loan.

 



 

(i) ETP and the selling group (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, QandA-2(c)) shall be solely responsible for satisfying obligations
under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code to provide

Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-2(c)) shall be solely responsible for
satisfying obligations under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of

sixtieth (60th) day following the Closing Date.

 



 

(j) Acquiror and its Affiliates shall be responsible for complying with WARN

Contributor Parties by the average of the closing price of the common units of
ETP on the NYSE for the ninety (90) day period immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the " ** _Award Value_** "). The Acquiror shall then issue the
Equity Make Up Award valued at the Award Value utilizing AcquirorÂ’s standard

PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT (A) SUCH LOST PROFITS OR DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED IN ANY
ACTION BY A THIRD PARTY AGAINST SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR WHICH IT IS
ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) SUCH LOST PROFITS OR
DAMAGES (OTHER THAN PUNITIVE DAMAGES) ARISE FROM OR RELATE TO, AND ARE THE
PROBABLE AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE (OR WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE
PARTIES) CONSEQUENCE OF, THE BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Indemnification Procedure._

 



 

(a) Each Indemnified Party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of
facts giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_, such Indemnified Party will assert its claim for
indemnification under this _Article VII_ (each, a " ** _Claim_** ") by
providing a written notice (a " ** _Claim Notice_** ") within the designated
survival period for such Claim to the applicable indemnifying Party (the " **
_Indemnifying Party_** ") specifying, in reasonable detail, to the extent
known by such Indemnifying Party, the nature and basis for such Claim ( _e.g._
, the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to
have been breached). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified PartyÂ’s
delay in sending a Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
Liability hereunder with respect to such Claim except to the extent (and
limited solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
delay provided that such Claim Notice is provided within the applicable
survival period described in _Section 7.3(d)(i)_.

 



 

(b) In the event that any Proceeding is instituted or any Claim is asserted by
any Third Party in respect of which indemnification may be sought under
_Section 7.2_ and in respect of which the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to indemnify the Indemnified Party for all of such Indemnified PartyÂ’s
Losses (subject to any applicable limitations in this _Article VII_) (a " **
_Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnifying Party will have the right, at such
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, to assume the defense of same including the
appointment and selection of counsel on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third Party
Claim, it shall within 30 days notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
intent to do so. Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_, the Indemnifying Party will
have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or remedial
action with respect to any such Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will be entitled, at its own cost,
to participate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, unless separate representation of the Indemnified Party by
counsel is reasonably necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case
such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim but fails
to diligently prosecute such Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may assume control of such defense and in the event the Third Party
Claim is determined to be a matter for which the Indemnifying Party is
required to provide indemnification under the

 



      
 

 



 

terms of this _Article VII_, the Indemnifying Party will bear the reasonable
costs and expenses of such defense (including fees and expenses of counsel).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree or permit a default without the Indemnified PartyÂ’s prior written
consent, in each case, that (i) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of
a binding, irrevocable, written release of any Indemnified Party from all
Liability, (ii) provides for any admission of Liability on the part of any
Indemnified Party, (iii) requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the
part of any Indemnified Party or (iv) imposes any Liability or continuing
obligation on or requires any payment from any Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Calculation of Losses_. In calculating amounts payable to an
Indemnified Party, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be computed net
of (a) payments actually recovered by any Indemnified Party under any
insurance policy with respect to such Losses net of expenses and (b) any
actual recovery by any Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such
Losses net of expenses. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue reimbursement for Losses, including under
insurance policies and indemnity arrangements.

 



 

Section 7.6 _No Duplication_. In no event shall any Indemnified Party be
entitled to recover any Losses under one Section or provision of this
Agreement to the extent of the full amount of such Losses already recovered by
such Indemnified Party, nor shall its insurer or indemnitor be entitled to any
kind of subrogation or substitution which would give it the right to make a
claim against the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Contributor Parties and
Acquiror agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article
VII_ as an adjustment to the Consideration for all Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Release_.

 



 

(a) Except for the obligations of the Contributor Parties under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document, for and in consideration of the Subject
Interests, effective as of the Closing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including Acquiror GP), to absolutely and unconditionally release,
acquit and forever discharge the Contributor Parties and their Affiliates,
each of the present and former partners, members, equityholders, officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives of any of the
foregoing, and each of their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns, from any and all costs, expenses, damages, debts, or
any other obligations, liabilities and claims whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, both in law and in equity, in each case to the extent arising out of
or resulting from the ownership and/or operation of the Compression Group
Entities, or the assets, business, operations, conduct, services, products
and/or employees (including former employees) of the Compression Group
Entities (and any predecessors), related to any period of time before the
Closing Date, except to the extent of fraud or willful or wanton misconduct.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except for the obligations of Acquiror under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, for and in consideration of the Consideration, effective
as of the Closing, the Contributor Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, to absolutely and unconditionally release, acquit and
forever discharge Acquiror and its Affiliates (including the Compression Group
Entities), each of the present and former partners, members, equityholders,
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents and representatives of any of
the foregoing, and each of their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
successors and assigns, from any and all costs, expenses, damages, debts, or
any other obligations, liabilities and claims whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, both in law and in equity, in each case to the extent arising out of
or resulting from the ownership and/or operation of the Compression Group
Entities, or the assets, business, operations, conduct, services, products
and/or employees (including former employees) of the Compression Group
Entities (and any predecessors) prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or (ii) for the assertion of any claim based on fraud, the remedies
provided in this _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive legal remedies
of the Parties, from and after the Closing, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 7.9_ shall not prevent any Party from seeking and obtaining
injunctive relief against the other PartyÂ’s activities in breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.10 _No Reliance_. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE
IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE OR
DOCUMENT DELIVERED PURSUANT HERETO OR THERETO, EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT NO OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING ANY AFFILIATE OF
ANY PARTY, HAS MADE ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PARTIES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER MADE BY SUCH PARTIES OR ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES. EXCEPT
FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR IN ANY CERTIFICATE OR DOCUMENT DELIVERED
PURSUANT HERETO OR THERETO, EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NO
OTHER PARTY HAS MADE AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS RELIANCE ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT, OR INFORMATION
MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR
ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(INCLUDING OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION, OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR
MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY PARTY OR ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, AGENT,
CONSULTANT OR REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCH PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES) WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH PARTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be
available to the Contributor Parties, on the one hand, or Acquiror, on the
other hand, if such order was primarily due to the failure of the Contributor

their obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(c) by Acquiror if the Contributor Parties shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the
Contributor Parties shall have become untrue, in either case such that the

not have been cured by the date that is the earlier of (i) 30 days after ETPÂ’s
receipt of written notice of such breach from Acquiror and (ii) the Outside

September 30, 2018, upon the election of ETP, on behalf of the Contributor
Parties, or upon the election of Acquiror, in its sole discretion; _provided

covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by such Party prior
to the Closing; or

 



 

(f) by ETP, on behalf of the Contributor Parties, or Acquiror in the event

shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any
jurisdiction or in any other manner provided at law or in equity. EACH PARTY

Section 10.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns. No
Party may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that

obligations under this Agreement to (i) any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries
or (ii) for collateral security purposes, to the Financing Sources; _provided_
that no such assignment shall relieve Acquiror of its obligations hereunder.
Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be

Section 10.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the GP Purchase Agreement, the Restructuring Agreement or the
Preferred Purchase Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a
breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to Acquiror and the
Contributor Parties and Acquiror and the Contributor Parties would not have an
adequate remedy at Law. Therefore, the obligations of Acquiror and the
Contributor Parties under this Agreement, including ContributorÂ’s obligation
to contribute the Subject Interests to Acquiror and AcquirorÂ’s obligation to
acquire the Subject Interests from Contributor, shall be enforceable by a
decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,
and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not exclusive and
shall be in addition to any other remedies which any Party may have under this
Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits hereto), together with each of the other Transaction Documents,
constitute the entire understanding and agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all prior or
contemporaneous discussions, agreements and understandings, whether written or
oral.

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
applicable Law in any jurisdiction by any applicable Governmental Authority,

validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement
in such jurisdiction or affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any
provision in any other jurisdiction, (b) such provision shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable only to the extent strictly required by such
Governmental Authority, (c) to the extent any such provision is deemed to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, each of the Contributor Parties and
Acquiror agree that they shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
Governmental Authority to modify such provision so that such provision shall
be valid, legal and enforceable as originally intended to the greatest extent
possible and (d) to the extent that the Governmental Authority does not modify
such provision, each of the Contributor Parties and Acquiror agree that they
shall endeavor in good faith to exercise or modify such provision so that such
provision shall be valid, legal and enforceable as originally intended to the
greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information
(including dollar amounts) in any section of any schedule required by this
Agreement (the " ** _Disclosure Schedules_** ") shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by the disclosing party or any other Party that
such information is required to be listed on such section of the relevant
Disclosure Schedule (except to the extent required to be listed on such
section of the relevant Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Agreement) or is
material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the applicable
Person to which such disclosure relates. Each disclosure item set forth in the
Disclosure Schedules shall relate only to the specific Section of the
Agreement that corresponds to the number of such Schedule and to any other
Section of this Agreement to which it is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure relates. The information contained in
this Agreement, the Exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedules is

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party hereto to
any Third Party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of Law or
breach of contract).

upon and, except as provided below, inure solely to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. (i) None of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any
Person other than the Parties, including any creditor of any Party or any of
their Affiliates and (ii) no Person other than the Parties shall obtain any
right under any provision of this Agreement or shall by reason of any such
provision make any claim in respect of any Liability (or otherwise) against
any other Parties hereto, _provided_ that the Financing Sources shall be
express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely upon, ,
_Section 10.1_, _Section 10.2_, this _Section 10.10_ and _Section 10.12._

 



 

Section 10.11 _Facsimiles; Electronic Transmission; Counterparts_. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other electronic transmission
(including scanned documents delivered by email) by any Party and such
execution shall be deemed binding for all purposes hereof, without delivery of
an original signature being thereafter required. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which, when executed, shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same document.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Contributor Party
agrees that neither it, nor any of its former, current or future officers,
directors, managers, employees, members, partners, agents or other

participating in the Acquisition Financing or any of their respective former,
current or future direct or indirect equityholders, general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,

in part, out of comparative, contributory or sole negligence by any Finance

modification with respect to any related definitions as they affect this

Finance Related Party and (ii) each Finance Related Party shall be an express
third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to enforce, this _Section
10.12_.

 



 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto agrees that, _Section 9.1_ notwithstanding,
this provision shall be interpreted, and any action relating to this
provision, shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New York without
regard to the conflict of Laws provisions thereof that would cause the laws of
another state to apply.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere herein
(including _Section 9.1_), the Parties hereby further agree that no Party

for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and each
of the Parties hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and

Limited Partner is furnished the PartnershipÂ’s most recent annual report and
any subsequent quarterly or periodic reports required to be filed (or which
would be required to be filed) with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of
the Securities Exchange Act;

 



 

(ii) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence

(iii) to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited

(iv) to obtain such other information regarding the affairs of the Partnership
as the General Partner determines in its sole discretion is just and
reasonable.

 



 

(b) The General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for
such period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable, (i) any
information that the General Partner reasonably believes to be in the nature
of trade secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which the General
Partner believes (A) is not in the best interests of the Partnership Group,
(B) could damage the Partnership Group or its business or (C) that any Group
Member is required by law or by agreement with any third party to keep
confidential (other than agreements

 



      
 

 



 

with Affiliates of the Partnership the primary purpose of which is to
circumvent the obligations set forth in this _Section 3.4_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or Section 17-305 of
the Delaware Act, each of the Partners, each other Person who acquires an
interest in a Partnership Interest and each other Person bound by this
Agreement hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law that they do
not have rights to receive information from the Partnership or any Indemnitee
for the purpose of determining whether to pursue litigation or assist in
pending litigation against the Partnership or any Indemnitee relating to the
affairs of the Partnership except pursuant to the applicable rules of
discovery relating to litigation commenced by such Person.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV. 
CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 4.1 _Certificates_. Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary
herein, unless the General Partner shall determine otherwise in respect of
some or all of any or all classes of Partnership Interests, Partnership
Interests shall not be evidenced by certificates. Certificates that may be
issued shall be executed on behalf of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President,
Chief Financial Officer or any Vice President of the General Partner and the
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the General Partner or any other
authorized officer or director of the General Partner. If a Transfer Agent has
been appointed for a class of Partnership Interests, no Certificate for such
class of Partnership Interests shall be valid for any purpose until it has
been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
General Partner elects to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Interests
of such class in global form, the Certificate shall be valid upon receipt of a
certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the Partnership Interests
have been duly registered in accordance with the directions of the
Partnership. If Common Units are evidenced by Certificates, on or after the
date on which Class B Units are converted into Common Units, the Record
Holders of such Class B Units (i) if the Class B Units are evidenced by
Certificates, may exchange such Certificates for Certificates evidencing
Common Units or (ii) if the Class B Units are not evidenced by Certificates,
shall be issued Certificates evidencing Common Units.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates_.

 



 

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the
appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the General Partner
on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent shall
countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the
same number and type of Partnership Interests as the Certificate so
surrendered.

 



 

(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the General
Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the
Transfer Agent shall countersign, a new Certificate in place of any
Certificate previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

 



 

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed
or stolen;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the General Partner has
notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good
faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

 



 

(iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a
bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety
or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may direct
to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the
Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged
loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

 



 

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General
Partner.

 



 

If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable
period of time after such Limited Partner has notice of the loss, destruction
or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests
represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Limited
Partner shall be precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new
Certificate.

 



 

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this _Section
4.2_, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto
and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent)
reasonably connected therewith.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Record Holders_. The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize
the Record Holder as the Partner with respect to any Partnership Interest and,
accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to,
or interest in, such Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person,
regardless of whether the Partnership shall have actual or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Without
limiting the foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting
as nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person
in acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership
on the one hand, and such other Persons on the other, such representative
Person shall be (a) the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest and (b)
bound by this Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a Partner
hereunder as, and to the extent, provided herein.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Transfer Generally_.

 



 

(a) The term "transfer," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall mean a transaction (i) by which the General
Partner assigns its General Partner Interest to another Person, and includes a
sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange
or any other disposition by law or otherwise or (ii) by which the holder of a
Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited Partner Interest to another
Person who is or becomes a Limited Partner, and includes a sale, assignment,
gift, exchange or any other

 



      
 

 



 

disposition by law or otherwise, excluding a pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation or mortgage but including any transfer upon foreclosure of any
pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.

 



 

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this _Article IV_.
Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this _Article IV_ shall be, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, null and void.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
disposition by any stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the General
Partner or any Limited Partner of any or all of the shares of stock,
membership interests, partnership interests or other ownership interests in
the General Partner or Limited Partner and the term "transfer" shall not mean
any such disposition.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the
Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe and subject to the provisions of _Section 4.5(b)_, the
Partnership will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner
Interests.

 



 

(b) The Partnership shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner
Interests evidenced by Certificates until the Certificates evidencing such
Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of transfer. No
charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such transfer; _provided_ ,
that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this _Section
4.5_, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for registration of transfer of any Limited
Partner Interests evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the provisions
hereof, the appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and in the case of Certificates
evidencing Limited Partner Interests for which a Transfer Agent has been
appointed, the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of
the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant
to the holderÂ’s instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same
aggregate number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the
Certificate so surrendered.

 



 

(c) By acceptance of the transfer of any Limited Partner Interests in
accordance with this _Section 4.5_, each transferee of a Limited Partner
Interest (including any nominee holder or an agent or representative acquiring
such Limited Partner Interests for the account of another Person) (i) shall be
admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited
Partner Interests so transferred to such Person when any such transfer is
reflected in the books and records of the Partnership and such Limited Partner
becomes the Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interests so transferred,
(ii) shall become bound, and shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound, by
the terms of this Agreement, (iii) represents that the transferee has the
capacity, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and (iv) makes the
consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in this Agreement, all with
or without execution of this Agreement by such Person. The transfer of any
Limited Partner Interests and the admission of any new Limited Partner shall
not constitute an amendment to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.5_, (ii)
_Section 4.3_, (iii) _Section 4.7_, (iv) _Section 5.12_, (v) _Section
5.13_, (vi) _Section 6.4_, (vii) _Section 6.6_, (viii) with respect to any
class or series of Limited Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement
of designations or an amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or
series, (ix) any contractual provisions binding on any Limited Partner and (x)
provisions of applicable law including the Securities Act, Limited Partner
Interests shall be freely transferable.

 



 

(e) The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right at any time to
transfer their Common Units to one or more Persons.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Transfer of the General Partner Â’s General Partner Interest_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 4.6(c)_ below, prior to December 31, 2022, the
General Partner shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner
Interest to a Person unless such transfer (i) has been approved by the prior
written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the General Partner
and its Affiliates) or (ii) is of all, but not less than all, of its General
Partner Interest to (A) an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an
individual) or (B) another Person (other than an individual) in connection
with the merger or consolidation of the General Partner with or into such
other Person or the transfer by the General Partner of all or substantially
all of its assets to such other Person.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.6(c)_ below, on or after December 31, 2022, the
General Partner may at its option transfer all or any part of its General
Partner Interest without Unitholder approval.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees
to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the
partnership or membership interest held by the General Partner as the general
partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of
a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this _Section 4.6_, the
transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to compliance with
the terms of _Section 10.2_, be admitted to the Partnership as the General
Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner
Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue without
dissolution.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Restrictions on Transfers_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 4.7(c)_ below, but notwithstanding the
other provisions of this _Article IV_, no transfer of any Partnership
Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable
federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission,
any state securities commission or any other governmental authority with
jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification
of the Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or
(iii) cause the Partnership to be treated as an

 



       
 

 



 

association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed).

 



 

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if it determines, with the advice of counsel, that such restrictions
are necessary or advisable to (i) avoid a significant risk of the Partnership
becoming taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity
for federal income tax purposes or (ii) preserve the uniformity of the Limited
Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof, other than with respect to
Series A Preferred Units as contemplated by _Section 5.12(b)(vi)_ pursuant to
which all or some but less than all of the Series A Preferred Units may be
convertible into Common Units). The General Partner may impose such
restrictions by amending this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
amendment that would result in the delisting or suspension of trading of any
class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities
Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then listed or
admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected,
by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests of such class.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Article IV_, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading.

 



 

(d) In addition to any other restrictions on transfer set forth in this
Agreement, the transfer of a Series A Preferred Unit or a Series A Conversion
Unit shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_
and _Section 6.4_, respectively.

 



 

(e) In addition to any other restrictions on transfer set forth in this
Agreement, the transfer of a Class B Unit or a Class B Unit that has converted
into a Common Unit shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by _Section
5.13(e)_ and _Section 5.13(f)_, respectively.

 



 

(f) Each certificate evidencing Partnership Interests shall bear a conspicuous
legend in substantially the following form:

 



 

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF USA COMPRESSION
PARTNERS, LP THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE
EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF USA COMPRESSION PARTNERS, LP UNDER THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE USA COMPRESSION PARTNERS, LP TO BE TREATED
AS AN ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN
ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY SO TREATED
OR TAXED). USA COMPRESSION GP, LLC, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF USA COMPRESSION
PARTNERS, LP, MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS
SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES

 



      
 

 



 

AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF USA COMPRESSION PARTNERS, LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A
CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT
OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE
FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS
LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Citizenship Certificates; Non-citizen Assignees_.

 



 

(a) If any Group Member is or becomes subject to any federal, state or local
law or regulation that the General Partner determines would create a
substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property in which the
Group Member has an interest based on the nationality, citizenship or other
related status of a Limited Partner, the General Partner may request any
Limited Partner to furnish to the General Partner, within 30 days after
receipt of such request, an executed Citizenship Certification or such other
information concerning his nationality, citizenship or other related status
(or, if the Limited Partner is a nominee holding for the account of another
Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person)
as the General Partner may request. If a Limited Partner fails to furnish to
the General Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such Citizenship
Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of such
Citizenship Certification or other requested information the General Partner
determines that a Limited Partner is not an Eligible Citizen, the Limited
Partner Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be subject to redemption
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.9_. In addition, the General
Partner may require that the status of any such Limited Partner be changed to
that of a Non-citizen Assignee and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be
substituted for such Non-citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of
the Non-citizen AssigneeÂ’s Limited Partner Interests. As of the date hereof,
each of the Series A Purchasers is an Eligible Citizen.

 



 

(b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Partners (including
the General Partner) in respect of Limited Partner Interests other than those
of Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the
matter.

 



 

(c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to _Section 12.4_ but shall
be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen AssigneeÂ’s share of any
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen
Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive
his share of such distribution in kind).

 



 

(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible
Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner,
request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen
Assignee not redeemed pursuant to _Section 4.9_, such Non-citizen Assignee be
admitted as a Limited Partner, and upon approval of the General Partner, such
Non-citizen Assignee shall be admitted as a Limited Partner and shall no
longer

 



      
 

 



 

constitute a Non-citizen Assignee and the General Partner shall cease to be
deemed to be the Limited Partner in respect of the Non-citizen AssigneeÂ’s
Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Non-citizen Assignees_.

 



 

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner fails to furnish a Citizenship
Certification or other information requested within the 30-day period
specified in _Section 4.8(a)_, or if upon receipt of such Citizenship
Certification or other information the General Partner determines, with the
advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner is not an Eligible Citizen, the
Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of
the General Partner that such Limited Partner is an Eligible Citizen or has
transferred his Partnership Interests to a Person who is an Eligible Citizen
and who furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the General Partner prior to
the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Limited Partner
Interest of such Limited Partner as follows.

 



 

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner, at his
last address designated on the records of the Partnership or the Transfer
Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The notice shall be
deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall specify the
Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of payment,
that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of the
Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests and that on and after the date
fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the
Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable
Interests will accrue or be made.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption
price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by
delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of
the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 10% annually and payable
in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued
interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

 



 

(iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner, at the place
specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the
Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment
duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner or his duly authorized
representative shall be entitled to receive the payment therefor.

 



 

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Interests shall no longer
constitute issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 4.9_ shall also be applicable to Limited
Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner as nominee of a Person determined
to be other than an Eligible Citizen.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 4.9_ shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.
Upon receipt of notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw
the notice of redemption, _provided_ the transferee of such Limited Partner
Interest certifies to the satisfaction of the General Partner that he is an
Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make such certification, such
redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption
date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V. 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _General Partner and Limited Partner Interests; Conversion of
General Partner Interest and Cancellation of Incentive Distribution Rights_.

 



 

(a) On the date hereof, the General Partner is the sole general partner of the
Partnership and the owner of the General Partner Interest (as defined in the
2013 Agreement) and the Incentive Distribution Rights (as defined in the 2013
Agreement).

 



 

(b) Pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to the Equity Restructuring
Agreement, immediately following the Closing (as defined in the CDM
Contribution Agreement), the General Partner Interest (as defined in the 2013
Agreement) in the Partnership that existed immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement is hereby converted into a non-economic general partner
interest in the Partnership. Immediately following the Closing (as defined in
the CDM Contribution Agreement), the General Partner hereby continues as the
general partner of the Partnership and holds the General Partner Interest and
the Partnership is hereby continued without dissolution.

 



 

(c) Pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to the Equity Restructuring
Agreement, immediately following the Closing (as defined in the CDM
Contribution Agreement), all outstanding Incentive Distribution Rights (as
defined in the 2013 Agreement) are hereby cancelled.

 



 

(d) Pursuant to the Equity Restructuring Agreement and in consideration of the
transactions set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ and _Section 5.1(c)_, immediately
following the Closing (as defined in the CDM Contribution Agreement), the
Partnership shall issue [8,000,000] Common Units to the General Partner on the
date hereof, which issuance is hereby authorized, ratified and approved.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Contributions by the General Partner and USA Compression
Holdings_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, the General Partner and its Affiliates made Capital
Contributions in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ of the 2013 Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 12.8_, the General Partner shall not be
obligated to make any additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.3 _Contributions by Limited Partners_.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date and pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, each
Underwriter contributed cash to the Partnership in exchange for the issuance
by the Partnership of Common Units to each Underwriter, all as set forth in
the Underwriting Agreement.

 



 

(b) No Limited Partner will be required to make any additional Capital
Contribution to the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Interest and Withdrawal_. No interest shall be paid by the
Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if
any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon liquidation of
the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent
provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in
this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either
as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Capital Accounts_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of
Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has
furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with
Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General
Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect
to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Such Capital Account shall be increased
by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with
respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income
and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance
with _Section 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to _Section 6.1_, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net
Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property (other
than Series A PIK Units) made with respect to such Partnership Interest and
(y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with
_Section 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to _Section 6.1_. For the avoidance of doubt, each Series A
Preferred Unit will be treated as a partnership interest in the Partnership
that is "convertible equity" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.721-2(g)(3), and, therefore, each holder of a Series A Preferred Unit will
be treated as a partner in the Partnership. The initial Capital Account
balance in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit shall be the amount
determined pursuant to Section 2.07 of the Series A Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to _Article VI_ and is to be
reflected in the PartnersÂ’ Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination,
recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any
method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose),
_provided_ , that:

 



 

(i) Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.5_, the Partnership shall be
treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the
General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member
Agreement) of all property owned by (x)

 



      
 

 



 

any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company,
unincorporated business or other entity classified as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is, directly or
indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder.

 



 

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain,
loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section
754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items
described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard
to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the
extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset
pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss.

 



 

(iv) In the event the Carrying Value of Partnership property is adjusted
pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_, any Unrealized Gain resulting from such
adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain and any Unrealized Loss
resulting from such adjustment shall be treated as an item of loss.

 



 

(v) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
PartnershipÂ’s Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 



 

(vi) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to _Section
5.5(d)_ to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property
shall be determined under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-3(d)(2).

 



 

(vii) To the extent required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7, the Gross
Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at such times as
provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values. The amount of
any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss
(if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such

 



      
 

 



 

Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases
the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership).

 



 

(c) (i) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata
portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership
Interest so transferred.

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 5.13(e)_, immediately prior to the transfer of a
Class B Unit or a Common Unit that has been issued upon conversion of a Class
B Unit pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_ by a holder thereof (other than a
transfer to an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this
_Section 5.5(c)(ii)_ apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person
with respect to its Class B Units or Common Units issued upon conversion of
Class B Units will (A) first, be allocated to the Class B Units or Common
Units issued upon conversion of Class B Units to be transferred in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of such Class B Units or Common Units
issued upon conversion of Class B Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit
Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in
such Capital Account will be retained by the transferor as part of its Capital
Account with respect to its remaining interest in the Partnership. Following
any such transfer, the transfereeÂ’s Capital Account established with respect
to the transferred Class B Units or Common Units issued upon conversion of
Class B Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause
(A) hereinabove.

 



 

(d) (i) Consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s), on an issuance of additional
Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of a
Noncompensatory Option, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration
for the provision of services, the issuance of Partnership Interests pursuant
to the Equity Restructuring Agreement, the conversion of the General PartnerÂ’s
Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to _Section 11.3(b)_, the issuance
of Common Units upon the exercise of a 2018 Warrant or the conversion of
Series A Preferred Units to Common Units pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_, the
Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance
(or, in the case of the exercise of a 2018 Warrant, immediately after such
exercise date) or after such conversion (if in connection with the issuance of
a Noncompensatory Option) shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of the issuance of a Partnership
Interest pursuant to the exercise of a Noncompensatory Option (which, for
purposes hereof, shall include the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise
of a 2018 Warrant and any conversion of Series A Preferred Units to Common
Units pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_) where the right to share in Partnership
capital represented by such Partnership Interest differs from the
consideration paid to acquire and exercise such option, the Carrying Value of
each Partnership property immediately after the issuance of such Partnership
Interest shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property and the Capital
Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); _provided further, however,_
that in the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis
amount of cash or Contributed Property, in the event of an issuance of a
Noncompensatory Option to acquire a _de_ minimis Partnership Interest, or in
the event of an issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services, the General Partner may determine
that such adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the
Partnership. In determining such Unrealized Gain or

 



      
 

 



 

Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair market value of all Partnership property
(including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of
additional Partnership Interests (or, in the case of a Revaluation Event
resulting from the exercise of a Noncompensatory Option (which, for purposes
hereof, shall include the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise of a 2018
Warrant and any conversion of Series A Preferred Units to Common Units
pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_), immediately after the issuance of the
Partnership Interest acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Noncompensatory
Option) shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of
valuation as it may adopt; _provided_ , _however_ , that the General
Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair
market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time and
must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). If, after making the allocations
of Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth in _Section
6.1(d)(xiii)_, the Capital Account of each Partner with respect to each
Conversion Unit received upon such exercise of a 2018 Warrant or conversion of
the Limited Partner Interest is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a
then Outstanding Initial Common Unit, then, in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), Capital Account balances shall be
reallocated between the Partners holding Common Units (other than Conversion
Units) and Partners holding Conversion Units so as to cause the Capital
Account of each Partner holding a Conversion Unit to equal, on a per Unit
basis with respect to each such Conversion Unit, the Per Unit Capital Amount
for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit. In making its determination of the
fair market values of individual properties, the General Partner may determine
that it is appropriate to first determine an aggregate value for the
Partnership, based on the current trading price of the Common Units, and
taking fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests
of all Partners at such time, and then allocate such aggregate value among the
individual properties of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines
appropriate).

 



 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Carrying Value of all
Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution that is not made pursuant to _Section 12.4_ or in the case of a
deemed distribution, be determined in the same manner as that provided in
_Section 5.5(d)_ or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to
_Section 12.4_, be determined by the Liquidator using such method of
valuation as it may adopt.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.8_ and _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_, the Partnership may
issue additional Partnership Interests and options, rights, warrants,
appreciation rights and phantom or tracking interests relating to the
Partnership Interests (including as described in _Section 7.5(c)_) for any
Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such
consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall
determine, all without the approval of any Limited Partners.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each additional Partnership Interest authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ may be issued in one or more
classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Interests), as shall be fixed by the General
Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or
items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the
rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and
the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or shall be required
to redeem the Partnership Interest (including sinking fund provisions); (v)
whether such Partnership Interest is issued with the privilege of conversion
or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or
exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Interest
will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii)
the method for determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership
Interest; and (viii) the right, if any, of the holder of each such Partnership
Interest to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the
relative rights, preferences and privileges of such Partnership Interest.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership
Interests and options, rights, warrants, appreciation rights and phantom or
tracking interests relating to Partnership Interests pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ or _Section 7.5(c)_, (ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest into
Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) reflecting admission of
such additional Limited Partners in the books and records of the Partnership
as the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interest and (iv) all additional
issuances of Partnership Interests. The General Partner shall determine the
relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other
Partnership Interests being so issued. The General Partner shall do all things
necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do
all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection
with any future issuance of Partnership Interests or in connection with the
conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or
guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National
Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Interests are
listed or admitted to trading.

 



 

(d) No fractional Units (other than Series A PIK Units) shall be issued by the
Partnership.

 



 

Section 5.7 _[Reserved]_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Limited Preemptive Right_. Except as provided in this _Section
5.8_ or as otherwise provided in a separate agreement by the Partnership
(including under the terms of the 2018 Warrants), no Person shall have any
preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance
of any Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or
hereafter created. Except for (i) Common Units to be issued upon conversion of
Class B Units, (ii) Common Units to be issued upon conversion of Series A
Preferred Units and (iii) Common Units to be issued upon exercise of 2018
Warrants, in each case pursuant to this Agreement, the General Partner shall
have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to
any of its Affiliates or the beneficial owners thereof or any of their
respective Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Interests from the Partnership
whenever, and on the same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership
Interests to Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

or such beneficial owners or any of their respective Affiliates, to the extent
necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its
Affiliates and such beneficial owners or any of their respective Affiliates
equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such
Partnership Interests.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Splits and Combinations_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.9(d)_ and _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(E)_, the
Partnership may make a Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all
Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership
Interests so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the same
Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts
calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units are
proportionately adjusted retroactive to the beginning of the PartnershipÂ’s
term. Upon any Pro Rata distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record
Holders of Common Units or any subdivision or combination (or reclassified
into a greater or smaller number) of Common Units, the Partnership will
proportionately adjust the number of Class B Units as follows: (a) if the
Partnership issues Partnership Interests as a distribution on its Common Units
or subdivides the Common Units (or reclassifies them into a greater number of
Common Units) then the Class B Units shall be subdivided into a number of
Class B Units equal to the result of multiplying the number of Class B Units
by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of
Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such distribution, subdivision
or reclassification plus the total number of Partnership Interests issued in
such distribution; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of
Common Units outstanding immediately prior to such distribution, subdivision
or reclassification; and (b) if the Partnership combines the Common Units (or
reclassifies them into a smaller number of Common Units) then the Class B
Units shall be combined into a number of Class B Units equal to the result of
multiplying the number of Class B Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator of
which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units outstanding immediately
following such combination or reclassification; and (B) the denominator of
which shall be the number of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to
such combination or reclassification.

 



 

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Interests is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public
accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Interests to
be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution,
subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on
any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy
of such calculation.

 



 

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership
Interests as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of
Partnership Interests held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may
adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate
to reflect such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total
number of Partnership Interests Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as
a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution,
subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or
combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for
the provisions of this _Section 5.9(d)_, each fractional Unit shall be
rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next
higher Unit).

 



 

Section 5.10 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests_. All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in
accordance with the requirements of, this _Article V_ shall be fully paid and
non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such
non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 or 17-804 of the Delaware
Act.

 



 

Section 5.11 _[Reserved]_.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Establishment of Series A Preferred Units_.

 



 

(a) _General._ There is hereby created a class of Units designated as "Series
A Perpetual Preferred Units" (such Series A Perpetual Preferred Units,
together with any Series A PIK Units, the " ** _Series A Preferred
Units_**"), with the designations, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights, powers and duties as set forth in this
_Section 5.12_ and elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Rights of Series A Preferred Units_. The Series A Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and the Series A
Preferred Unitholders shall be subject to the following duties and
obligations:

 



 

(i) _Distributions._

 



 

(A) Subject to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(B)_, commencing with the Quarter ending on
[March 31], 2018, subject to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_, the Record Holders of
the Series A Preferred Units as of the applicable Record Date for each Quarter
shall be entitled to receive, in respect of each outstanding Series A
Preferred Unit, cumulative distributions in respect of such Quarter equal to
the sum of (1) the Series A Distribution Amount for such Quarter and (2) any
Series A Unpaid Distributions (collectively, a " ** _Series A Quarterly
Distribution_**"). Provided that no Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing, with respect to any Quarter (or portion thereof for which a Series
A Quarterly Distribution is due) ending on or prior to [March 31, 2019](7)
(the " ** _Series A Initial Distribution Period_**"), such Series A Quarterly
Distribution shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or
in a combination of Series A PIK Units and cash; _provided_ , that the portion
paid in Series A PIK Units may not exceed 48.72% of the Series A Distribution
Amount for such Quarter and the remainder of such Series A Quarterly
Distribution Amount shall be paid in cash. For any Quarter ending after the
Series A Initial Distribution Period, all Series A Quarterly Distributions
shall be paid in cash. If, during the Series A Initial Distribution Period,
the General Partner elects to pay a portion of a Series A Quarterly
Distribution in Series A PIK Units, the number of Series A PIK Units to be
issued in connection with such Series A Quarterly Distribution shall equal the
quotient of (A) the portion of such Series A Quarterly Distribution to be

  (7) Note to Draft: To be quarter in which closing occurs plus 4 full quarters
thereafter.

 



      
 

 



 

paid in Series A PIK Units, divided by (B) the Series A Issue Price;
_provided_ , that with respect to each Series A Quarterly Distribution to be
paid in part in Series A PIK Units, the Series A PIK Units will be allocated
pro rata among the Series A Preferred Unitholders. Each Series A Quarterly
Distribution shall be due and payable quarterly by no later than 60 days after
the end of the applicable Quarter (each such payment date, a " ** _Series A
Distribution Payment Date_**"). If the General Partner establishes an earlier
Record Date for any distribution to be made by the Partnership on other
Partnership Interests in respect of any Quarter, then the Record Date
established pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(i)_ for a Series A Quarterly
Distribution in respect of such Quarter shall be the same Record Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_, the Series A
Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions made pursuant to
_Section 6.3_. All Series A Quarterly Distributions payable by the
Partnership pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)_ shall be payable without
regard to income of the Partnership and shall be treated for federal income
tax purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital under Section
707(c) of the Code.

 

 

(B) If the Partnership fails to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount
of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)(i)(A)_ when due for any Quarter (a " ** _Payment Default_** "), then
(1) the amount of such unpaid Series A Distribution Amount (on a per Series A
Preferred Unit basis, including any distributions accrued and unpaid at the
Deficiency Rate, " ** _Series A Unpaid Distributions_**") will accrue and
accumulate at the Deficiency Rate from and including the first day of the
Quarter immediately following the Quarter in respect of which such payment was
due (the " ** _Default Effective Date_** "), until paid in full in cash (or
until the earlier conversion or redemption of the underlying Series A
Preferred Units); (2) commencing on the Default Effective Date the Series A
Distribution Amount shall be $25.625 [; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (a)
on or prior to the one year anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date, the
Partnership issues the 2018 Senior Unsecured Notes and uses all or a portion
of the proceeds received with respect thereto to repay the Bridge Loan and the
all-in-yield associated with the 2018 Senior Unsecured Notes exceeds 7.5%, or
(b) any amounts are outstanding under the Bridge Loan as of the one year
anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date and the all-in-yield associated with
such outstanding amounts exceeds 7.5%, then, in either case, the amount of the
Series A Distribution Amount shall be increased by $0.025 for every basis
point by which the weighted average all-in-yield exceeds 7.5%, but in no event
shall the Series A Distribution Amount exceed $28.125](8) (such amount, as
applicable, the " ** _Deficiency Rate_** "), until such time as all Series A
Unpaid Distributions are paid in full in cash; and (3) from and after the
Default Effective Date and continuing until such time as all Series A Unpaid
Distributions are paid in full in cash, the Partnership shall not be permitted
to, and shall not, declare or make, any distributions, redemptions or
repurchases in respect of any Series A Junior Securities or Series A Parity
Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Quarter
for which the Partnership first failed to pay in full the Series

  (8) Note to Draft: To be included if the senior unsecured notes are not
issued at or prior to closing.

 



      
 

 



 

A Distribution Amount of any Series A Quarterly Distribution when due);
_provided, however_ , that distributions may be declared and paid on the
Series A Preferred Units and the Series A Parity Securities so long as such
distributions are declared and paid pro rata so that amounts of distributions
declared per Series A Preferred Unit and Series A Parity Security shall in all
cases bear to each other the same ratio that accrued and accumulated
distributions per Series A Preferred Unit and Series A Parity Security bear to
each other.

 



 

(C) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12(b)(i)_ to the contrary,
with respect to any Series A Preferred Unit that is converted into a Common
Unit, (i) with respect to a distribution to be made to Record Holders as of a
Record Date preceding such conversion, the Record Holder as of such Record
Date of such Series A Preferred Unit shall be entitled to receive such
distribution in respect of such Series A Preferred Unit on the corresponding
Series A Distribution Payment Date, but shall not be entitled to receive such
distribution in respect of the Common Units into which such Series A Preferred
Unit was converted on the payment date thereof, and (ii) with respect to a
distribution to be made to Record Holders as of any Record Date on or
following the date of such conversion, the Record Holder as of such Record
Date of the Common Units into which such Series A Preferred Unit was converted
shall be entitled to receive such distribution in respect of such converted
Common Units on the payment date thereof, but shall not be entitled to receive
such distribution in respect of such Series A Preferred Unit on the
corresponding Series A Distribution Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
if a Series A Preferred Unit is converted into Common Units pursuant to the
terms hereof following a Record Date but prior to the corresponding Series A
Distribution Payment Date, then the Record Holder of such Series A Preferred
Unit as of such Record Date shall nonetheless remain entitled to receive on
the Series A Distribution Payment Date a distribution in respect of such
Series A Preferred Unit pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(i)(A)_ and, until such
distribution is received, _Section 5.12(b)(i)(B)_ shall continue to apply.

 



 

(D) When any Series A PIK Units are payable to a Series A Preferred Unitholder
pursuant to this _Section 5.12_, the Partnership shall issue the Series A PIK
Units to such holder in accordance with _Section 5.12(b)(i)(A)_ (the date of
issuance of such Series A PIK Units, the " ** _Series A PIK Payment
Date_**"). On the Series A PIK Payment Date, the Partnership shall have the
option to (i) issue to such Series A Preferred Unitholder a certificate or
certificates for the number of Series A PIK Units to which such Series A
Preferred Unitholder shall be entitled, or (ii) cause the Transfer Agent to
make a notation in book entry form in the books of the Partnership, and all
such Series A PIK Units shall, when so issued, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests, except as
such non-assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 or 17-804 of
the Delaware Act, and shall be free from preemptive rights and free of any
lien, claim, rights or encumbrances, other than those arising under the
Delaware Act or this Agreement.

 



 



      
 

 



 

(E) For purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, if the Partnership issues
one or more Series A PIK Units with respect to a Series A Preferred Unit, (i)
the Partnership shall be treated as distributing cash with respect to such
Series A Preferred Unit in an amount equal to the Series A Issue Price of the
Series A PIK Unit issued in payment of the Series A Quarterly Distribution,
which deemed payment shall be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
guaranteed payment for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the Code,
and (ii) the holder of such Series A Preferred Unit shall be treated as having
contributed to the Partnership in exchange for such newly issued Series A PIK
Unit an amount of cash equal to the Series A Issue Price.

 



 

(F) On or prior to each Series A Distribution Payment Date, the General
Partner shall determine whether the Leverage Ratio determined as of the last
day of the preceding Quarter exceeded 6.5x and if the General Partner
determines that the Leverage Ratio did exceed 6.5x as of such date, the
General Partner shall, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, deliver a
written notice to each Series A Preferred Unitholder stating the General
PartnerÂ’s determination of the Leverage Ratio as of such date.

 



 

(ii) _Issuance of the Series A Preferred Units_. The Series A Preferred Units
(other than the Series A PIK Units) shall be issued by the Partnership on the
date hereof pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Series A Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

(iii) _Voting Rights_.

 



 

(A) Except as provided in this _Section 5.12_, the Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units shall have no voting, consent or approval rights.

 



 

(B) Except as provided in _Section 5.12(b)(iii)(C)_, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all other requirements
imposed by Delaware law, and all other voting rights granted under this
Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required
Voting Percentage shall be required for any amendment to this Agreement or the
Certificate of Limited Partnership (in either case, including by merger or
otherwise) that is materially adverse to any of the rights, preferences and
privileges of the Series A Preferred Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
General Partner may, in its sole discretion and without any vote of the
holders of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units (but without prejudice to
their rights under this _Section 5.12(b)(iii)_), amend this Agreement to
change the distribution provisions of the Series A Preferred Units solely to
provide for monthly distribution payments by the Partnership to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, any amendment shall be deemed to have such a materially adverse
impact if such amendment would:

 



 

(1) reduce the Series A Distribution Amount or the Deficiency Rate, change the
form of payment of distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, defer the
date from which distributions on the Series A Preferred Units will accrue,
cancel any

 



      
 

 



 

Series A Unpaid Distributions or any interest accrued thereon (including any
Series A Unpaid Distributions, Series A Partial Period Distributions or Series
A PIK Units), or change the seniority rights of the Series A Preferred
Unitholders as to the payment of distributions in relation to the holders of
any other class or series of Partnership Interests;

 



 

(2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the Record
Holders of the Series A Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation
preferences of the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units in relation
to the rights upon liquidation of the holders of any other class or series of
Partnership Interests; or

 



 

(3) make the Series A Preferred Units redeemable or convertible at the option
of the Partnership other than as set forth herein.

 



 

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.12(b)(iii)_,
in no event shall the consent of the Series A Preferred Unitholders, as a
separate class, be required in connection with any Series A Change of Control
to the extent in compliance with _Section 5.12(b)(vii)_ or Partnership
Restructuring Event.

 



 

(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to all
other voting rights granted under this Agreement, the Partnership shall not
declare or pay any distribution from Capital Surplus (other than on account of
the Series A Distribution Amount) without the affirmative vote of the Record
Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage.

 



 

(E) The Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the Record
Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage, incur (or permit any of
its Subsidiaries to incur) Indebtedness if, after giving pro forma effect to
such incurrence, the Leverage Ratio determined as of the last day of the most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been
prepared, would exceed 6.5x; except: (a) Indebtedness the net cash proceeds of
which are promptly used to redeem in full in cash all issued and outstanding
Series A Preferred Units; (b) Indebtedness constituting Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness; (c) surety and performance bonds in the ordinary course of
business of the Partnership; (d) Indebtedness among the Partnership and its
wholly owned Subsidiaries; (e) other Indebtedness the net cash proceeds of
which are less than $10 million in any fiscal year; and (f) Indebtedness
incurred pursuant to a customary asset based loan or a revolving based loan (a
majority of the lenders of which are commercial banks) to finance (1) capital
expenditures for growth projects to the extent such expenditures are being
incurred in compliance with a capital budget approved by the Board of
Directors that was, at the time of adoption, determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith not to result in borrowings that would cause the
Leverage Ratio to be in excess of 6.5x at any time during the time period
contemplated by such budget or (2) other working capital items incurred in the
ordinary course of business; but, with respect to this clause (f)(2), only (i)
prior to the date that is six months from the date of incurrence of any
Indebtedness that causes the Leverage Ratio to be in

 



      
 

 



 

excess of 6.5x and (ii) so long as the Partnership is using commercially
reasonable efforts during such period to reduce the Leverage Ratio to 6.5x or
less.

 



 

(F) The Partnership shall not enter into (1) a merger or other similar
transaction (other than a Series A Change of Control) if the Series A
Preferred Units will cease to be outstanding and are exchanged for other
consideration in such merger or other similar transaction, and such
consideration is less than the amount the Series A Preferred Units would
otherwise receive if the merger or similar transaction were a Series A Change
of Control or (2) a Series A Change of Control except in compliance with
_Section 5.12(b)(vii)_, including, with respect to each Series A Preferred
Unitholder that elects to be treated in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)(vi)(A)(2)_, payment of the cash amount to be paid to such Series A
Preferred Unitholder pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(A)(2)_ as and when
provided by such Section.

 



 

(G) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without the affirmative vote of
the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage, (1) make a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (2) file a voluntary
bankruptcy petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code; (3) file a petition or answer seeking for itself a liquidation,
dissolution or similar relief (but not a reorganization) under any law; (4)
file an answer or other pleading admitting or failing to contest the material
allegations of a petition filed against it in a proceeding of the type
described in clauses (1)-(3) of this _Section 5.12(b)(iii)(G)_; or (5) seek,
consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of a trustee (but not a debtor-in-
possession), receiver or liquidator of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or of all or any substantial part of their properties.

 



 

(H) If a Payment Default occurs and is continuing on the first day of the
third quarter following the applicable Default Effective Date (e.g. if a
Default Effective Date occurred on January 1, October 1) (an " ** _Ongoing
Default Trigger_** "), then from and after such date unless and until such
time as all Series A Unpaid Distributions are paid in full in cash, the
Partnership shall not and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, without
the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting
Percentage: (1) incur any additional Indebtedness in excess of $25.0 million
(except Indebtedness incurred in the ordinary course of business of the
Partnership consistent with past practice, including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Agreement or any other revolving credit agreement of the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries, pursuant to surety and performance bonds,
purchase money or capital lease obligations, contingent purchase prices or
notes issued on acquisitions approved by the Board of Directors, general
accounts receivable and trade credit indebtedness, liens securing any of the
foregoing and guarantees relating to any of the foregoing); (2) acquire any
assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions with a
purchase price greater than $10 million or in the aggregate during any quarter
with aggregate purchase prices in excess of $25.0 million; or (3) sell any
assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions with a
purchase price greater than $10 million or in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate during any quarter with aggregate purchase prices in excess of $25.0
million.

 



 

(iv) _No Series A Senior Securities; Series A Parity Securities._ Other than
issuances of Series A PIK Units, the Partnership shall not, without the
affirmative vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting
Percentage, issue any (A) Series A Senior Securities (or amend the provisions
of this Agreement to create any class of Series A Senior Securities, or to
convert or reclassify any existing class of Partnership Interests into a class
of Series A Senior Securities) or (B) Series A Parity Securities (or amend the
provisions of this Agreement to create any class of Series A Parity
Securities, or to convert or reclassify any existing class of Partnership
Interests into a class of Series A Parity Securities) or Series A Preferred
Units. Subject to _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(E)_, the Partnership may, without any
vote of the holders of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, issue the Series
A PIK Units contemplated by this Agreement or create (by reclassification or
otherwise) and issue Series A Junior Securities in an unlimited amount.

 



 

(v) _Legends._ Each book entry evidencing a Series A Preferred Unit shall bear
a restrictive notation in substantially the form set forth in _Exhibit B_.

 



 

(vi) _Conversion_.

 



 

(A) The Series A Preferred Units will become convertible, at the option of the
Series A Preferred Unitholders, into Common Units as follows:

 



 

(1) from and after [*], 2021, 33 1/3% of the Series A Preferred Units issued
on the Series A Issuance Date, plus all of the Series A PIK Units issued as
Series A Quarterly Distributions on such Series A Preferred Units, shall be
convertible;

 



 

(2) from and after [*], 2022, 66 2/3% of the Series A Preferred Units issued
on the Series A Issuance Date, plus all of the Series A PIK Units issued as
Series A Quarterly Distributions on such Series A Preferred Units, shall be
convertible; and

 



 

(3) from and after [*], 2023, all of the Series A Preferred Units shall be
convertible; _provided_ , _that,_

 



 

(4) notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Ongoing Default Trigger occurs at any
time, from and after the occurrence of such Ongoing Default Trigger, all of
the issued and Outstanding Series A Preferred Units shall be convertible;

 



 

in each case, at any time, and from time to time, in whole or in part, subject
to this _Section 5.12(b)(vi)_. The conversion rights in the preceding
sentence shall be allocated proportionally among the Record Holders of the
Series A Preferred Units at the time the Series A Preferred Units become
convertible. Any transfer of Series A Preferred Units after [*], 2021 shall be
deemed to include proportional amounts of convertible and non-convertible
Series A Preferred Units, unless otherwise agreed upon by the transferring
Series A Preferred Unitholder and their respective transferees; _provided_ ,
that the transferring Series A Preferred Unitholder shall notify the
Partnership in writing of any non-proportional transfer, including the amount
of convertible and non-convertible Series A Preferred Units transferred and
the name(s) of the transferees.

 



      
 

 



 

 _(B)_ _Conversion Notice._ A Series A Preferred Unitholder may exercise its
right to convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to
_Section 5.12(b)(vi)(A)_ by delivering written notice (a " ** _Series A
Conversion Notice_**," and the date such notice is received, a " ** _Series A
Conversion Notice Date_**") to the Partnership stating that such Series A
Preferred Unitholder elects to so convert Series A Preferred Units held by
such Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(A)_, the
number of Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder
to be converted and the Person to whom such Common Units should be issued;
_provided_ that a Series A Preferred Unitholder may not deliver more than one
Series A Conversion Notice per Quarter.

 



 

(C) _Timing; Conversion._ If a Series A Conversion Notice is delivered by a
Series A Preferred Unitholder to the Partnership in accordance with _Section
5.12(b)(vi)(B)_, then, no later than five Business Days after the Series A
Conversion Notice Date, the Partnership shall (1) issue to the applicable
Series A Preferred Unitholder (or its designated recipient(s)) a number of
Series A Conversion Units equal to (x) the number of Series A Preferred Units
designated to be converted in such Series A Conversion Notice, multiplied by
(y) the Series A Conversion Rate as of such date and (2) instruct, and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, its Transfer Agent to electronically
transmit the Series A Conversion Units issuable upon conversion to such Series
A Preferred Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)), by crediting the account
of the Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)) through its
Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties agree to coordinate
with the Transfer Agent to accomplish this objective.

 



 

(D) If a Series A Preferred Unit is converted pursuant to _Section
5.12(b)(vi)(C)_ (a " ** _Converted Series A Preferred Unit_**"), immediately
upon the issuance of Series A Conversion Units pursuant to _Section
5.12(b)(vi)(C)_ with respect to the conversion of such Converted Series A
Preferred Unit, the applicable Series A Preferred Unitholder (or its
designated recipient(s)) shall be treated for all purposes as the owner of
such Series A Conversion Units, and all rights of the applicable Series A
Preferred Unitholder with respect to such Converted Series A Preferred Unit
shall cease, including any further accrual of distributions, but subject to
_Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(vi)_ (each fractional Common Unit
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Common Unit with the remainder
being paid as an amount in cash to be calculated based on the Closing Price of
Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion
Notice Date).

 



 

(E) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If, after the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership (i) makes
a distribution on its Common Units payable in Common Units or other
Partnership Interests, (ii) subdivides or splits its Outstanding Common Units
into a greater number of Common Units, (iii) combines or reclassifies its
Common Units into a lesser number of Common Units, (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any
reclassification in connection with a

 



      
 

 



 

merger, consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the
surviving Person), (v) effects a Pro Rata repurchase of Common Units, other
than in connection with a Series A Change of Control (which shall be governed
by _Section 5.12(b)(vii)_), (vi) issues to holders of Common Units, in their
capacity as holders of Common Units, rights, options or warrants entitling
them to subscribe for or purchase Common Units at less than the market value
thereof, (vii) distributes to holders of Common Units evidences of
indebtedness, Partnership Interests (other than Common Units) or other assets
(including securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in clause
(i), any rights or warrants referred to in clause (vi), any consideration
payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries and any distribution of Units or any class or
series, or similar Partnership Interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or
other business unit in the case of certain spin-off transactions described
below), or (viii) consummates a spin-off, where the Partnership makes a
distribution to all holders of Common Units consisting of Units of any class
or series, or similar equity interests of, or relating to, a Subsidiary or
other business unit, then the Series A Conversion Rate in effect at the time
of the Record Date for such distribution or the effective date of any such
other transaction shall be proportionately adjusted: (1) in respect of clauses
(i) through (iv) above, so that the conversion of the Series A Preferred Units
after such time shall entitle each Series A Preferred Unitholder to receive
the aggregate number of Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which
such Common Units would have been combined, consolidated, merged or
reclassified, as applicable) that such Series A Preferred Unitholder would
have been entitled to receive if the Series A Preferred Units had been
converted into Common Units immediately prior to such Record Date or effective
date, as the case may be, (2) in respect of clauses (v) through (viii) above,
in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner to appropriately ensure
that the Series A Preferred Units are convertible into an economically
equivalent number of Common Units after taking into account the event
described in clauses (v) through (viii) above, and (3) in addition to the
foregoing, in the case of a merger, consolidation or business combination in
which the Partnership is the surviving Person, the Partnership shall provide
effective provisions to ensure that the provisions in this _Section 5.12_
relating to the Series A Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and
that the Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers,
economic rights, preferences and relative participating, optional and other
special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon,
that the Series A Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or
event, and the Series A Conversion Rate and any other terms of the Series A
Preferred Units that the General Partner in its reasonable discretion
determines require adjustment to achieve the economic equivalence described
below, shall be proportionately adjusted to take into account any such
subdivision, split, combination or reclassification. An adjustment made
pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(E)_ shall become effective immediately
after the Record Date in the case of a distribution and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination, reclassification (including any reclassification in connection
with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership is the surviving Person) or split. Such adjustment shall be made
successively whenever any event described above shall occur.

 



 

(F) _No Adjustments for Certain Items._ Notwithstanding any of the other
provisions of this _Section 5.12(b)(vi)_, no adjustment shall be made to the
Series A Conversion Rate pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(E)_ as a result of
any of the following:

 



 

(1) any cash distributions made to holders of the Common Units (unless made in
breach of _Section 5.12(b)(i)(B)_);

 



 

(2) any issuance of Partnership Interests in exchange for cash, including
pursuant to any distribution reinvestment plan;

 



 

(3) any grant of Common Units or options, warrants, rights or other equity
interests to purchase or receive Common Units or the issuance of Common Units
upon the exercise or vesting of any such options, warrants, rights or other
equity interests in respect of services provided to or for the benefit of the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries, under compensation plans and agreements
approved by the General Partner (including any long-term incentive plan);

 



 

(4) any issuance of Common Units as all or part of the consideration to effect
(i) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity
interests of a third party in an armÂ’s-length transaction, (ii) the closing of
any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity interests of ETE, ETP
or any of their respective Affiliates, (iii) the consummation of a merger,
consolidation or other business combination of the Partnership with another
entity in which the Partnership survives and the Common Units remain
Outstanding, or (iv) the direct or indirect acquisition of all or a portion of
the limited liability company interests in the General Partner by the
Partnership or a Subsidiary of the Partnership, to the extent any such
transaction set forth in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ above is
validly approved by the General Partner;

 



 

(5) the issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Units or Series A Parity Securities;

 



 

(6) the issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Class B Units; or

 



 

(7) the issuance of Common Units upon exercise of the 2018 Warrants.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever the
issuance of a Partnership Interest or other event would require an adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Rate under one or more provisions of this
Agreement, only one adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate
in respect of such issuance or event.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.12(b)(vi)(E)_, unless
otherwise determined by the General Partner, no adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to any distribution or other
transaction described in _Section 5.12(b)(v)(E)_ if the Series A Preferred

 



       
 

 



 

Unitholders are entitled to participate in such distribution or transaction as
if they held a number of Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Units immediately prior to such event at the then applicable Series
A Conversion Rate, without having to convert their Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(vii) _Series A Change of Control._

 



 

(A) Within 5 Business Days following execution of definitive agreements
relating to a Series A Change of Control, and at least 15 Business Days prior
to consummating such Series A Change of Control, the Partnership shall deliver
written notice (a " ** _Series A Change of Control Notice_**") of such Series
A Change of Control (including a summary of all material terms and copies of
the definitive agreements relating thereto) to each Series A Preferred
Unitholder. Within 10 Business Days following delivery of a Series A Change of
Control Notice, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall deliver a written
notice to the Partnership electing one of sub-clauses (1), (2) or (3) below;
_provided_ , that if a Series A Preferred Unitholder fails to timely deliver
written notice of such election to the Partnership, such Series A Preferred
Unitholder shall be deemed to have elected the option set forth in sub-clause
(1) below. Each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be entitled to elect
(subject to the proviso of the preceding sentence, and, in each case, subject
to the consummation of the applicable Series A Change of Control) to:

 



 

(1) effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Series A Change of
Control, convert all, but not less than all, of the Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder into Common Units,
at the then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate;

 



 

(2) require the Partnership to redeem all of the Series A Preferred Units held
by such Series A Preferred Unitholder as of the consummation of such Series A
Change of Control for an amount in cash, per Series A Preferred Unit, equal to
the sum of (A) the Series A Redemption Price per Series A Preferred Unit
(excluding, for this purpose, any Series A Partial Period Distributions), plus
(B) (x) the Series A Distribution Amount multiplied by (y) the number of
Quarters ending after the consummation of such Series A Change of Control and
prior to (but including) [*], 2022(9), plus (C) $[*](10). If any Series A
Preferred Unitholders elect this sub-clause (2) with respect to the Series A
Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholders, then no later
than three Trading Days prior to the consummation of the applicable Series A
Change of Control, the Partnership shall deliver a written notice to the
Record Holders of such Series A Preferred Units stating the date on which the
Series A Preferred Units will be redeemed and the PartnershipÂ’s computation of
the amount of cash to be received by the Record Holder upon redemption of such
Series A Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall be the surviving entity of
the related Series A Change of Control, then no later than 10 Business Days
following the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, the Partnership
shall remit the applicable

  (9) Note to Draft: To be the fourth anniversary of the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(10) Note to Draft: To be the pro-rated Series A Distribution Amount for the
quarter during which the fourth anniversary of the date of this Agreement will
occur.

 



      
 

 



 

cash consideration to the Record Holders of then Outstanding Series A
Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall not be the surviving entity of the
related Series A Change of Control, then the Partnership shall remit the
applicable cash immediately prior to the consummation of the related Series A
Change of Control. The Record Holders shall deliver to the Partnership any
Certificates representing the Series A Preferred Units as soon as practicable
following the redemption. Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall
retain all of the rights and privileges thereof unless and until the
consideration due to them as a result of such redemption shall be paid in full
in cash. After any such redemption, any such redeemed Series A Preferred Unit
shall no longer constitute an issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interest.
[Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)(2)_ to the
contrary, if a redemption pursuant to this Section would cause the Series A
Preferred Units to be characterized as "disqualified stock," "disqualified
capital stock" or any similar concept pursuant to the terms of any agreement,
document or instrument governing or evidencing any Indebtedness of the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries that is, or was originally issued or incurred,
in excess of $[10,000,000], the redemption obligation of the Partnership set
forth in this _Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)(2)_ shall be tolled until the earlier
of the date (i) such redemption would comply with a "Restricted Payments"
covenant or similar covenant contained in any such agreement, document or
instrument, or (ii) the applicable loans and other debt obligations under such
agreement, document or instrument are, to the extent required, repaid (and, if
applicable, any commitments will be terminated and any obligations to offer to
redeem, repay or repurchase such loans or other debt obligations as a result
of the Series A Change of Control will have expired) prior to such redemption
of the Series A Preferred Units and the Partnership will timely comply with
any "change of control offer" or similar requirements under the terms of any
such agreement, document or instrument, if applicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, the preceding proviso shall not be deemed to be a waiver by any Series
A Preferred Unitholder of its right to receive from the Partnership and/or its
successor the cash payment required by this _Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)(2)_ in
connection with such Series A Change of Control and redemption)](11); or

 



 

(3) if the Partnership will not be the surviving entity of such Series A
Change of Control or the Partnership will be the surviving entity but its
Common Units will cease to be listed or admitted to trading on a National
Securities Exchange, require the Partnership to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or to cause to be delivered to such Series A
Preferred Unitholder, in exchange for its Series A Preferred Units
concurrently with the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, a
security in the surviving entity or the parent of the surviving entity that
has substantially similar rights, preferences and privileges as the Series A
Preferred Units, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the right to
distributions equal in amount and timing to those provided in _Section
5.12(b)(i)_ and a conversion rate proportionately adjusted such that the
conversion of such security in the surviving entity or parent of the surviving
entity immediately following the Series A Change of Control would entitle the
Record Holder to the number of common securities of such entity (together with
a number of common securities of equivalent value to any other assets received
by holders of Common Units in such Series A Change of Control) which, if a
Series A Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units immediately prior
to such Series A Change of Control, such Record Holder would have been
entitled to receive immediately following such Series A Change of Control
(such security in the surviving entity, a " ** _Series A Substantially
Equivalent Unit_**"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Partnership is
unable to deliver or cause to be delivered Series A Substantially Equivalent
Units to

  (11) Note to Draft: Subject to review of the terms of the senior notes.

 



      
 

 



 

any Series A Preferred Unitholder in connection with such Series A Change of
Control, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be entitled to require
conversion or redemption of its Series A Preferred Units in the manner
contemplated by sub-clause (1) or (2) of this _Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)_ (at
such Series A Preferred UnitholderÂ’s election);

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that, in connection with a merger of the Partnership
with another entity pursuant to which ETE, ETP or one of their respective
Affiliates owns more than 50% of the voting interests of such entity (or, if
such entity is a partnership, the general partner of such entity), then each
Series A Preferred Unitholder may only select between the options specified in
_Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)(1)_ or _Section 5.12(b)(vii)(A)(2)_.

 



 

(viii) _Series A Preferred Unit Transfer Restrictions_.

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_
(other than the restriction on transfers to a Person that is not a U.S.
resident individual or an entity that is not treated as a U.S. corporation or
partnership set forth in _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(B)(4)_), but otherwise
subject to compliance with this Agreement including _Section 4.7,_ each
Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to transfer any Series A
Preferred Units owned by such Series A Preferred Unitholder to any of its
Affiliates or to any other Series A Preferred Unitholder.

 



 

(B) Without the prior written consent of the Partnership, except as
specifically provided in the Series A Purchase Agreement or this Agreement,
each Series A Purchaser shall not, (1) during the period commencing on the
Series A Issuance Date and ending on [*], 2019, offer, sell, contract to sell,
sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to
sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise
transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of its Series A Preferred
Units, (2) during the period commencing on the Series A Issuance Date and
ending on [*], 2020, directly or indirectly engage in any short sales or other
derivative or hedging transactions with respect to the Series A Preferred
Units or Common Units that are designed to, or that might reasonably be
expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any Series A Preferred Units, (3)
transfer any Series A Preferred Units to any Competitor of the Partnership,
(4) transfer any Series A Preferred Units to any non-U.S. resident individual,
non-U.S. corporation or partnership, or any other non-U.S. entity, including
any foreign governmental entity (provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not apply if, prior to any such transfer or arrangement, such individual,
corporation, partnership or other entity establishes to the satisfaction of
the Partnership, its entitlement to a complete exemption from tax withholding,
including under Code Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1471 through 1474, and the
Treasury regulations thereunder), including by means of any swap or other
transaction or arrangement that transfers or that is designed to, or that
might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any Series A
Preferred Units, regardless of whether any transaction described in
_subclauses (1) Â— (4)_ above is to be settled by delivery of Series A
Preferred Units, Common Units or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or
(5) effect any transfer

 



      
 

 



 

of Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units in a manner that
violates the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Series A Preferred Unitholder may make a bona fide pledge of all or any
portion of its Series A Preferred Units to any holders of obligations owed by
such Series A Preferred Unitholder, including to the trustee for, or
representative of, such Series A Preferred Unitholder, and a foreclosure by
any such pledgee on any such pledged Series A Preferred Units shall not be
considered a violation or breach of this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)_, subject to
compliance with _subclauses (4)_ and _(5)_ above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any transferee receiving any Series A Preferred Units pursuant to
this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(B)_ shall agree to the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(B)_. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to
_subclauses (4)_ and _(5)_ above, in no way does this _Section
5.12(b)(viii)(B)_ prohibit changes in the composition of any Series A
Preferred Unitholder or its partners or members so long as such changes in
composition only relate to changes in direct or indirect ownership of such
Series A Preferred Unitholder among such Series A Preferred Unitholder, its
Affiliates and the limited partners of the private equity fund vehicles that
indirectly own such Series A Preferred Unitholder.

 



 

(C) Subject to _Section 4.7_, following [*], 2019, the Series A Preferred
Unitholders may freely transfer Series A Preferred Units, subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws and this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that this _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(C)_ shall not eliminate, modify
or reduce the obligations set forth in _subclauses (2)_ , _(3)_ , _(4)_ or
_(5)_ of _Section 5.12(b)(viii)(B)_.

 



 

(ix) _Optional Redemption_.

 



 

(A) On and after [*], 2023, the Partnership shall have the option, at any time
and from time to time, upon not less than 30 daysÂ’ written notice (each, a "
** _Series A Redemption Notice_**") to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, to
redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Units then Outstanding for
a redemption price in cash equal to the Series A Redemption Price per Series A
Preferred Unit; _provided_ that any such redemption shall be for an aggregate
value of at least $25 million or for all remaining Series A Preferred Units.
If fewer than all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units are to be
redeemed, any such redemption shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred
Unitholders on a Pro Rata basis (as nearly as practicable without creating
fractional Units) or on such other basis as may be agreed upon by the Series A
Preferred Unitholders.

 



 

(B) Each date fixed for redemption pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(ix)_ or
_Section 5.12(b)(x)_ is referred to as a " ** _Series A Redemption Date_**."
A Series A Redemption Notice will be irrevocable and will be delivered by the
Partnership not less than 30 days prior to the Series A Redemption Date,
addressed to the respective Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units to
be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear on the books and
records of the Partnership. No failure to give such notice or any defect
therein shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Series A Preferred Units except as to any Series A Preferred Unitholder to
whom the Partnership has failed

 



      
 

 



 

to give notice or except as to any Series A Preferred Unitholder to whom
notice was defective. In addition to any information required by applicable
law, such Series A Redemption Notice shall state: (1) the Series A Redemption
Date; (2) the Series A Redemption Price; and (3) whether all or less than all
the outstanding Series A Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the aggregate
amount of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed and, if less than all Series
A Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder are to be
redeemed, the percentage of Series A Preferred Units that will be redeemed.
The Series A Redemption Notice may also require delivery of Certificates
representing the Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed, if any, together
with certification as to the ownership of such Series A Preferred Units. Upon
the redemption of Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(ix)_, all rights of a Series A Preferred Unitholder with respect to
the redeemed Series A Preferred Units shall cease, and such redeemed Series A
Preferred Units shall cease to be Outstanding for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



 

(C) Upon any redemption of Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(ix)_, the Partnership shall pay to each Series A Preferred Unitholder
an amount in cash equal to the number of Series A Preferred Units being
redeemed from such Series A Preferred Unitholder, multiplied by the Series A
Redemption Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified by each such Series A Preferred Unitholder in writing to the General
Partner as requested in the Series A Redemption Notice.

 



 

(D) Nothing in this _Section 5.12(b)(ix)_, however, is intended to limit or
prevent a Series A Preferred Unitholder from electing to convert its Series A
Preferred Units into Common Units in accordance with _Section 5.12(b)(vi)_,
and the Partnership shall not have any right to redeem Series A Preferred
Units from a Series A Preferred Unitholder to the extent such Series A
Preferred Unitholder delivers a valid Series A Conversion Notice with respect
to such Series A Preferred Units notwithstanding whether such Series A
Preferred Units are the subject of a Series A Redemption Notice; _provided_
that such Series A Conversion Notice is delivered prior to the Series A
Redemption Date in respect of such Series A Redemption Notice.

 



 

(x) _Forced Redemption_.

 



 

(A) On and after [*], 2028, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall have the
right, at any time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 daysÂ’ written
notice (each, a " ** _Series A Forced Redemption Notice_**") to the
Partnership, to require the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the
Series A Preferred Units then held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder for
an amount equal to, the number of Series A Preferred Units indicated in such
Series A Forced Redemption Notice to be redeemed, multiplied by the sum of (1)
the Series A Issue Price, (2) Series A Unpaid Distributions on such Series A
Preferred Unit and (3) Series A Partial Period Distributions on such Series A
Preferred Unit (the " ** _Series A Forced Redemption Price_**"); _provided_
that any such redemption shall be for no less than the greater of

 



      
 

 



 

(x) Series A Preferred Units with a Series A Forced Redemption Price of at
least $25 million (taking into account the aggregate number of Series A
Preferred Units that are subject to Series A Forced Redemption Notices
delivered on the same day, regardless of whether from the same or multiple
Series A Preferred Unitholders) and (y) all of the Series A Preferred Units
held by the Series A Preferred Unitholder delivering such Series A Forced
Redemption Notice. If a Series A Preferred Unitholder exercises its redemption
right pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(x)_, the Partnership may elect to pay
up to 50% of the Series A Forced Redemption Price in Common Units; _provided_
, _however_ , that the number of Common Units issued pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(x)(A)_ with respect to the payment of any Series A Forced Redemption
Price may not exceed the number of Common Units as would cause the aggregate
number of Common Units issued pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(x)(A)_ to
exceed 15.0% of the total number of issued and outstanding Common Units as of
such Series A Redemption Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Common Units to be issued on such Series A Redemption Date). If the
Partnership elects to pay any portion of the Series A Forced Redemption Price
in Common Units pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(x)_, then the number of
Common Units to be issued shall equal the amount of such Series A Forced
Redemption Price to be paid in Common Units, divided by the product of (x) 93%
and (y) the Average VWAP for the 30 consecutive Trading Days ending
immediately prior to the Series A Redemption Date; _provided_ , that if such
calculation results in a fraction of a Common Unit being payable, the number
of Common Units to be issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Common
Unit with the remainder being paid in cash.

 



 

(B) A Series A Forced Redemption Notice will be irrevocable and will be
provided by the Series A Preferred Unitholder to the Partnership not less than
30 days prior to the Series A Redemption Date. In addition to any information
required by applicable law, such Series A Forced Redemption Notice shall
state: (1) the Series A Redemption Date; (2) the Series A Forced Redemption
Price; (3) the wire instructions of the Series A Preferred Unitholder; and (4)
the aggregate amount of Series A Preferred Units to be redeemed.

 



 

(C) Upon any redemption of Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.12(b)(x)_, the Partnership shall pay the cash portion of the Series A Forced
Redemption Price to the applicable Series A Preferred Unitholder by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by each such
Series A Preferred Unitholder in the Series A Forced Redemption Notice.

 



 

(D) If the Partnership elects to pay a portion of the Series A Forced
Redemption Price in Common Units in accordance with _Section 5.12(b)(x)(A)_,
the Partnership shall issue the applicable Common Units on the applicable
Series A Redemption Date. On the Series A Redemption Date, the Partnership
shall instruct, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause,
its Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Common Units issuable upon
redemption to such Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated recipient(s)),
by crediting the account of the Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated
recipient(s)) through its Deposit

 



      
 

 



 

Withdrawal Agent Commission system. The parties agree to coordinate with the
Transfer Agent to accomplish this objective.

 



 

(E) Immediately upon the issuance of Common Units as a result of any
redemption of Series A Preferred Units, the applicable Series A Preferred
Unitholder (or its designated recipient(s)) shall be treated for all purposes
as the owner of such Common Units, and all rights of the applicable Series A
Preferred Unitholder with respect to such redeemed Series A Preferred Units
shall cease, including any further accrual of distributions, but subject to
_Section 5.12(b)(i)(C)_. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.12(b)(x)(E)_ (each fractional Common Unit
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Common Unit with the remainder
being paid an amount in cash to be calculated based on the Closing Price of
Common Units on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Redemption
Date).

 



 

(xi) _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable_. Any Series A Conversion Unit(s)
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.12_ shall be validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable (except as such non-assessability may be affected by
matters described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act),
free and clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those
arising under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders
thereof. The Partnership shall keep authorized and unissued and free from
preemptive rights a sufficient number of Common Units to permit the conversion
of all outstanding Series A Preferred Units into Series A Conversion Units to
the extent provided in, and in accordance with, this _Section 5.12_.

 



 

(xii) _Notices._ The Partnership shall distribute to the Record Holders of
Series A Preferred Units copies of all notices, materials, annual and
quarterly reports, proxy statements, information statements and any other
documents distributed generally to the Record Holders of Common Units of the
Partnership, at such times and by such method as such documents are
distributed to such Record Holders of such Common Units.

 



 

(c) Each Series A Preferred Holder acknowledges and agrees to Section [4(k)]
of the Board Representation Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.13 _ Establishment of Class B Units_.

 



 

(a) There is hereby created a series of Units to be designated as "Class B
Units," consisting of a total of [*] Class B Units and having the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Class B Units_.

 



 

(i) On the next Business Day succeeding the Record Date attributable to the
Quarter ending [March 31, 2019] (such date, the " ** _Class B Conversion
Date_**"), each Class B Unit shall automatically be converted into one Common
Unit. Upon conversion, the rights of the holder of such Class B Units as
holder of Class B Units shall cease, including any rights under this
Agreement, except such Person shall continue to be a Limited Partner and shall
have the right to receive Common Units from the Partnership in conversion for
such Class B Units in accordance with this _Section 5.13(b)_, and such Class
B Units shall

 



      
 

 



 

upon the Class B Conversion Date be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled
by, the Partnership.

 



 

(ii) Each Class B Unit shall automatically be converted into one Common Unit
if the General Partner is removed pursuant to _Section 11.2_.

 



 

(iii) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Units
upon conversion of the Class B Units. However, the holder of such Common Units
shall pay any tax or duty which may be payable relating to any transfer
involving the issuance or delivery of Common Units in a name other than the
holderÂ’s name. The Transfer Agent may refuse to deliver the Certificate
representing Common Units (or notation of book entry) being issued in a name
other than the holderÂ’s name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum
sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due because the Common Units
are to be issued in a name other than the name of the holder of such Class B
Unit. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or
regulation.

 



 

(iv) The Partnership shall keep free from preemptive rights a sufficient
number of Common Units to permit the conversion of all outstanding Class B
Units into Common Units to the extent provided in, and in accordance with,
this _Section 5.13(b)_.

 



 

(v) All Common Units delivered upon conversion of the Class B Units shall be
newly issued, shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except
as such non-assessability may be affected by matters described in Sections
17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), free and clear of any liens,
claims, rights or encumbrances other than those arising under the Delaware Act
or this Agreement or created by the holders thereof.

 



 

(vi) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Common Units upon conversion of Class
B Units and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange, or any other National Securities Exchange or other market,
shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed and quoted the Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Class B Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall
give to any holder of Class B Units any rights as a creditor in respect solely
of its right to conversion.

 



 

(c) The Class B Units shall be entitled to receive allocations of items of
Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and credit under _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(d) The holder of a Class B Unit shall have all of the rights and obligations
of a Unitholder holding Common Units hereunder, except with respect to the
right to participate in distributions made prior to the Class B Conversion
Date with respect to Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that immediately
upon the conversion of a Class B Unit into a Common Unit pursuant to this
_Section 5.13_, the Unitholder holding such Common Unit issued upon
conversion of Class B Units shall possess all of the rights and obligations of
a Unitholder holding Common Units hereunder with respect to such Common Unit
issued upon conversion of Class B

 



      
 

 



 

Units, including the right to participate in distributions made with respect
to Common Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Common Units issued upon
conversion of Class B Units shall remain subject to the provisions of _Section
5.5(c)_, _Section 5.13(e)_, _Section 5.13(f)_ and _Section 6.1(d)(x)_.

 



 

(e) A Unitholder shall not be permitted to transfer a Class B Unit or a Common
Unit issued upon conversion of a Class B Unit pursuant to this _Section 5.13_
(other than a transfer to an Affiliate) if the remaining balance in the
transferring UnitholderÂ’s Capital Account after giving effect to the
allocation under _Section 5.5(c) _would be negative.

 



 

(f) A Unitholder holding Common Units issued upon conversion of Class B Units
pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall not be permitted to transfer such
Common Units to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder until such
time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that each
such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic
and federal income tax characteristics to the transferee, in all material
respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of
an Initial Common Unit to such transferee. In connection with the condition
imposed by this _Section 5.13(f)_, the General Partner may take whatever
steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such Common Units in
preparation for a transfer of such Common Units issued upon conversion of
Class B Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such steps may be taken that
would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units
(for this purpose the allocations of income, gain, loss and deductions or any
reallocation of Capital Account balances, among the Partners in accordance
with _Section 5.5(c)(ii)_ or _Section 6.1(d)(x)_ will be deemed not to have
a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units).

 



 

(g) The Class B Units will have such voting rights pursuant to this Agreement
as such Class B Units would have if they were Common Units that were then
Outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units as a single class,
except that the Class B Units shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on
any matter on which Unitholders are entitled to vote that adversely affects
the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of
Partnership Interests in any material respect or as required by law. The
approval of a majority of the Class B Units shall be required to approve any
matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are entitled to vote as a
separate class.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI. 
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_. For purposes of
maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners
among themselves, the PartnershipÂ’s items of income, gain, loss and deduction
(computed in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_) for each taxable period shall
be allocated among the Partners as provided herein.

 



 

(a) _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Income for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _First_ , to the General Partner until the aggregate amount of the Net
Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)(i)_
for the current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the aggregate of
the Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section
6.1(b)(iv)_ for all previous taxable periods; and

 



 

(ii) The balance, if any, to all Unitholders (other than the Series A
Preferred Unitholders), Pro Rata.

 



 

(b) _Net Loss_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Loss for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Loss for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 



 

(i) _First_ , to the Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders), Pro Rata; _ provided, however_, that Net Losses shall not be
allocated pursuant to this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ to the extent that such
allocation would cause any Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable period (or increase any
existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account);

 



 

(ii) _Second_ , to the Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred
Unitholders) to the extent of and in proportion to the positive balances in
their Adjusted Capital Accounts;

 



 

(iii) _Third_ , to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, to the extent of and in
proportion to the positive balances in their Adjusted Capital Accounts; and

 



 

(iv) _Fourth_ , the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner;

 



 

(c) _[Reserved]_.

 



 

(d) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 6.1_, the following special allocations shall be made for such
taxable period:

 



 

(i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this _Section 6.1_, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this _Section 6.1(d)_, each PartnerÂ’s Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain
required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other
allocations pursuant to this _ Section 6.1(d)_ with respect to such taxable
period (other than an allocation pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(vi)_ or _Section
6.1(d)(vii)_). This _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ is intended to comply with the
Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_ (other than _Section 6.1(d)(i)_),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease

 



       
 

 



 

in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable
period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at
the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of Partnership
income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the
manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and
1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes of this _Section
6.1(d)_, each PartnerÂ’s Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined,
and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected,
prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this _Section
6.1(d)_, other than _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ and other than an allocation pursuant
to _Section 6.1(d)(vi)_ or _Section 6.1(d)(vii)_, with respect to such
taxable period. This _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ is intended to comply with the
chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(iii) _Priority Allocations_. If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of
any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to
_Section 12.4_ or with respect to Series A Preferred Units) with respect to a
Unit exceeds the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property
distributed with respect to another Unit (the amount of the excess, an " **
_Excess Distribution_** " and the Unit with respect to which the greater
distribution is paid, an " ** _Excess Distribution Unit_** "), then there
shall be allocated gross income and gain to each Unitholder receiving an
Excess Distribution with respect to the Excess Distribution Unit until the
aggregate amount of such items allocated with respect to such Excess
Distribution Unit pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ for the current
taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the amount of the
Excess Distribution.

 



 

(iv) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this _Section
6.1(d)(iv)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as adjusted after all
other allocations provided for in this _Section 6.1_ have been tentatively
made as if this _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ were not in this Agreement.

 



 

(v) _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance
in its Capital Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum
of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed
obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;
_provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ shall be
made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance
in its Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in
this _Section 6.1_ have been tentatively made as if _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ and
this _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ were not in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines
that the PartnershipÂ’s Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a
different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

 



 

(vii) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

 



 

(viii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners Pro Rata; _provided_ , _however_ , that pursuant to Temporary
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5T(a)(2)(i), liabilities shall be allocated
for the purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5 in accordance with the
PartnersÂ’ interests in the PartnershipÂ’s profits, as determined by the General
Partner.

 



 

(ix) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(x) _Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law_.

 



 

(A) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems
appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost
recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the provisions
of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation
of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or
(y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner
Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt
such conventions, make such

 



      
 

 



 

allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this
_Section 6.1(d)(x)(A)_ only if such conventions, allocations or amendments
would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any
class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the
Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of
Section 704 of the Code.

 



 

(B) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of
Partnership property pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_ during any taxable period
of the Partnership ending before the conversion of Class B Units into Common
Units pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_, any Unrealized Gains and Unrealized
Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to the nearest
extent possible results in the Capital Account maintained with respect to each
such Class B Units equaling the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common
Unit.

 



 

(C) With respect to an event triggering an adjustment to the Carrying Value of
Partnership property pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_ during any taxable period
of the Partnership ending upon, or after, the conversion of Class B Units into
Common Units pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_, any Unrealized Gains and
Unrealized Losses shall be allocated among the Partners in a manner that to
the nearest extent possible results in the Capital Account maintained with
respect to each such Common Unit issued upon conversion of Class B Units
equaling the Per Unit Capital Amount for an Initial Common Unit.

 



 

(xi) _Allocations with Respect to Series A Preferred Units._ Notwithstanding
any other provision of this _Section 6.1_ (other than the Required
Allocations):

 



 

(A) Items of Partnership gross income and gain for the taxable period shall be
allocated to the holders of Series A Preferred Units in proportion to, and to
the extent of, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the Series A
Issue Price with respect to such holderÂ’s Series A Preferred Units, over (2)
such holderÂ’s existing Capital Account balance in respect of such Series A
Preferred Units, until the Capital Account balance of each such holder in
respect of its Series A Preferred Units is equal to the Series A Issue Price
with respect to such holderÂ’s Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(B) Items of Partnership gross income shall be allocated to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders, Pro Rata, until the aggregate amount of gross income
allocated to each Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant hereto for the
current taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the
cumulative amount of all Net Losses allocated to such Series A Preferred
Unitholder pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_ for all previous taxable years.

 



 

(C) If (A) prior to the conversion of the last Outstanding Series A Preferred
Unit (i) the Liquidation Date occurs or (ii) Sale Gain or Sale Loss is
recognized, and (B) after having made all other allocations provided for in
this _Section 6.1_ for the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date
occurs or Sale Gain or Sale Loss is recognized, the Per Unit Capital Amount of
each Series A Preferred

 



      
 

 



 

Unit does not equal or exceed the Series A Liquidation Value, then items of
gross income, gain, loss and deduction for such taxable period shall be
allocated among the Partners in a manner determined appropriate by the General
Partner so as to cause, to the maximum extent possible, the Per Unit Capital
Amount in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit to equal the Series A
Liquidation Value (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall
reverse the effect of such allocation). For the avoidance of doubt, the
reallocation of items set forth in the immediately preceding sentence provides
that, to the extent necessary to achieve the Per Unit Capital Amount balances
described above, items of gross income and gain that would otherwise be
included in Net Income or Net Loss, as the case may be, for the taxable period
in which the Liquidation Date occurs or Sale Gain or Sale Loss is recognized,
reallocated from the Unitholders holding Units other than Series A Preferred
Units to Unitholders holding Series A Preferred Units. If (i) the Liquidation
Date occurs or Sale Gain or Sale Loss is recognized on or before the date (not
including any extension of time) prescribed by law for the filing of the
PartnershipÂ’s federal income tax return for the taxable period immediately
prior to the taxable period in which the Liquidation Date occurs or Sale Gain
or Sale Loss is recognized and (ii) the reallocation of items for the taxable
period in which the Liquidation Date occurs or Sale Gain or Sale Loss is
recognized as set forth above in this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)_ fails to
achieve the Per Unit Capital Amounts described above, then items of gross
income, gain, loss and deduction for such prior taxable period shall be
reallocated among all Partners in a manner that will, to the maximum extent
possible and after taking into account all other allocations made pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)_, cause the Per Unit Capital Amount in respect of
each Series A Preferred Unit to equal the Series A Liquidation Value.

 



 

(xii) _Curative Allocation_.

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.1_, other than the
Required Allocations and other than _Section 6.1(d)(xi)_, the Required
Allocations shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so
that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of gross income, gain,
loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required
Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net
amount of such items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under
the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative
Allocation not otherwise been provided in this _Section 6.1_. In exercising
its discretion under this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)_, the General Partner may
take into account future Required Allocations that, although not yet made, are
likely to offset other Required Allocations previously made. Allocations
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)_ shall only be made with respect to
Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such
allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among
the Partners.

 



 

(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of _Section 6.1(d)(xii)(A)_ in whatever order is most likely
to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required

 



      
 

 



 

Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(xii)(A)_ among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

 



 

(xiii) _Exercise of Noncompensatory Options_. In accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s) and as provided in _Section 5.5(d)_,
immediately after the exercise of a 2018 Warrant or the conversion of a
Limited Partner Interest into Common Units (each such Common Unit a " **
_Conversion Unit_** ") upon the exercise of a noncompensatory option, the
Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall be adjusted to reflect its
fair market value immediately after such conversion and any resulting
Unrealized Gain (if the Capital Account of each such Conversion Unit is less
than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit)
or Unrealized Loss (if the Capital Account of each such Conversion Unit is
greater than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding Initial
Common Unit) will be allocated to each Partner holding Conversion Units in
proportion to and to the extent of the amount necessary to cause the Capital
Account of each such Conversion Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for
a then Outstanding Initial Common Unit. Any remaining Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss will be allocated to the Partners pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)_.

 



 

(xiv) _[Reserved]_.

 



 

(xv) _Special Allocation in Connection with Equity Restructuring Agreement_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.1_, the General
Partner shall have the discretion to allocate income, gain, loss and deduction
for the taxable year that includes the closing date of the Equity
Restructuring Agreement in a manner which is reasonably determined to result
in each Unit (including the Units issued pursuant to the Equity Restructuring
Agreement) having the same Per Unit Capital Amount.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners
in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or
deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined appropriate by the
General Partner (taking into account the General PartnerÂ’s discretion under
_Section 6.1(d)(x)_); _provided_ , that the General Partner shall apply the
principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.

 



 

(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of
an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations
thereto. If the

 



      
 

 



 

General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be
taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions
under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same
month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the
same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the
PartnershipÂ’s property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such
aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and
amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax
characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions
would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record
Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions
and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest)
have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

 



 

(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the
Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that such allocations, once made, shall
be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into
account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the
Code.

 



 

(f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall, for
federal income tax purposes, be determined for each taxable period and
prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the
opening of the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests
are listed or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month;
_provided_ , _however_ , that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of
any assets of the Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income, gain,
loss or deduction as determined by the General Partner, shall be allocated to
the Partners as of the opening of the National Securities Exchange on which
the Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading on the first
Business Day of the month in which such item is recognized for federal income
tax purposes. The General Partner may revise, alter or otherwise modify such
methods of allocation to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of
the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(g) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the
nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in
accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by
the General Partner.

 



 

(h) If, as a result of an exercise of a Noncompensatory Option, a Capital
Account reallocation is required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x). In the event such
corrective allocations are necessary, the Series A Preferred Unitholders agree
to remain a partner of the Partnership until such allocations are completed,
and

 



      
 

 



 

the General Partner agrees to make such allocations as soon as practicable,
even if such allocations are not consistent with Section 706 of the Code and
any Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders_.

 



 

(a) Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter commencing with the
Quarter ending on March 31, 2013, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash
with respect to such Quarter shall be distributed first to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders in accordance with _Section 5.12_, and the balance in
accordance with this _Article VI_ by the Partnership to Partners, Pro Rata,
as of the Record Date selected by the General Partner. All amounts of
Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on any date from any source
shall be deemed to be Operating Surplus until the sum of all amounts of
Available Cash theretofore distributed by the Partnership to the Partners
equals the Operating Surplus from the Closing Date through the close of the
immediately preceding Quarter. Any remaining amounts of Available Cash
distributed by the Partnership on such date shall be deemed to be " **
_Capital Surplus_**." Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, all distributions required to be made under this Agreement
shall be made subject to Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act and
any other applicable law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_, in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter
in which the Liquidation Date occurs, other than from Working Capital
Borrowings, shall be applied and distributed solely in accordance with, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section 12.4_.

 



 

(c) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through any Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the PartnershipÂ’s liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The Partnership shall not make any distribution of Available Cash or other
property of the Partnership to holders of Class B Units pursuant to Section
6.3(a) prior to the Class B Conversion Date.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_, but subject to Sections 17-607 and
17-804 of the Delaware Act, (i) the General Partner may cause the Partnership
to make special distributions of cash or cash equivalents in connection with
contributions of assets by Partners or by Persons who shall become Partners by
virtue of such contribution, (ii) such distributions shall not be subject to,
or considered as distributions under, _Section 5.12(b)(i)(B)_, _Section
6.1(d)(iii)_, or the second and third sentences of _Section 6.3(a)_ and (iii)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_), no Partner shall receive an allocation of
income (including gross income) or gain as a result of receiving a
distribution provided for in this _Section 6.3(e)_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Special Provisions Relating to Series A Preferred Units._

 



 

(a) Subject to any applicable transfer restrictions in _Section 4.7_ or
_Section 5.12(b)(viii)_, the holder of a Series A Conversion Unit shall
provide notice to the Partnership of the transfer of any such Series A
Conversion Unit, as applicable, by the earlier of (i) 30 days following such
transfer and (ii) the last Business Day of the calendar year during which such
transfer occurred, unless, with respect to a transfer of a Series A Conversion
Unit, by virtue of the application of _Section 5.5(d)_ or _Section
6.1(d)(xiii)_, the Partnership has previously determined, based on the advice
of counsel, that the transferred Series A Conversion Unit should have, as a
substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax
characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In connection with the condition
imposed by this _Section 6.4_, the Partnership shall take whatever steps are
required to provide economic uniformity to the Series A Conversion Unit in
preparation for a transfer of such Unit; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the
Unitholders holding Common Units (for this purpose the allocations of income,
gain, loss and deductions, and the making of any guaranteed payments or any
reallocation of Capital Account balances, among the Partners in accordance
with _Section 5.5(d)_, _Section 6.1(d)(xiii)_ and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4) with respect to Series A Conversion Units will
be deemed not to have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding
Common Units).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Series A Preferred Units (i) shall (A) possess the rights and
obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner
pursuant to _Article III_ and _Article VII_ and (B) have a Capital Account
as a Partner pursuant to _Section 5.5_ and all other provisions related
thereto and (ii) shall not be entitled to any distributions other than as
provided in _Section 5.12_ and _Article VI_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Application of Section 6.1 and Section 6.2_. With respect to the
portion of the taxable year through the date hereof and any prior taxable
years, each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction shall be
allocated among the Partners in accordance with Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 of
the 2013 Agreement. Thereafter, each item of Partnership income, gain, loss
and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Special Provisions Relating to 2018 Warrants_. A Unitholder
holding a Common Unit that has resulted from the exercise of a 2018 Warrant
shall not be issued a Common Unit Certificate pursuant to _Section 4.1_, if
the Common Units are evidenced by Certificates, and shall not be permitted to
transfer such Common Unit to a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder
until such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel,
that each such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like
intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material
respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of
a Common Unit, provided that in all events such determination shall be made
within 5 Business Days of the date of the exercise of a 2018 Warrant. In
connection with the condition imposed by this _Section 6.6_, the General
Partner shall act in good faith to provide economic uniformity to such Common
Units in preparation for a transfer of such Common Units, including the
application of this _Section 6.6_; _provided, however_ , that no such steps
may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders
holding Common Units.

(vi) the distribution of Partnership cash;

 



 

(vii) the selection and dismissal of employees (including employees having

Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each of
the Partners and each other Person who may acquire an interest in Partnership
Interests or is otherwise bound by this Agreement hereby (i) approves,
ratifies and confirms the execution, delivery and performance by the parties
thereto of this Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement and the other agreements
described in or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that are
related to the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statement
(collectively, the " ** _Transaction Documents_** ") (in each case other than
this Agreement, without giving effect to any amendments, supplements or

 



       
 

 



 

restatements after the date hereof); (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on
its own or on behalf of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and
perform the agreements referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the
other agreements, acts, transactions and matters described in or contemplated
by the Registration Statement on behalf of the Partnership without any further
act, approval or vote of the Partners or the other Persons who may acquire an
interest in Partnership Interests or are otherwise bound by this Agreement;
and (iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance by the General
Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate of any of them of this Agreement or
any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement (including the
exercise by the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner of the
rights accorded pursuant to _Article XV_) shall not constitute a breach by
the General Partner of any duty that the General Partner may owe the
Partnership or the Limited Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement
(or any other agreements) or of any duty existing at law, in equity or
otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Replacement of Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, to the extent that any provision of this
Agreement (i) replaces, restricts or eliminates the duties (including
fiduciary duties) that might otherwise, as a result of Delaware or other
applicable law, be owed by the General Partner, the Board of Directors, any
committee thereof or any other Indemnitee to the Partnership, the Limited
Partners, any other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest
or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement, or (ii) constitutes a
waiver or consent by the Partnership, the Limited Partners, any other Person
who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person who is
bound by this Agreement to any such replacement, restriction or elimination,
such provision is hereby approved by the Partnership, all the Partners, each
other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest and each other
Person who is bound by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Certificate of Limited Partnership_. The General Partner has
caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act. The General
Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other
certificates or documents that the General Partner determines to be necessary
or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of
a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent the
General Partner determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the
General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate
of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a
limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited
partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of
any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. Subject to the terms of _Section 3.4(a)_, the General Partner shall
not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the
Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification document or any
amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

series of related transactions without the approval of holders of a Unit
Majority; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not preclude or
limit the General PartnerÂ’s ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant
a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership Group and shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of the
assets of

 



      
 

 



 

the Partnership Group pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization
upon, any such encumbrance.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Reimbursement of the General Partner_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 7.5_ and elsewhere in this Agreement,
the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general
partner or managing member of any Group Member.

 



 

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other
basis as the General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and indirect
expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership Group
(including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any
Person, including Affiliates of the General Partner, to perform services for
the Partnership Group or for the General Partner in the discharge of its
duties to the Partnership Group), and (ii) all other expenses allocable to the
Partnership Group or otherwise incurred by the General Partner in connection
with operating the Partnership GroupÂ’s business (including expenses allocated
to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The General Partner shall determine
the expenses that are allocable to the General Partner or the Partnership
Group. Reimbursements pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall be in addition to
any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.8_.

 



 

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership benefit plans, programs and practices (including
plans, programs and practices involving the issuance of Partnership Interests
or options to purchase or rights, warrants or appreciation rights or phantom
or tracking interests relating to Partnership Interests), or cause the
Partnership to issue Partnership Interests in connection with, or pursuant to,
any benefit plan, program or practice maintained or sponsored by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates, in each case for the benefit of employees
and directors of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in respect of
services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership
Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any
of its Affiliates any Partnership Interests that the General Partner or such
Affiliates are obligated to provide to any employees and directors pursuant to
any such benefit plans, programs or practices. Expenses incurred by the
General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and practices
(including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of
Partnership Interests purchased by the General Partner or such Affiliates,
from the Partnership, to fulfill options or awards under such plans, programs
and practices) shall be reimbursed in accordance with _Section 7.5(b)_. Any
and all obligations of the General Partner under any benefit plans, programs
or practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this _Section
7.5(c)_ shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and
shall be assumed by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ or the transferee of or successor to all of
the General PartnerÂ’s General Partner Interest pursuant to _Section 4.6_.

 



 

(d) The General Partner and its Affiliates may charge any member of the
Partnership Group a management fee to the extent necessary to allow the
Partnership Group to reduce the amount of any state franchise or income tax or
any tax based upon the revenues or gross margin

 



      
 

 



 

of any member of the Partnership Group if the tax benefit produced by the
payment of such management fee or fees exceeds the amount of such fee or fees.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Outside Activities_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner, for so long as it is the General Partner of the
Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general
partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any
other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake activities that
are ancillary or related thereto (including being a Limited Partner in the
Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity or incur
any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its
performance as general partner or managing member, if any, of one or more
Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt securities or equity
interests in any Group Member or (C) the guarantee of, and mortgage, pledge,
or encumbrance of any or all of its assets in connection with, any
indebtedness of any Affiliate of the General Partner.

 



 

(b) Each Unrestricted Person (other than the General Partner) shall have the
right to engage in businesses of every type and description and other
activities for profit and to engage in and possess an interest in other
business ventures of any and every type or description, whether in businesses
engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in by any Group Member, independently
or with others, including business interests and activities in direct
competition with the business and activities of any Group Member, and none of
the same shall constitute a breach of this Agreement or any duty otherwise
existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to any Group Member or any Partner or
any other Person bound by this Agreement. None of any Group Member, any
Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership relationship
established hereby in any business ventures of any Unrestricted Person.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms of _Sections 7.6(a)_ and _(b)_ , but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging
in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the General
Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.6_ is hereby
approved by the Partnership, all Partners, and all other Persons bound by this
Agreement, (ii) it shall not be a breach of any fiduciary duty or any other
obligation of any type whatsoever of the General Partner or any other
Unrestricted Person for the Unrestricted Persons (other than the General
Partner) to engage in such business interests and activities in preference to
or to the exclusion of the Partnership or any other Group Member and (iii) the
Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation hereunder or as a result of any
duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to present business
opportunities to the Partnership or any other Group Member. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of corporate
opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted
Person (including the General Partner). No Unrestricted Person (including the
General Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for any Group Member,
shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to any Group
Member, and such Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) shall not
be liable to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, any other Person who
acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person who is
bound by this Agreement for breach of any fiduciary or other

 



      
 

 



 

duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise by reason of the fact that such
Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) pursues or acquires for
itself, directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate
such opportunity or information to any Group Member; _provided_ such
Unrestricted Person does not engage in such business or activity as a result
of or using confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf
of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person.

 



 

(d) The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Interests in addition to those acquired on the Closing Date and,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise,
at their option, all rights relating to all Units and/or other Partnership
Interests acquired by them. The term " ** _Affiliates_** " when used in this
_Section 7.6(d)_ with respect to the General Partner shall not include any
Group Member.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect any separate contractual
obligations outside of this Agreement of any Person (including any
Unrestricted Person) to the Partnership or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership or Group Members_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may, but shall be under no
obligation to, lend to any Group Member, and any Group Member may borrow from
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the
Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the General
Partner may determine; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case the
lending party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater
than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms
materially less favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or
imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made
on an armÂ’s-length basis (without reference to the lending partyÂ’s financial
abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the General Partner. The
borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than
any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection
with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this _Section 7.7(a)_ and
_Section 7.7(b)_, the term " ** _Group Member_** " shall include any
Affiliate of a Group Member that is controlled by the Group Member.

 



 

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner. No Group Member may lend funds to the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member).

 



 

(c) No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty hereunder or
otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, of the General Partner or
its Affiliates to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by reason of the
fact that the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to
enable distributions to the General Partner or its Affiliates (including in
their capacities as Limited Partners) to exceed the General PartnerÂ’s
Percentage Interest of the total amount distributed to all Partners.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.8 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Partnership on an after tax basis from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all threatened, pending or
completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and
including appeals, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened
to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as an
Indemnitee and acting (or refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or
for the benefit of the Partnership; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee shall not
be indemnified and held harmless pursuant to this Agreement if there has been
a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the
Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnitee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in
the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the IndemniteeÂ’s
conduct was unlawful; _provided_ , _further_ , no indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 7.8_ shall be available to any Affiliate of the General Partner
(other than a Group Member), or to any other Indemnitee, with respect to any
such AffiliateÂ’s obligations pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Any
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not
be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to
contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to
effectuate such indemnification.

 



 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to _Section
7.8(a)_ in appearing at, participating in or defending any claim, demand,
action, suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the
Partnership prior to a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which
the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.8_, the
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership
of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if
it shall be ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified as authorized by this _Section 7.8_.

 



 

(c) The indemnification provided by this _Section 7.8_ shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any
agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests entitled to vote, as a matter of law, in equity or otherwise, both
as to actions in the IndemniteeÂ’s capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions
in any other capacity (including any capacity under the Underwriting
Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns
and administrators of the Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates, the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General
Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against,
or expense that may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the
PartnershipÂ’s or any other Group MemberÂ’s activities or such PersonÂ’s
activities on behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

the Partnership or any other Group Member, regardless of whether the
Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 7.8_, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of _Section 7.8(a)_; and action taken
or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance
of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to
be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

 



 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this _Section 7.8_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.8_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other
Persons.

 



 

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.8_ or any
provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of
any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership,
nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under
and in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.8_ as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

(j) If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of the
action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is being sought) or
advancement of expenses under this _Section 7.8_ is not paid in full within
thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by any Indemnitee has been
received by the Partnership, such Indemnitee may file suit to recover the
unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be
entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim, including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees. In any such action the Partnership shall have the
burden of proving that such Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law.

 



 

(k) This _Section 7.8_ shall not limit the right of the Partnership, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance
expenses to, and purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of, Persons other
than Indemnitees.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.9 _Liability of Indemnitees_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, any other
Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other Person
who is bound by this Agreement, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred
as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee, including any breach of
contract (including breach of this Agreement) or any breach of duties
(including breach of fiduciary duties) whether arising hereunder, at law, in
equity or otherwise unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of
the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the IndemniteeÂ’s conduct was
criminal. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited Partners, any
other Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other
Person who is bound by this Agreement waives any and all rights to claim
punitive damages or damages based upon the Federal, State or other income
taxes paid or payable by any such Limited Partner or other Person.

 



 

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
_Section 7.1(a)_, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted
to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall be responsible for any misconduct,
negligence or wrong doing on the part of any such agent appointed by the
General Partner or any such Indemnitee in good faith.

 



 

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership, the Partners, any Person who acquires an interest in a
Partnership Interest, or any other Person bound by this Agreement, the General
Partner and any other Indemnitee acting in connection with the PartnershipÂ’s
business or affairs shall not be liable to the Partnership, to any Partner, or
to any Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest, or any other
Person bound by this Agreement for its good faith reliance on the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.9_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this _Section 7.9_ as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member
Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between
the General Partner (in its individual capacity or its capacity as general
partner or limited partner) or any of its Affiliates or Associates or any
Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Partnership, any Group Member or any
Partner, on the other, any resolution or course of action by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates or Associates or any Indemnitee in respect of
such conflict of interest shall be

 



      
 

 



 

permitted and deemed approved by all Partners, and shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member Agreement, of any agreement
contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty hereunder or existing at law,
in equity or otherwise, if the resolution or course of action in respect of
such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) approved
by the vote of holders of a majority of the Common Units (excluding Common
Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates), (iii) on terms no less
favorable to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or
available from unrelated third parties or (iv) fair and reasonable to the
Partnership, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the
parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly
favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General Partner shall be
authorized but not required in connection with its resolution of such conflict
of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval of such
resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of
action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder approval.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or applicable law, if
Special Approval is sought or obtained, then it shall be conclusively deemed
that, in making its decision, the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and
if neither Special Approval nor Unitholder approval is sought or obtained and
the Board of Directors determines that the resolution or course of action
taken with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards
set forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be presumed that, in
making its decision, the Board of Directors acted in good faith, and in any
proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited
Partner or any other Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging such
approval, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the
burden of overcoming such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity,
the existence of the conflicts of interest described in the Registration
Statement and any actions of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates or
Associates or any other Indemnitee taken in connection therewith are hereby
approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
or of any duty hereunder or existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Whenever the General Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or
declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate, Associate or Indemnitee
of the General Partner causes the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as
the general partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its individual
capacity, whether under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
hereby or otherwise, then, unless another express standard is provided for in
this Agreement, the General Partner, the Board of Directors, such committee,
or such Affiliate, Associate or Indemnitee causing the General Partner to do
so, shall make such determination or take or decline to take such other action
in good faith and shall not be subject to any other or different standards
(including fiduciary standards) imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act
or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. A determination or other
action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in "good faith" for all
purposes of this Agreement, if the Person or Persons making such determination
or taking or declining to take such other action subjectively believe that the
determination or other action or inaction is in the best interests of the
Partnership Group; _provided_ , that if the Board of Directors is making a
determination or taking or declining to take an action pursuant to clause
(iii) or clause (iv) of the first sentence of _Section 7.10(a)_, then in lieu
thereof, such determination or other action or inaction will conclusively be
deemed to be in "good faith" for all purposes of this Agreement if the members
of the Board of Directors making such determination or taking or declining to
take such

 



      
 

 



 

other action subjectively believe that the determination or other action or
inaction meets the standard set forth in clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the
first sentence of _Section 7.10(a)_, as applicable; _provided further_ , that
if the Board of Directors is making a determination that a director satisfies
the eligibility requirements to be a member of a Conflicts Committee, then in
lieu thereof, such determination will conclusively be deemed to be in "good
faith" for all purposes of this Agreement if the members of the Board of
Directors making such determination subjectively believe that the director
satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a member of the Conflicts
Committee. In any proceeding brought by the Partnership, any Limited Partner
or any Person who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest or any other
Person who is bound by this Agreement challenging such action, determination
or inaction, the Person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the
burden of proving that such determination, action or inaction was not in good
faith.

 



 

(c) Whenever the General Partner (including the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof) makes a determination or takes or declines to take any
other action, or any of its Affiliates or Associates or any Indemnitee causes
it to do so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the
general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group
Member Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then
the General Partner, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or such
Affiliates or Associates or any Indemnitee causing it to do so, are entitled,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take
or decline to take such other action free of any duty (including any fiduciary
or other duty) existing at law, in equity or otherwise or obligation
whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, any other Person who
acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest and any other Person bound by
this Agreement, and the General Partner, the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, or such Affiliates or Associates or any Indemnitee causing
it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to
act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement,
any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under
the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. By way of
illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrases, "at the option of
the General Partner," "in its sole discretion" or some variation of those
phrases, are used in this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is
acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the
General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from
voting or transferring its Partnership Interests, or otherwise acts in its
capacity as a limited partner or holder of Limited Partner Interests, it shall
be acting in its individual capacity.

 



 

(d) The General PartnerÂ’s organizational documents may provide that
determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather
than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if
the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the
General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the
General PartnerÂ’s general partner, if the General Partner is a limited
partnership.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General
Partner or any other Indemnitee shall have no duty or obligation, express or
implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership
Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group
Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to
time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be in its
sole discretion.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
otherwise applicable provision of law or in equity, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the
General Partner, the Board of Directors, any committee thereof or any other
Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties,
to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this
Agreement, and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they
restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including
fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise
existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other
duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee.

 



 

(g) The Limited Partners, each Person who acquires an interest in a
Partnership Interest and each other Person who is bound by this Agreement,
hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership as a
partner or member of a Group Member, to approve actions by the general partner
or managing member of such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to
be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 7.10_.

 



 

(h) The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is
under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the Limited Partners
(including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners based
on their particular circumstances) in deciding whether to cause the
Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions, and that the General
Partner shall not be liable to the Limited Partners for monetary damages or
equitable relief for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not
derived by Limited Partners in connection with such decisions.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely upon, and shall be
protected from liability to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, any Person
who acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest, and any other Person bound
by this Agreement in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 



 

(b) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may consult with legal
counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers
and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an
Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner or
such Indemnitee reasonably believes to be within such PersonÂ’s professional or
expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted
in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests_. The General Partner
may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership
Interests or options, rights, warrants,

 



       
 

 



 

appreciation rights or phantom or tracking interests relating to Partnership
Interests. As long as Partnership Interests are held by any Group Member, such
Partnership Interests shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose,
except as otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of
the General Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or
otherwise dispose of Partnership Interests for its own account, subject to the
provisions of _Articles IV_ and _X_.

 



 

Section 7.13 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates_.

 



 

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including, for purposes of this _Section 7.13_, any Person that is an
Affiliate of the General Partner at the Closing Date notwithstanding that it
may later cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner, but excluding any
individual who is an Affiliate of the General Partner based on such
individualÂ’s status as an officer, director or employee of the General Partner
or of an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership Interests that it
desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule
or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not
available to enable such holder of Partnership Interests (the " ** _Holder_**
") to dispose of the number of Partnership Interests it desires to sell at the
time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act, then
at the option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall file
with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and
remain effective for a period of not less than six months following its
effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership
Interests covered by such registration statement have been sold, a
registration statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and
sale of the number of Partnership Interests specified by the Holder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required to effect
more than four registrations in total pursuant to this _Section 7.13(a)_ and
_Section 7.13(b)_, no more than two of which shall be required to be made at
any time that the Partnership is not eligible to use Form S-3 (or a comparable
form) for the registration under the Securities Act of its securities; and
_provided further_ , _however_ , that if the Conflicts Committee determines
that the requested registration would be materially detrimental to the
Partnership and its Partners because such registration would (x) materially
interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar
transaction involving the Partnership, (y) require premature disclosure of
material information that the Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for
preserving as confidential or (z) render the Partnership unable to comply with
requirements under applicable securities laws, then the Partnership shall have
the right to postpone such requested registration for a period of not more
than six months after receipt of the HolderÂ’s request, such right pursuant to
this _Section 7.13(a)_ or _Section 7.13(b)_ not to be utilized more than
once in any twelve-month period. In connection with any registration pursuant
to the first sentence of this _Section 7.13(a)_, the Partnership shall (i)
promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register
or qualify the securities subject to such registration under the securities
laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction
where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject to general
service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign
corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a
result of such registration, and (B) such documents as may be necessary to
apply for listing or to list the Partnership Interests subject to such
registration on such National Securities Exchange as the Holder shall
reasonably request and (ii) do any and all other acts and things that may be
necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to

 



      
 

 



 

consummate a public sale of such Partnership Interests in such states. Except
as set forth in _Section 7.13(d)_, all costs and expenses of any such
registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and
commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the
Holder.

 



 

(b) If any Holder holds Partnership Interests that it desires to sell and Rule
144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or
another exemption from registration is not available to enable such Holder to
dispose of the number of Partnership Interests it desires to sell at the time
it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act, then at the
option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall file with the
Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain
effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective
date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all Partnership Interests
covered by such shelf registration statement have been sold, a "shelf"
registration statement covering the Partnership Interests specified by the
Holder on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under the Securities Act, or any
similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership shall not be required to effect more than four
registrations pursuant to _Section 7.13(a)_ and this _Section 7.13(b)_; and
_provided further_ , _however_ , that if the Conflicts Committee determines
that any offering under, or the use of any prospectus forming a part of, the
shelf registration statement would be materially detrimental to the
Partnership and its Partners because such offering or use would (x) materially
interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar
transaction involving the Partnership, (y) require premature disclosure of
material information that the Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for
preserving as confidential or (z) render the Partnership unable to comply with
requirements under applicable securities laws, then the Partnership shall have
the right to suspend such offering or use for a period of not more than six
months after receipt of the HolderÂ’s request, such right pursuant to _Section
7.13(a)_ or this _Section 7.13(b)_ not to be utilized more than once in any
twelve-month period. In connection with any shelf registration pursuant to
this _Section 7.13(b)_, the Partnership shall (i) promptly prepare and file
(A) such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities
subject to such shelf registration under the securities laws of such states as
the Holder shall reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, the Partnership would become subject to general service of process or
to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or
partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such
shelf registration, and (B) such documents as may be necessary to apply for
listing or to list the Partnership Interests subject to such shelf
registration on such National Securities Exchange as the Holder shall
reasonably request, and (ii) do any and all other acts and things that may be
necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of
such Partnership Interests in such states. Except as set forth in _Section
7.13(d)_, all costs and expenses of any such shelf registration and offering
(other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the
Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

 



 

(c) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan), the Partnership shall notify each Holder that is an Affiliate
of the Partnership at the time of such proposal and use all reasonable efforts
to include such number or amount of securities held by such Holder in such
registration statement as it shall

 



      
 

 



 

request; _provided_ , that the Partnership is not required to make any effort
or take any action to so include the securities of such Holder once the
registration statement is declared effective by the Commission or otherwise
becomes effective, including any registration statement providing for the
offering from time to time of securities pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act. If the proposed offering pursuant to this _Section 7.13(c)_
shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the event that the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise the Partnership
and such Holder in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of all or some
of the HolderÂ’s Partnership Interests would have a material adverse effect on
the success of the offering, the Partnership shall include in such offering
only that number or amount, if any, of securities held by such Holder that, in
the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, will not
have a material adverse effect on the success of the offering. Except as set
forth in _Section 7.13(d)_, all costs and expenses of any such registration
and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be
paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by such Holder.

 



 

(d) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this _Section 7.13_, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the PartnershipÂ’s obligation under
_Section 7.8_, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, " ** _Indemnified Persons_** ") from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several,
expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,

(and any of the General PartnerÂ’s Affiliates) after it ceases to be a general
partner of the Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the
effective date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for
the Holder to sell all of the Partnership Interests with respect to which it
has requested during such

obligations) by a Holder to a transferee of such Partnership Interests,
_provided_ (i) the Partnership is, within a reasonable time after such

transferee and the Partnership Interests with respect to which such
registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this _Section

Section 7.14 _Reliance by Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be
entitled to assume that the General Partner and any officer of the General
Partner authorized by the General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name
of the Partnership has full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise
use in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any
authorized contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the General Partner or any such officer as if it were
the PartnershipÂ’s sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each
Limited Partner hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and
all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to
contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such
officer in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person
dealing with the General Partner or any such officer or its representatives be

thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed

reasonable period of time. The books of the Partnership shall be maintained,
for financial reporting purposes, on an accrual basis in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The Partnership shall not be required to keep books maintained on a cash
basis and the General Partner shall be permitted to calculate cash-based
measures, including Operating Surplus, by making such adjustments to its
accrual basis books to account for non-cash items and other adjustments as the
General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be a
fiscal year ending December 31.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the close

mailed or made available, by any reasonable means, to each Record Holder of a
Unit as of a date selected by the General Partner, an annual report containing
financial statements of the Partnership for such fiscal year of the

other information as may be required by applicable law, regulation or rule of
any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to
trading, or as the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall be deemed to have made a report available to
each Record Holder as required by this _Section 8.3_ if it has either (i)
filed such report with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval system and such report is publicly available on such
system or (ii) made such report available on any publicly available website
maintained by the Partnership.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX. 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Tax Returns and Information_. The Partnership shall timely file
all returns of the Partnership that are required for federal, state and local
income tax purposes on the basis of the accrual method and the taxable period
or years that it is required by law to adopt, from time to

 



      
 

 



 

time, as determined by the General Partner. In the event the Partnership is
required to use a taxable period other than a year ending on December 31, the
General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to change the taxable period of
the Partnership to a year ending on December 31. The tax information
reasonably required by Record Holders for federal and state income tax

taxable period ends, subject to Section 5.06 of the Series A Purchase
Agreement. The classification, realization and recognition of income, gain,
losses and deductions and other items shall be on the accrual method of

Section 9.2 _Tax Elections_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General PartnerÂ’s
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the
General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention
whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest will be
deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited Partner Interests
on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests
are listed or admitted to trading during the calendar month in which such
transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_ without regard to
the actual price paid by such transferee.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine
whether the Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Tax Controversies_. Subject to the provisions hereof, the General
Partner is designated as the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in Section
6231(a)(7) of the Code as in effect prior to the enactment of the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015), and the "partnership representative" (as defined in
Section 6223 of the Code following the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act
of 2015) and is authorized and required to represent the Partnership (at the
PartnershipÂ’s expense) in connection with all examinations of the
PartnershipÂ’s affairs by tax authorities, including resulting administrative
and judicial proceedings, and to expend Partnership funds for professional
services and costs associated therewith. In its capacity as "partnership
representative," the General Partner shall exercise any and all authority of
the "partnership representative" under the Code, including, without
limitation, (i) binding the Partnership and its Partners with respect to tax
matters and (ii) determining whether to make any available election under
Section 6226 of the Code. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General
Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all things reasonably required
by the General Partner to conduct such proceedings. Each Partner agrees that
notice of or updates regarding tax controversies shall be deemed conclusively
to have been given or made by the General Partner if the Partnership has
either (a) filed the information for which notice is required with the
Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system
and such information is publicly available on such system or (b) made the
information for which notice is required available on any publicly available
website maintained by the Partnership, whether or not such Partner remains a
Partner in the Partnership at the time such information is made publicly
available. The General Partner may amend the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article XIII_ as determined appropriate in order to minimize
the potential U.S.

 



      
 

 



 

federal and state or local income tax consequences to current and former
Limited Partners, and for the proper administration of the Partnership, upon
any amendment to the provisions of Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of Subtitle A of
the Code, as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, or the promulgation
of regulations or publication of other administrative guidance thereunder.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Withholding; Tax Payments_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of
all or less than all of the Partners, either as a distribution of cash to such
Partners or as a general expense of the Partnership, as determined appropriate
under the circumstances by the General Partner.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause the Partnership
and other Group Members to comply with any withholding requirements
established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code or established
under any foreign law. To the extent that the Partnership is required or
elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount resulting
from the allocation or distribution of income to any Partner (including by
reason of Section 1446 of the Code), the General Partner may treat the amount
withheld as a distribution of cash pursuant to _Section 6.3_ or _Section
12.4(c)_ in the amount of such withholding from such Partner.

 



 

 **ARTICLE X.

accordance with _Article IV_ or the acceptance of any Limited Partner
Interests issued pursuant to _Article V_ or pursuant to a merger or
consolidation or conversion pursuant to _Article XIV_, each transferee of, or
other such Person acquiring, a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee
holder or an agent or representative acquiring such Limited Partner Interests
for the account of another Person) (i) shall be admitted to the Partnership as
a Limited Partner with respect to the Limited Partner Interests so transferred
or issued to such Person when any such transfer or admission is reflected in
the books and records of the Partnership and such Limited Partner becomes the
Record Holder of the Limited Partner Interests so transferred, (ii) shall
become bound, and shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound, by the terms of
this Agreement, (iii) represents that the transferee or other recipient has
the capacity, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and (iv) makes
the consents, acknowledgements and waivers contained in this Agreement, all
with or without execution of this Agreement by such Person. The transfer of
any Limited Partner Interests and the admission of any additional or successor
Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this Agreement. A Person
may become a Limited Partner or Record Holder of a Limited Partner Interest
without the consent or approval of any of the Partners. A Person may not
become a Limited Partner without acquiring a Limited Partner Interest and
until such Person is reflected in the books and records of the Partnership as
the Record Holder of such Limited Partner Interest.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The name and mailing address of each Limited Partner shall be listed on
the books and records of the Partnership maintained for such purpose by the
Partnership or the Transfer Agent. The General Partner shall update the books
and records of the Partnership from time to time as necessary to reflect
accurately the information therein (or shall cause the Transfer Agent to do
so, as applicable). A Limited Partner Interest may be represented by a
Certificate, as provided in _Section 4.1_.

 



 

(d) Any transfer of a Limited Partner Interest shall not entitle the
transferee to share in the profits and losses, to receive distributions, to
receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or any similar
item or to any other rights to which the transferor was entitled until the
transferee becomes a Limited Partner pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Admission of Successor General Partner_. A successor General
Partner approved pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ or the
transferee of or successor to all of the General Partner Interest pursuant to
_Section 4.6_ who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner
shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective
immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor or
transferring General Partner, pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _11.2_ or the
transfer of the General Partner Interest pursuant to _Section 4.6_,
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such successor shall be admitted to the
Partnership until compliance with the terms of _Section 4.6_ has occurred and
such successor has executed and delivered such other documents or instruments
as may be required to effect such admission. Any such successor is hereby
authorized to, and shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on the business
of the members of the Partnership Group without dissolution.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_.
To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner
shall take all steps necessary or appropriate under the Delaware Act to amend
the records of the Partnership to reflect such admission and, if necessary, to
prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to this Agreement and, if required
by law, the General Partner shall prepare and file an amendment to the
Certificate of Limited Partnership.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI.

this _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_; or (E) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the
appointment of a trustee (but not a debtor-in-possession), receiver or

properties;

 



 

(v) a final and non-appealable order of relief under Chapter 7 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code is entered by a court with appropriate jurisdiction
pursuant to a voluntary or involuntary petition by or against the General
Partner; or

 



 

(vi) (A) in the event the General Partner is a corporation, a certificate of
dissolution or its equivalent is filed for the General Partner, or 90 days

termination of the General Partner.

 



 

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _(v)_ or
_(vi)(A)_ , _(vi)(B)_ , _(vi)(C)_ or _(vi)(E)_ occurs, the withdrawing
General Partner shall give notice to the Limited Partners within 30 days after
such occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of Withdrawal
described in this _Section 11.1_ shall result in the withdrawal of the
General Partner from the Partnership.

 



 

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
under the following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending at 11:59 p.m., prevailing Central Time, on
December 31, 2022, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at
least 90 daysÂ’ advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited
Partners; _provided_ , that prior to the effective date of such withdrawal,
the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least a majority of the
Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the General Partner
and its Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an
Opinion of Counsel (" ** _Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel_** ") that such
withdrawal (following the selection of the successor General Partner) would
not result in the loss of the limited liability under the Delaware Act of any
Limited Partner or cause any Group Member to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed); (ii) at
any time after 11:59 p.m., prevailing Central Time, on December 31, 2022, the
General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 daysÂ’ advance
notice to the Unitholders, such withdrawal to take effect on the date
specified in such notice; (iii) at any time that the General Partner ceases to
be the General Partner pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ or is removed
pursuant to _Section 11.2_; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at any time that the General
Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 daysÂ’ advance notice of
its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take
effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the time such notice is
given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the
Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership
upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner, manager or managing
member, if any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the
General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(i)_, the holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date
of such withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner who shall be admitted as
a general partner of the Partnership upon the effective date of such
withdrawal. The Person so elected as successor General Partner shall
automatically become the successor general partner, manager or managing
member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the
General Partner is a general partner, manager or a managing member. If, prior
to the effective date of the General PartnerÂ’s withdrawal pursuant to _Section
11.1(a)(i)_, a successor is not selected by the Unitholders as provided herein
or the Partnership does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the
Partnership shall be dissolved in accordance with _Section 12.1_ unless the
business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to _Section 12.2_. Any
successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 11.1_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner_. The General Partner may be
removed if such removal is approved by the Unitholders holding at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Units (excluding Series A Preferred Units, but
including Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates) voting as a
single class. Any such action by such holders for removal of the General
Partner must also provide for the election of a successor General Partner by
the Unitholders holding a majority of the outstanding Common Units, voting as
a class (including, in each case, Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates). Such removal shall be effective immediately following the
admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to _Section 10.2_. The
removal of the General Partner shall also automatically constitute the removal
of the General Partner as general partner, manager or managing member, to the
extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner is
a general partner, manager or a managing member. If a Person is elected as a
successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this _Section
11.2_, such Person shall, upon admission pursuant to _Section 10.2_,
automatically become a successor general partner, manager or managing member,
to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General
Partner is a general partner, manager or a managing member. The right of the
holders of Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall not exist or
be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the
matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.2_ shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

 



 

Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General
Partner_.

 



 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if the successor General Partner is elected in
accordance with the terms of _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, the Departing
General Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date
of the

 



       
 

 



 

withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner, to require its
successor to purchase its General Partner Interest and its or its AffiliatesÂ’
or beneficial ownersÂ’ general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if
any, in the other Group Members (collectively, the " ** _Combined Interest_**
") in exchange for an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such
Combined Interest, such amount to be determined and payable as of the
effective date of its withdrawal or removal. If the General Partner is removed
by the Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General
Partner withdraws under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this
Agreement, and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with
the terms of _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ (or if the business of the
Partnership is continued pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and the successor General
Partner is not the former General Partner), such successor shall have the
option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or removal
of such Departing General Partner (or, in the event the business of the
Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of the Partnership is
continued), to purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of
such Combined Interest. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall
be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing General Partner
pursuant to _Section 7.5_, including any employee-related liabilities
(including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination
of any employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its Affiliates
(other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or the other
Group Members.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 11.3(a)_, the fair market value of the Combined
Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General
Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the
effective date of such Departing General PartnerÂ’s withdrawal or removal, by
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by
the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on
other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such
matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking
firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of
such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General Partner shall designate
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the
Departing General PartnerÂ’s successor shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts
shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or
independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined
Interest. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert shall consider the value of the
Units, including the then current trading price of Units on any National
Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed or admitted to trading, the
value of the PartnershipÂ’s assets, the rights and obligations of the Departing
General Partner (including an appropriate " ** _control premium_** "), the
value of the General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem relevant.

 



 

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
_Section 11.3(a)_, the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall
become a Limited Partner and the Combined Interest shall be converted into
Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or
other independent expert selected pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_, without
reduction in such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution
by reason of the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner
shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as to all
debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which
the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner.
For purposes of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest to Common Units will be
characterized as if the Departing General Partner (or its transferee)
contributed the Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly
issued Common Units.

 



 

Section 11.4 _[Reserved]_.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_. No Limited Partner shall have
any right to withdraw from the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that when
a transferee of a Limited PartnerÂ’s Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record
Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring
Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the
Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII. 
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION**

 



 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the
admission of additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner
is elected pursuant to _Section 11.1_, _11.2_ or _12.2_ , the Partnership
shall not be dissolved and such successor General Partner is hereby authorized
to, and shall, continue the business of the Partnership. Subject to _Section
12.2_, the Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up,
upon:

 



 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in _Section

(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

 



 

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant

Dissolution_.

 



 

Upon (a) an Event of Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the
General Partner as provided in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or (iii) and the failure
of the Partners to select a successor to such Departing General Partner
pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, then within 90 days
thereafter, or (b) an event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, (v) or (vi), then, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, within 180 days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to
continue the business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement by appointing, effective as of the date of the Event
of Withdrawal, as a successor General Partner a Person approved by the holders
of a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the applicable
time period as set forth above, the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If
such an election is so made, then:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier
dissolved in accordance with this _Article XII_;

 



 

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in _Section 11.3_; and

 



 

(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the right of the
holders of a Unit Majority to approve a successor General Partner and to
continue the business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not be
exercised unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that (x)
the exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited liability
under the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the Partnership
nor any Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue (to the extent not
already so treated or taxed).

 



 

Section 12.3 _Liquidator_. Upon dissolution of the Partnership the General
Partner shall select one or more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator
(if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such
compensation for its services as may be approved by holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The Liquidator (if other than the
General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 daysÂ’ prior
notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice of
removal approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common
Units. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor
and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers
and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be
approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units.
The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner
provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or
substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as
expressly provided in this _Article XII_, the Liquidator approved in the
manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further
authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers
conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but
subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon
the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in
_Section 7.4_) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions
of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to
complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for
herein.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_. The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the
assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up
its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the
Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution
in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such
Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the
Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of _Section
12.4(c)_ to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and
contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to
the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of
the PartnershipÂ’s assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an
immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the PartnershipÂ’s assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator
may distribute the PartnershipÂ’s assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners.

 



 

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of _Section
12.3_) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution
rights under _Article VI_. With respect to any liability that is contingent,
conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the
Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be applied as
additional liquidation proceeds.

 



 

(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge
liabilities as provided in _Section 12.4(b)_ shall be distributed to the
Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in
their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all
Capital Account adjustments (including the allocation provided for under
_Section 6.1(d)(xi)(C)_, which allocates items of gross income, gain, loss
and deduction among the Partners to the maximum extent possible to provide a
preference in liquidation to the Capital Account of the Series A Preferred
Units over the Capital Accounts of Series A Junior Securities, but excluding
adjustments made by reason of distributions pursuant to this _Section
12.4(c)_) for the taxable period of the Partnership during which the
liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g));
_provided_ that any cash or cash equivalents available for distribution under
this _Section 12.4(c)_ shall be distributed with respect to the Series A
Preferred Units and Series A Senior Securities (up to the positive balances in
the associated Capital Accounts) prior to any distribution of cash or cash
equivalents with respect to the Series A Junior Securities.

 



 

(d) If the amount the Series A Preferred Unitholders are entitled to receive
with respect to their Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 12.4(c)_
is not equal to the Series A Liquidation Value with respect to such Series A
Preferred Units, then to the extent permitted by law and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, items of gross income
and gain for any preceding taxable period(s) with respect to which IRS Form
1065 Schedules K-1 have not been filed by the Partnership will be reallocated
among the Partners until the Capital Accounts of the Series A Preferred
Unitholders with respect to their Series A Preferred Units are equal to the
Series A Liquidation Value with respect to each such Series A Preferred Unit,
and no other allocation of Profit or Loss pursuant to this Agreement will
reverse the effect of such allocation. In the event the allocations provided
for in this _Section 12.4(d)_ do not result in the Capital Accounts of the
Series A Preferred Unitholders with respect to their Series A Preferred Units
being equal to the aggregate Series A Liquidation Value with respect to such
Series A Preferred Units, the Partnership shall, prior to making the
liquidating distributions pursuant to _Section 12.4(c)_, pay

 



      
 

 



 

each such holder of Series A Preferred Units an amount equal to the excess of
(i) the aggregate Series A Liquidation Value with respect to such Series A
Preferred Units over (ii) the amount to be distributed to such Partner with
respect to its Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 12.4(c)_ and
such payment shall be treated for federal income tax purposes as guaranteed
payments for the use of capital under Section 707(c) of the Code.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_. Upon the
completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in
_Section 12.4_ in connection with the winding up of the Partnership, the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership
as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of
Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

 



 

Section 12.6 _Return of Contributions_. The General Partner shall not be
personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any
monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return
of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any
portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be
made solely from Partnership assets.

 



 

Section 12.7 _Waiver of Partition_. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.

 



 

Section 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration_. No Limited Partner shall have any
obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon
liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to
restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its
interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable period of the
Partnership during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days
after the date of such liquidation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII.

Section 13.1 _Amendments to be Adopted Solely by the General Partner_. Each
Partner agrees that the General Partner, without the approval of any Partner,
subject to _Section 5.12(b)(iii)(B)_, _Section 5.12(b)(iv)_ and _Section
5.13(g)_, may amend any provision of this Agreement and execute, swear to,
acknowledge, deliver, file and record whatever documents may be required in
connection therewith, to reflect:

 



 

(a) a change in the name of the Partnership, the location of the principal
place of business of the Partnership, the registered agent of the Partnership
or the registered office of the Partnership;

 



 

(b) the admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of Partners in
accordance with this Agreement;

 



 

(c) a change that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate to qualify or continue the qualification of the Partnership as a
limited partnership or a partnership in which the Limited Partners have
limited liability under the laws of any state or to ensure that the

 



      
 

 



 

Group Members will not be treated as associations taxable as corporations or
otherwise taxed as entities for federal income tax purposes;

 



 

(d) a change that the General Partner determines (i) does not adversely affect
the Limited Partners considered as a whole (including any particular class of
Partnership Interests as compared to other classes of Partnership Interests)
in any material respect (except as permitted by subsection (g) hereof);
_provided_ , _however_ , for purposes of determining whether an amendment
satisfies the requirements of this _Section 13.1(d)(i)_, the General Partner
shall disregard the effect on any class or classes of Partnership Interests
that have approved such amendment pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_, (ii) to be
necessary or appropriate to (A) satisfy any requirements, conditions or
guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of
any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal
or state statute (including the Delaware Act) or (B) facilitate the trading of
the Units (including the division of any class or classes of Outstanding Units
into different classes to facilitate uniformity of tax consequences within
such classes of Units) or comply with any rule, regulation, guideline or
requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units are or will
be listed or admitted to trading, (iii) to be necessary or appropriate in
connection with action taken by the General Partner pursuant to _Section 5.9_
or (iii) is required to effect the intent expressed in the Registration
Statement or the intent of the provisions of this Agreement or is otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(e) a change in the fiscal year or taxable period of the Partnership and any
other changes that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate as a result of a change in the fiscal year or taxable period of
the Partnership including, if the General Partner shall so determine, a change
in the definition of "Quarter" and the dates on which distributions are to be
made by the Partnership;

 



 

(f) an amendment that is necessary, in the Opinion of Counsel, to prevent the
Partnership, or the General Partner or its directors, officers, trustees or
agents from in any manner being subjected to the provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended, or "plan asset" regulations adopted under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, regardless of whether such are
substantially similar to plan asset regulations currently applied or proposed
by the United States Department of Labor;

 



 

(g) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the creation, authorization or issuance of any
class or series of Partnership Interests or options, rights, warrants,
appreciation rights or phantom or tracking interests relating to the
Partnership Interests pursuant to _Section 5.6_;

 



 

(h) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to be made by the
General Partner acting alone;

 



 

(i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement
approved in accordance with _Section 14.3_;

 



 

(j) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate to reflect and account for the formation by the Partnership of, or
investment by the Partnership in,

 



      
 

 



 

any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or
other entity, in connection with the conduct by the Partnership of activities
permitted by the terms of _Section 2.4_ or _7.1(a)_ ;

 



 

(k) a merger, conveyance or conversion pursuant to _Section 14.3(d)_ or
_Section 14.3(e)_; or

 



 

(l) any other amendments substantially similar to the foregoing.

 

 _ _

 

Section 13.2 _Amendment Procedures_. Amendments to this Agreement may be
proposed only by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose or approve any
amendment to this Agreement and may decline to do so in its sole discretion,
and, in declining to propose or approve an amendment, to the fullest extent
permitted by law shall not be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any
other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any
other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other
law, rule or regulation or at equity. An amendment shall be effective upon its
approval by the General Partner and, except as otherwise provided by _Section
13.1_ or _Section 13.3_, the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a greater or
different percentage is required under this Agreement. Each proposed amendment
that requires the approval of the holders of a specified percentage of
Outstanding Units or class of Limited Partners shall be set forth in a writing
that contains the text of the proposed amendment. If such an amendment is
proposed, the General Partner shall seek the written approval of the requisite
percentage of Outstanding Units or class of Limited Partners or call a meeting
of the Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The
General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any
amendments. The General Partner shall be deemed to have notified all Record
Holders as required by this _Section 13.2_ if it has either (i) filed such
amendment with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval system and such amendment is publicly available on such system or
(ii) made such amendment available on any publicly available website
maintained by the Partnership.

 



 

Section 13.3 _Amendment Requirements_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2,_ no
provision of this Agreement (other than a provision of the Delaware Act that
becomes a part of this Agreement by operation of law) that establishes a
percentage of Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned by the General
Partner) or class of Limited Partners required to take any action shall be
amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would
have the effect of (i) in the case of any provision of this Agreement other
than _Section 11.2_ or _Section 13.4_, reducing such percentage or (ii) in
the case of _Section 11.2_ or _Section 13.4_, increasing such percentage,
unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative
vote of holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units
constitute not less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced or
increased, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_, no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of (including
requiring any holder of a class of Partnership Interests to make additional
Capital Contributions to the Partnership) any Limited Partner without its
consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of an
amendment approved pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_, or (ii) enlarge the
obligations of, restrict, change

 



      
 

 



 

or modify in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce in any way the
amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to, the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which consent may be
given or withheld at its option.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 14.3_ or _Section 13.1_ (this _Section
13.3(c)_ being subject to the General PartnerÂ’s authority to unilaterally
approve amendments pursuant to _Section 13.1_), any amendment that would have
a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any class of
Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of Partnership Interests
must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Partnership Interests of the class affected. If the General Partner determines
an amendment does not satisfy the requirements of _Section 13.1(d)(i)_
because it adversely affects one or more classes of Partnership Interests, as
compared to other classes of Partnership Interests, in any material respect,
such amendment shall only be required to be approved by the adversely affected
class or classes.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to _Section 13.1_ and except as otherwise provided by
_Section 14.3(b)_, no amendments shall become effective without the approval
of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single
class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner
under applicable partnership law of the state under whose laws the Partnership
is organized.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in _Section 13.1_, this _Section 13.3_ shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

 



 

Section 13.4 _Special Meetings_. All acts of Limited Partners to be taken
pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this
_Article XIII_. Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the
General Partner or by Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding
Units of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited
Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner one
or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to
call a special meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes for
which the special meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of
such a call from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be
reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules,
regulations, listing agreements or similar requirements governing the holding
of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the
General Partner shall send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners
either directly or indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be
held at a time and place determined by the General Partner on a date not less
than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting is
given as provided in _Section 16.1_. Limited Partners shall not vote on
matters that would cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part
in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership
so as to jeopardize the Limited PartnersÂ’ limited liability under the Delaware
Act or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do
business.

 



 

Section 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting_. Notice of a meeting called pursuant to
_Section 13.4_ shall be given to the Record Holders of the class or classes
of Units for which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of
written communication in accordance with _Section 16.1_. The

 



      
 

 



 

notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when deposited in the
mail or sent by other means of written communication.

 



 

Section 13.6 _Record Date_. For purposes of determining the Limited Partners
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to
give approvals without a meeting as provided in _Section 13.11_ the General
Partner may set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than
60 days before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts
with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading or U.S. federal
securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of such National Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall
govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the
date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General Partner
to give such approvals. If the General Partner does not set a Record Date,
then (a) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners shall be the close
of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and
(b) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled to give
approvals without a meeting shall be the date the first written approval is
deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner in accordance
with _Section 13.11_.

 



 

Section 13.7 _Adjournment_. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or
place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date
need not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more
than 45 days. At the adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in
accordance with this _Article XIII_.

 



 

Section 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes_. The
transactions at any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed,
and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly
held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or
by proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any
right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be included in
the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is
expressly made at the meeting.

 



 

Section 13.9 _Quorum and Voting_. The holders of a majority of the Outstanding
Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner or its Affiliates)
represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the
Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such
Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any
meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this
Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the
Outstanding Units entitled to vote and be present in person or by proxy at
such meeting shall be deemed to

 



       
 

 



 

constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different
percentage or class vote is required with respect to such action under the
provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such
greater or different percentage or the act of the Limited Partners holding the
requisite percentage of the necessary class, shall be required. The Limited
Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present
may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage
of Outstanding Units or class of Limited Partners specified in this Agreement
(including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner or its
Affiliates). In the absence of a quorum any meeting of Limited Partners may be
adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least a
majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote at such meeting (including
Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented either in
person or by proxy, but no other business may be transacted, except as
provided in _Section 13.7_.

 



 

Section 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting_. The General Partner shall have full
power and authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the
Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the
determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the
satisfaction of the requirements of _Section 13.4_, the conduct of voting,
the validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any
controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the
meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a Person to serve as
chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the
minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the records of the
Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General Partner may make
such other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it
may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited
Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in
regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors
of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other
evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of approvals in writing.

 



 

Section 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting_. If authorized by the General
Partner, any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may
be taken without a meeting, without a vote and without prior notice, if an
approval in writing or by electronic transmission is signed or transmitted by
Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of the
Outstanding Units (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General
Partner or its Affiliates) that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners entitled to vote thereon
were present and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which case the rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange
shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall
be given to the Limited Partners who have not approved in writing. The General
Partner may specify that any written ballot, if any, submitted to Limited
Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be
returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less
than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the
Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the
Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Units
that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the Limited
Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the

 



      
 

 



 

General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless
and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General
Partner and (b) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to
the effect that the exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken
with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners
to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business
and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited PartnersÂ’
limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes
then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the
Partners. Nothing contained in this _Article XIII_ shall be deemed to require
the General Partner to solicit all Limited Partners in connection with a
matter approved by the holders of the requisite percentage of Units acting by
written consent without a meeting.

 



 

Section 13.12 _Right to Vote and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set
pursuant to _Section 13.6_ (and also subject to the limitations contained in
the definition of " ** _Outstanding_** ") shall be entitled to notice of, and
to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as
to which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to
act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be
taken by, the Outstanding Units or the holders thereof shall be deemed to be
references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding
Units.

 



 

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a PersonÂ’s account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation,
or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered,
such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such
Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person
who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume
it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this _Section
13.12(b)_ (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to
the provisions of _Section 4.3_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIV. 
MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR CONVERSION**

 



 

Section 14.1 _Authority_. The Partnership may merge or consolidate with or
into one or more corporations, limited liability companies, statutory trusts,
business trusts, associations, real estate investment trusts, common law
trusts or unincorporated businesses or entities, including a partnership
(whether general or limited (including a limited liability partnership or a
limited liability limited partnership)) (each an " ** _Other Entity_** ") or
convert into any such Other Entity, whether such Other Entity is formed under
the laws of the State of Delaware or any other state of the United States of
America, pursuant to a written plan of merger or consolidation (" ** _Merger
Agreement_** ") or a written plan of conversion (" ** _Plan of Conversion_**
"), as the case may be, in accordance with this _Article XIV_.

 



 

Section 14.2 _Procedure for Merger, Consolidation or Conversion_.

 



 

(a) Merger, consolidation or conversion of the Partnership pursuant to this
_Article XIV_ requires the prior consent of the General Partner, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, to the fullest extent

 



      
 

 



 

permitted by law, the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to
consent to any merger, consolidation or conversion of the Partnership and may
decline to do so free of any fiduciary duty or obligation whatsoever to the
Partnership, any Limited Partner and, in declining to consent to a merger,
consolidation or conversion, shall not be required to act in good faith or

effect any amendment to this Agreement or (b) effect the adoption of a new
partnership agreement for the Partnership if it is the Surviving Business
Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made pursuant to this _Section 14.3_
shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
consolidation.

required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of a Merger
Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, a certificate of

(b) At the effective time of the certificate of conversion, for all purposes
of the laws of the State of Delaware:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue to exist, without interruption, but in the

organizational form;

 



 

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall remain vested in the converted entity in its
new organizational form without reversion or impairment, without further act
or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but subject

 **ARTICLE XV. 
RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 15.1 _Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except _Section
5.12(b)(vii)_, if at any time the General Partner and its Affiliates hold more
than 80% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding,
the General Partner shall then have the right, which right it may assign and
transfer in whole or in part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the
General Partner, exercisable in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not
less than all, of such Limited Partner Interests (but excluding the Series A
Preferred Units, which are subject to _Section 5.12(b)(vii)_) of such class
then Outstanding held by Persons other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of the date
three days prior to the date that the notice described in _Section 15.1(b)_
is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such class purchased
during the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice described in
_Section 15.1(b)_ is mailed.

 



 

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to _Section 15.1(a)_, the General Partner shall deliver to
the Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the " ** _Notice of
Election to Purchase_** ") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy
of such Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited
Partner Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the General
Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase Date.
Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for a period of at
least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general
circulation printed in the English language and published in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the
Purchase Date and the price (determined in accordance with _Section 15.1(a)_)
at which Limited Partner Interests will be purchased and state that the
General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects
to purchase such Limited Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates
representing such Limited Partner Interests in the case of Limited Partner
Interests evidenced by Certificates, in exchange for payment, at such office
or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may
be required by any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner
Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election to
Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his address
as reflected in the records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively
presumed to have been given regardless of whether the owner receives such
notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate
or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of
such Limited Partner Interests to be purchased in accordance with this
_Section 15.1_. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly
given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or
prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding

 



      
 

 



 

sentence has been made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner
Interests subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the
Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered for purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner
Interests (including any rights pursuant to _Article III_, _Article IV_,
_Article V_, _Article VI_ and _Article XII_) shall thereupon cease, except
the right to receive the purchase price (determined in accordance with
_Section 15.1(a)_) for Limited Partner Interests therefor, without interest,
upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates representing such
Limited Partner Interests in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced
by Certificates, and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed
to be transferred to the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as
the case may be, on the record books of the Transfer Agent and the
Partnership, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner,
or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be the owner of all
such Limited Partner Interests from and after the Purchase Date and shall have
all rights as the owner of such Limited Partner Interests (including all
rights as owner of such Limited Partner Interests pursuant to _Article III_,
_Article IV_, _Article V_, _Article VI_ and _Article XII_).

 



 

(c) In the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any
time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited
Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this _Section 15.1_ may
surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in _Section
15.1(a)_, therefor, without interest thereon.

Section 16.7 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Each Partner agrees that (a) any
Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert rights and remedies hereunder as a
third-party beneficiary hereto with respect to those provisions of this

Person acquiring a Limited Partner Interest, pursuant to _Sections 10.1(a)_

 ** _FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT_**

 



 

[See attached]

 



      
 

 



 

 **FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Transition Services Agreement (this " ** _Agreement_** "), dated as of [
] (the " ** _Effective Date_** "), is by and among USA Compression Partners,
LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" ** _USAC_** "), CDM Resource Management
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" ** _CDM Resource_** "), and CDM
Environmental and Technical Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(" ** _CDM Environmental_** " and, together with CDM Resource, the " **
_Compression Group Entities_** " and, each, a " ** _Compression Group
Entity_** ") and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" ** _ETP_** "). USAC, the Compression Group Entities and ETP are
sometimes referred to individually as a " ** _Party_** " and collectively as
the " ** _Parties_**."

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** ETP, Energy Transfer Partners GP, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership, ETC Compression, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, USAC,
and solely for purposes of 5.18(b), Section 10.1 and Section 10.5 therein,
Energy Transfer Equity, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership entered into a
Contribution Agreement dated January 15, 2018 (the " ** _Contribution
Agreement_** ") and agreed as a condition of the Closing of the transactions
contemplated thereby to enter into a transition services agreement in a form
mutually agreeable to such parties; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** ETP desires to provide certain transition services to USAC and
its Affiliates (as defined herein) and USAC desires to accept such services on
the terms set forth herein.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the premises and the mutual
agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
SERVICES**

 



 

Section 1.1 **Services to be Provided to USAC.**

 



 

(a) ETP shall provide to USAC and its Affiliates the services set forth on
_Schedule 1.1_ (the " ** _Services_** "), as may be requested by USAC from
time to time. If, after the date hereof, USAC desires to amend _Schedule 1.1_
to provide for the provision of additional Services, _Schedule 1.1_ may be
amended by mutual agreement of the Parties and, in such instance, ETP shall
provide such additional services as part of the Services. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Affiliate" shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other
Person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Person in
question. As used herein, the term "control" (including, with correlative
meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") means the
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of the management and policies of a Person, whether through ownership of
voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of this Agreement, USAC, on the one hand, and ETP, on the other,
shall not be considered Affiliates.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Operational Support Employee who performs Services hereunder (each a
" ** _Service Employee_** ") shall be solely employed by ETP or an Affiliate
thereof during the period that he or she performs Services, and with respect
to such employment during such period, ETP (or such Affiliate) shall be solely
responsible, and shall satisfy all obligations, with respect to each Service
Employee for: payment of all wages and other compensation, provision of all
leaves and benefits, satisfaction of all labor, employment and employee
benefits laws, maintenance of all health and welfare insurance (including
workersÂ’ compensation insurance), recordkeeping obligations, immigration
compliance, and payroll taxes and tax withholdings, in each case, during the
period that such Service Employee performs Services. USAC and its Affiliates
shall have no right or authority to terminate any Service EmployeeÂ’s
employment with ETP (or an Affiliate thereof) during the term of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) In providing the Services, ETP shall comply with all applicable Laws and
shall ensure that all Service Employees have all required licenses and
certifications, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure all
Service Employees have all required training. ETP shall perform the Services
with the same quality of workmanship, professionalism and standards, as such
services were performed by ETP and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Date, in all material respects.

 



 

Section 1.2 **Service Coordinators.** ETP and USAC shall each nominate a
representative to act as the primary contact person for such entity (each, a "
** _Service Coordinator_** " and collectively, the " ** _Service
Coordinators_** ") with respect to the performance and receipt of the
Services. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, all communications
relating to this Agreement and to the Services provided hereunder (other than
day-to-day communications and billings relating to the actual provision of the
Services) shall be directed to the Service Coordinators. The initial Service
Coordinators and their contact information is set forth on _Schedule 1.2_.
ETP and USAC may each replace its respective Service Coordinator at any time
by providing notice in accordance with _Section 7.2_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.3 **Cooperation.** Each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate reasonably with the other Parties in all matters relating
to the provision and receipt of the Services and to minimize the expense,
distraction and disturbance to each Party.

 



 

Section 1.4 **Resources.** Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, ETP shall be responsible for providing the facilities, personnel,
software, equipment, and other resources necessary to provide the Services.

 



 

Section 1.5 **Data Security.** The Parties will work together to implement a
mutually agreeable means for access to one anotherÂ’s operating environment as
necessary to provide the Services in a manner that is not detrimental to any
PartyÂ’s network security or operating environment.

 



 

Section 1.6 **Data; Intellectual Property.**

 



 

(a) All USAC Data is, or upon creation will be, and shall remain the property
of USAC or its applicable Affiliate. ETP hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers
and conveys, and shall cause ETPÂ’s Affiliates and subcontractors to assign,
transfer and convey, to USAC or its

 



      
 

 



 

designee without further consideration all of its and their rights, title and
interest in, to and under USAC Data created as part of the Services. For
purposes of this Agreement, " ** _USAC Data_**" shall mean all data that (i)
is or has been obtained, developed or produced by ETP or ETPÂ’s Affiliates or
subcontractors in connection with the provision of the Services and relates to
USAC or its Affiliates or (ii) relates to USAC or its Affiliates to which ETP
or ETPÂ’s Affiliates or subcontractors have access in connection with the
provision of the Services.

 



 

(b) All Intellectual Property (i) created, conceived or developed in whole or
in part by ETP or ETPÂ’s Affiliates or subcontractors in connection with the
Services and (ii) based on, derivative of, or created, conceived or developed
as a result of access to any assets of USAC or its Affiliates, will be the
property of USAC or its applicable Affiliate (" ** _Services IP_** "). ETP
hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers and conveys, and shall cause ETPÂ’s
Affiliates and subcontractors to assign, transfer and convey, to USAC or its
designee without further consideration all of its and their rights, title and
interest in, to and under Services IP created, conceived or developed as part
of the Services.

 



 

Section 1.7 **Discontinuation of Services.** At any time during the Transition
Services Period (as defined below), USAC may, in its sole discretion, without
cause and in accordance with the terms and conditions hereunder, request the
discontinuation of one or more specific Services by providing written notice
to ETP at least five (5) Business Days in advance of the date upon which such
discontinuation is intended to take effect. For the avoidance of doubt, such
request may include a request by USAC for the discontinuation of services
provided by one or more Service Employees.

 



 

Section 1.8 **Employment Offers.** USA Compression Management Services, LLC ("
** _USAC Management_** "), in its sole discretion, may make offers of
employment at any time following the Effective Date through the expiration of
the Transition Services Period to those Service Employees of their choosing.
For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise extended by the Parties and
agreed to in writing, the " ** _Transition Services Period_** " shall mean the
period commencing on the Effective Date up to and including the date that is
ninety (90) days following the Effective Date. ETP and USAC shall reasonably
cooperate to permit USAC Management to make offers of employment to any
Service Employees prior to the expiration of the Transition Services Period,
which cooperation shall include, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
allowing reasonable access to any Service Employees during normal business
hours in order to conduct screening and interviews in connection with
employment offer determinations. ETP shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates
not to) take any action (or omit to take any action) with the intent to
directly or indirectly discourage any Service Employee from accepting any
offer of employment made pursuant to this _Section 1.8_. The Parties
acknowledge that the acceptance of employment offers, if any, made by USAC
Management to a Service Employee is solely at the discretion of the individual
Service Employee to whom offers of employment may be made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II** ** 
LIMITATIONS**

 



 

Section 2.1 **Force Majeure.** The Parties shall not have any liability or
responsibility, and shall be excused from performance for, any interruption,
delay, impairment or other failure

 



      
 

 



 

to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement to the extent and so long as
the fulfillment of such obligation is interrupted, delayed, impaired,
prevented or frustrated as a result of or by natural disaster, hurricane,
earthquake, floods, fire, catastrophic weather conditions, diseases or other
elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war (declared or undeclared),
insurrection, riot, embargoes, or terrorist acts (" ** _Force Majeure Event_**
"). A Party impacted by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other
Parties of its delay in performance, describing in reasonable detail the
circumstances causing such delay, and shall resume the performance of its
obligations as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 



 

Section 2.2 **Interim Basis Only.** Each Party acknowledges that the purpose
of this Agreement is for ETP to provide USAC and its Affiliates with Services
on an interim basis. Accordingly, at all times from and after the Effective
Date, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
approvals, permits or licenses, implement any computer systems and take, or
cause to be taken, any and all other actions necessary or advisable for USAC
or its designated Affiliate to provide such Services, as applicable, for
itself upon the date that Services are no longer provided hereunder.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** ** 
PAYMENT**

 



 

Section 3.1 **Fees.** In consideration for the applicable Services, USAC shall
pay to ETP the fees set forth below (the " ** _Fees_** "):

 



 

(a) reimbursement or payment for all costs and expenses incurred by ETP or its
Affiliates with respect to the Service Employees for those hours actually
worked by the Service Employees in performing the Services; and

 



 

(b) any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by ETP with
respect to each Service EmployeeÂ’s performance of Services;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each Service Employee, no
amount accrued following the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Transition
Services Period applicable to the Services performed by such Service Employee;
(ii) the date that the Services related to such Service Employee are
discontinued pursuant to _Section 1.7_; or (iii) the date that a Service
EmployeeÂ’s employment or service relationship with ETP terminates, shall be a
Fee.

 



 

Section 3.2 **Billing and Payment Terms.**

 



 

(a) ETP shall invoice USAC within thirty (30) days after the end of each
calendar month (such invoice to set forth a description of the Services
provided and reasonable documentation to support the charges thereon) during
which Services have been provided hereunder for the Fees for all Services that
ETP delivered during the preceding month. All undisputed Fees associated with
such invoice shall be payable within thirty (30) days after USACÂ’s receipt of
the invoice.

 



 

(b) In the event of a good-faith dispute as to the amount of any invoice or
portion thereof submitted by ETP to USAC, USAC will pay all undisputed charges
on such invoice in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.2(a)_ above,
and will provide written

 



      
 

 



 

notice to ETP within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice regarding the
disputed amount and the reasons each such charge is disputed. ETP shall
promptly provide USAC with sufficient records relating to the disputed charge
so as to enable the Parties to resolve the dispute. If the Parties fail to
agree as to the amount or propriety of any invoice or any portions thereof
within fifteen (15) days after USACÂ’s receipt of ETPÂ’s supporting
documentation, then either Party may pursue dispute resolution in accordance
with _Section 7.9_ of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.3 **Sales Taxes.** All consideration under this Agreement is
exclusive of any sales, transfer, value-added, goods or services tax or
similar gross receipts based tax (including any such taxes that are required
to be collected or withheld, but excluding all other taxes including taxes
based upon or calculated by reference to income, receipts or capital) imposed
against or on Services provided (" ** _Sales Taxes_** ") by ETP and such Sales
Taxes will be added to the consideration where applicable. Such Sales Taxes
shall be separately stated on the relevant invoice. All taxable goods and
Services for which USAC is compensating or reimbursing ETP shall be set out
separately from non-taxable goods and Services, if practicable. USAC shall be
responsible for any such Sales Taxes and shall either (a) remit such Sales
Taxes to ETP (and ETP shall remit such amounts to the applicable taxing
authority) or (b) provide ETP with a certificate or other acceptable proof
evidencing an exemption from liability for such Sales Taxes.

 



 

Section 3.4 **Reconciliation of Net Cash.** Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary, the cost (including any component of Fees) of any Service
provided by ETP to USAC and its Affiliates that has been taken into account in
the calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement shall not constitute Fees that ETP is entitled to
receive under this Agreement and shall not otherwise be payable or
reimbursable by USAC or its Affiliates.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV** ** 
CONFIDENTIALITY**

 



 

Section 4.1 **Confidentiality.** Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and any information provided by one
Party (or any Person providing or receiving Services on such PartyÂ’s behalf)
to the other Party (or any Person providing or receiving Services on such
PartyÂ’s behalf) in connection with the provision or receipt of the Services
shall constitute Confidential Information. Each Party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates and subcontractors to, maintain in confidence and not disclose
to any Person, other than its representatives and advisors, nor use, other
than in the provision of the Services, any Confidential Information or any
non-public information relating to the other Party or its Affiliates provided
in connection herewith, except as and to the extent required by Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V** ** 
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; INDEMNITY**

 



 

Section 5.1 **Disclaimer of Warranties.** EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY
AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING WARRANTIES WITH

 



      
 

 



 

RESPECT TO MERCHANTABILITY, OR SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE PROVIDED
HEREUNDER, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF
PERFORMANCE OR TRADE USAGE. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO LIMIT ANY
RIGHTS OR REMEDIES OF EITHER PARTY UNDER THE CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 5.2 **Indemnity.**

 



 

(a) USAC hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ETP, its
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, owners, managers,
members, employees, controlling persons, agents, representatives, contractors,
subcontractors, successors and assigns (collectively, " ** _ETP Indemnified
Persons_** ") from and against any and all Losses incurred by any ETP
Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from (i) the negligence or the
intentional or willful misconduct of any of USAC Indemnified Persons (as
defined below) or (ii) the breach of this Agreement by USAC Indemnified
Persons, in each case, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE THE RESULT OF OR
CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT OF ANY OF ETP INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, _EXCEPT_ TO THE EXTENT SUCH LOSSES
RESULT FROM (X) THE NEGLIGENCE OR THE INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
OF ETP INDEMNIFIED PERSONS OR (Y) THE BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY ANY ETP
INDEMNIFIED PERSON. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any ETP Indemnified Person
entitled to receive indemnification under this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall act in
good faith and use its reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses
for which it seeks indemnification, including making a good faith effort to
recover from insurers under applicable insurance policies and from other
persons who may be liable so as to reduce the amount of any Losses hereunder.
If the amount of any Losses at any time subsequent to the making of an
indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or
otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other person, the
amount of such reduction, less any costs, or expenses incurred in connection
therewith, will promptly be repaid by the ETP Indemnified Persons to USAC.

 



 

(b) ETP agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless USAC, its Affiliates and
its and their respective directors, officers, owners, managers, members,
employees, controlling persons, agents, representatives, contractors,
subcontractors, successors and assigns (collectively, " ** _USAC Indemnified

ETP, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained herein may be waived only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound by such waiver, but such

the Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.

* ETP or an Affiliate thereof will continue to employ and manage all day-to-day activities of all Service Employees from the Closing Date through the Transition Services Period, or, if earlier, with respect to an individual Service Employee, until the date (if any) such Service Employee commences employment as a Transferred Employee (the " ** _Post-Closing Employment Period_** "). Cash compensation (including, without limitation, base salaries, hourly wages, overtime pay, cash bonus or incentive compensation, severance or termination pay, and reimbursements for business expenses or travel, including all payroll and employment taxes associated therewith) and employee benefits for the Service Employees will be paid or provided by ETP (or an Affiliate thereof) in accordance with the compensation structure and policies as in place from time to time. ETP or its Affiliates shall process all payroll items for the Service Employees (including withholding, tax filing and payments, reconciling payroll ledgers, and check distributions or direct deposits) and shall coordinate services with all applicable health and welfare benefit providers.

 



 

* During the Transition Services Period, ETP shall not transfer any Service Employees to any other position within ETPÂ’s organization or to any of its Affiliates (other than with USACÂ’s prior consent) and shall take no action that adversely interferes with the performance of services by the Service Employees as contemplated herein, provided, however, that ETP may transfer any Service Employee with respect to whom USAC has informed ETP of its decision not to extend an offer of employment. ETP shall not employ or engage any additional employees or consultants to perform the services intended to be performed by the Service Employees hereunder unless such individuals are intended to replace the services or duties previously provided by a terminated Service Employee.

(a) At the option and upon the written request (the " ** _Registration
Request_**") of a Holder (any such Holder, a " ** _Demanding Holder_**") the
Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a
Registration Statement to permit the public resale of the Registrable Units of

Securities Act (a " ** _Shelf Registration Statement_** ") in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Partnership shall only
be obligated to prepare and file such Shelf Registration Statement (i) with
respect to any request by the Energy Transfer Parties, if the amount of
Registrable Units to be registered for resale by the Energy Transfer Parties
is greater than or equal to at least five percent (5%) of the then outstanding
Registrable Units beneficially owned by the Energy Transfer Parties, (ii) with
respect to any request by the Energy Transfer Parties, if the request is made
after the expiration of the Holding Period and (iii) if the request is made
after the expiration of any applicable lock-up period imposed by the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 2.07_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Partnership shall not be required to effect more than (A) three (3)
Registrations pursuant to this _Section 2.01_ on behalf of ETE; and (B) three
(3) Registrations pursuant to this _Section 2.01_ on behalf of ETP. Within
five (5) Business Days of receipt of a Registration Request, the Partnership
shall give written notice to each other Holder regarding such proposed
Registration, and such notice shall offer such other Holders the opportunity
to include in the Registration such number of Registrable Units as each such
Holder may request. Each such Holder shall make its request in writing to the
Partnership within three

 



      
 

 



 

(3) Business Days after the receipt of any such notice from the Partnership,
which request shall specify the number of Registrable Units intended to be
disposed of by such Holder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Energy Transfer
Parties shall not be entitled to be Demanding Holders until the expiration of
the Holding Period.

 



 

(b) In connection with an underwritten offering of Registrable Units pursuant
to this _Section 2.01_, the Demanding Holders shall have the right to select
the managing underwriter or underwriters to lead the offering, subject to the
PartnershipÂ’s consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Partnership shall not be required to effect more than (i) two (2) underwritten
offerings of Registrable Units in any 360-day period on behalf of ETE and ETP
and (ii) two (2) underwritten offerings of Registrable Units in any 360-day
period on behalf of USAC Holdings; _provided, however_ , that if any Series A
Preferred Holder is conducting or actively pursuing an underwritten offering
pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Series A Preferred Registration Rights
Agreement on any date after three years from the date hereof, then the
Partnership may suspend any right of USAC Holdings, the Energy Transfer
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates to require the Partnership to
conduct an underwritten offering on their behalf pursuant to this _Section
2.01_, except that the Partnership may only suspend the right of USAC Holdings
or the Energy Transfer Parties to require the Partnership to conduct an
underwritten offering pursuant to this _Section 2.01_ once in any six-month
period and in no event for a period that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in
any 180-day period or 90 days in any 365-day period. If the Partnership, USAC
Holdings, the Energy Transfer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates is
conducting or actively pursuing a securities offering of USAC Common Units
with anticipated gross offering proceeds of at least $50 million (other than
in connection with any at-the-market offering or similar continuous offering
program), then the Partnership may suspend any Series A Preferred HolderÂ’s
right to require the Partnership to conduct an underwritten offering pursuant
to Section 2.03 of the Series A Preferred Registration Rights Agreement on
such Series A Preferred HolderÂ’s behalf pursuant thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership may only suspend such Series A Preferred
HolderÂ’s right to require the Partnership to conduct an underwritten offering
pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Series A Preferred Registration Rights
Agreement once in any six-month period and in no event for a period that
exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day period or 90 days in any
365-day period.

 



 

(c) In connection with an underwritten offering of Registrable Units pursuant
to this _Section 2.01_, if the managing underwriter(s) advise the Partnership
that in their opinion the number of USAC Common Units proposed to be included
in such offering exceeds the number of USAC Common Units that can be sold in
such offering without being likely to materially delay or jeopardize the
success or timing of the offering (including the price per unit of the USAC
Common Units proposed to be sold in such offering), the Partnership shall
include in such Registration and offering:

 



 

(i) With respect to any underwritten offering occurring (i) prior to the
expiration of the Holding Period, (ii) after the expiration of the Holding
Period but prior to eighteen months from the Closing Date, (iii) after
eighteen months from the Closing Date but prior to the two-year anniversary of
the Closing Date and USAC Holdings beneficially owns less than 1,000,000
Registrable Units or (iv) on any date following the two-year anniversary of
the Closing Date, then in the case of clause (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv),

to sell and (B) second, the number of USAC Common Units requested to be
included therein by other Holders that have elected to include Registrable
Units in such underwritten offering pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, pro rata
among all such unitholders on the basis of the number of USAC Common Units
requested to be included therein by all such unitholders or as such
unitholders may otherwise agree. If the number of USAC Common Units that can
be sold is less than the number of USAC Common Units proposed to be sold by
the Demanding Holder, the amount of USAC Common Units to be sold shall be
fully allocated to the Demanding Holder.

 



 

(ii) With respect to any underwritten offering occurring after the expiration
of the Holding Period but prior to the two-year anniversary of the Closing
Date and so long as USAC Holdings beneficially owns at least 1,000,000
Registrable Units, the amount of USAC Common Units to be sold shall be
allocated such that USAC Holdings and the Energy Transfer Parties each receive
50% of the net proceeds from the sale.

 



 

(d) In connection with any Registrable Units offered pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement under this _Section 2.01_, the Holders shall provide
the Partnership with not less than three (3) Business DaysÂ’ notice before
selling or disposing of any such Registrable Units.

 



 

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(a) Commencing on the expiration of the Holding Period (or, in the case of
USAC Holdings only, on the date hereof), if the Partnership proposes to file
with the SEC (i) a Registration Statement to register any USAC Common Units
for an underwritten offering under the Securities Act or (ii) a prospectus
supplement relating to the sale of USAC Common Units pursuant to an effective
"automatic" registration statement, so long as the Partnership is a WKSI at
such time or, whether or not the Partnership is a WKSI, so long as the
Registrable Units were previously included in the underlying shelf
Registration Statement or are included on an effective Registration Statement,
in each case for its own account and/or for another Person (except during the
period from the date hereof until two years thereafter, for any Series A
Preferred Holder) (such other Person, an " ** _Other Holder_** "), other than
on a registration statement on Form S-8 or Form S-4, and the form of
registration statement to be used may be used for a registration of
Registrable Units (a " ** _Piggyback Registration_** "), the Partnership shall
give five (5) Business DaysÂ’ written notice to the Holders of its intention to
file such registration statement and, subject to this _Section 2.02_, shall
include in such Registration Statement and in any offering of USAC Common
Units to be made pursuant to that Registration Statement all Registrable Units
with respect to which the Partnership has received a written request for
inclusion therein from any Holder within three (3) Business Days after such
HolderÂ’s receipt of the PartnershipÂ’s notice ( _provided_ , that only
Registrable Units of the same class or classes as the USAC Common Units being
registered may be included). The Partnership shall have no obligation to
proceed with any Piggyback Registration and may abandon, terminate and/or
withdraw such registration for any reason at any time prior to the pricing
thereof. Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw such HolderÂ’s request for
inclusion of such HolderÂ’s Registrable Units in such Piggyback Registration by
giving written notice to the Partnership of such withdrawal at least

 



      
 

 



 

two (2) Business Days prior to the time of the public announcement of the
PartnershipÂ’s intention to conduct such underwritten offering.

 



 

(b) If a Piggyback Registration is initiated for an underwritten offering on
behalf of the Partnership or any Other Holder and the managing underwriter(s)
advise the Partnership that in their opinion the number of USAC Common Units
proposed to be included in such offering exceeds the number of USAC Common
Units that can be sold in such offering without being likely to materially
delay or jeopardize the success or timing of the offering (including the price
per unit of the USAC Common Units proposed to be sold in such offering), the
Partnership shall include in such registration and offering (i) first, the
number of USAC Common Units that the Partnership or, if such offering was
initiated by any Other Holder, any Other Holder proposes to sell and (ii)
second, the number of USAC Common Units requested to be included therein by
the Holders and by any Series A Preferred Holder pursuant to the Series A
Preferred Registration Rights Agreement that have elected to include
Registrable Units in such Piggyback Registration, pro rata among all such
Holders and Series A Preferred Holders on the basis of the number of USAC
Common Units requested to be included therein by all such Holders and Series A
Preferred Holders or as such Holders, Series A Preferred Holders and the
Partnership may otherwise agree and (iii) third, the number of USAC Common
Units requested to be included therein by other unitholders of USAC, pro rata
among all such unitholders on the basis of the number of USAC Common Units
requested to be included therein by all such unitholders or as such
unitholders and the Partnership may otherwise agree. If the number of USAC
Common Units that can be so sold is less than the number of USAC Common Units
proposed to be sold by the Partnership or any Other Holder pursuant to the
Piggyback Registration, the amount of USAC Common Units to be sold shall be
fully allocated to the Partnership or such Other Holder, as applicable.

 



 

(c) In any Piggyback Registration under _Section 2.02(b)_, the Partnership
shall have the right to select the underwriter or underwriters for any
offering conducted pursuant thereto.

 



 

(d) None of the Holders shall sell any Registrable Units in any offering
pursuant to a Piggyback Registration unless it (i) agrees to sell such
Registrable Units on the basis provided in the underwriting arrangements
approved by the Partnership and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements,
lockups and other documents reasonably required of such Holder under the terms
of such arrangements.

 



 

Section 2.03 _Suspension Periods_. The Partnership may delay the filing or
effectiveness of, or by written notice to the Holders suspend the use of, a
Shelf Registration Statement in conjunction with a registration of Registrable
Units pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (and, if reasonably required, withdraw any
Shelf Registration Statement that has been filed), but in each such case only
if USAC GP determines in good faith that (a) such delay would enable the
Partnership to avoid disclosure of material information, the disclosure of
which at that time would be adverse to the Partnership (including by
interfering with, or jeopardizing the success of, any pending or proposed
acquisition, disposition or reorganization), (b) such filing or use would
render the Partnership unable to comply with applicable securities Laws or (c)
obtaining any financial statements (including required consents) required to
be included in any such Shelf Registration Statement (or incorporated therein)
would be impracticable. Any period during which the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership has delayed the filing, effectiveness or use of a Registration

Period_** _._ " In no event shall the number of days covered by (i) any one

suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose, and (C) the receipt by the Partnership of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Units for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky laws of
any jurisdiction. The Partnership agrees to as promptly as practicable amend
or supplement the Prospectus or take other appropriate action so that the
Prospectus does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then
existing and to take such other action as is necessary to remove a stop order,
suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

 



       
 

 



 

(viii) upon request, furnish to each selling Holder, subject to appropriate
confidentiality obligations, copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the SEC or any other governmental agency or self-
regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic or
foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable Units;

 



 

(ix) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders,
as promptly as practicable, an earnings statement, which earnings statement
shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 promulgated thereunder;

 



 

(x) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Units to be
registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities
as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the
Partnership to enable the selling Holders to consummate the disposition of
such Registrable Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall
not be required to qualify or register as a foreign corporation or to take any
action that would subject it to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or registered or where it
would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation;

 



 

(xi) in the case of an underwritten offering requested pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)_, enter into an underwriting agreement containing such provisions
(including provisions for indemnification, lockups, opinions of counsel and
comfort letters) as are customary and reasonable for an offering of such kind;

 



 

(xii) in the case of an underwritten offering requested pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)_, use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the PartnershipÂ’s
independent accountants to provide customary "cold comfort" letters to the
managing underwriter(s) of such offering in connection therewith and (B) cause
the PartnershipÂ’s counsel to furnish customary legal opinions to such
underwriters in connection therewith; and

 



 

(xiii) use reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Units to be
listed on each National Securities Exchange on which securities of the same
class issued by the Partnership are then listed.

 



 

(b) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Partnership to
take any action pursuant to this Agreement that the Holders shall furnish to
the Partnership such information regarding itself, the Registrable Units held
by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as the
Partnership shall reasonably request and as shall be required in connection
with the action to be taken by the Partnership.

 



 

(c) The Holders agree by having their USAC Common Units treated as Registrable
Units hereunder that, upon being advised in writing by the Partnership of the
occurrence of an event pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)(vii)_ when the
Partnership is entitled to do so pursuant to _Section 2.03_, the Holders will
immediately discontinue (and direct any other Persons making offers and sales
of Registrable Units to immediately discontinue) offers and sales of
Registrable Units pursuant to any Registration Statement until it is advised
in writing by the Partnership that

 



      
 

 



 

the use of the Prospectus may be resumed and is furnished with a supplemented
or amended Prospectus as contemplated by _Section 2.04(a)(vii)_, and, if so
directed by the Partnership, the Holders will deliver to the Partnership all
copies, other than permanent file copies then in the HoldersÂ’ possession, of
the Prospectus covering such Registrable Units current at the time of receipt
of such notice.

 



 

(d) The Partnership may prepare and deliver an issuer free writing prospectus
(as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in lieu of any
supplement to a Prospectus, and references herein to any "supplement" to a
Prospectus shall include any such issuer free writing prospectus. No seller of
Registrable Units may use a free writing prospectus to offer or sell any such
units without the PartnershipÂ’s prior written consent.

 



 

(e) It is understood and agreed that the Partnership shall not have any
obligations under this _Article II_ at any time following the termination of
this Agreement, unless an underwritten offering in which any Holder
participates has been priced, but not completed, prior to the applicable date
of such termination, in which event the PartnershipÂ’s obligations under this
_Section 2.04_ shall continue with respect to such offering until it is so
completed.

 



 

(f) If a Registration Statement required by _Section 2.01_ does not become or
is not declared effective within 180 days after the date it is filed with the
SEC (the " ** _Filing Date_** "), then the Holders requesting such
registration shall be entitled to a payment (with respect to each Registrable
Unit held by such Holders), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of
0.25% per annum of the Issue Price for each 30-day period immediately
following the 180th day after the Filing Date (the " ** _Liquidated Damages_**
"), until such time as such Registration Statement becomes effective or is
declared effective or the Registrable Units covered by such Registration
Statement are no longer outstanding.

 



 

(g) The Liquidated Damages shall be paid to the Holders requesting
registration in cash within ten (10) Business Days of the end of each such
30-day period. Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.04(g)_ shall
constitute such HoldersÂ’ exclusive remedy for such events. The Liquidated
Damages imposed hereunder shall be paid to such Holders in immediately
available funds. In no event will the aggregate amount of Liquidated Damages
paid to the Holders exceed 6% of the aggregate value of the USAC Common Units
to be sold by the Holders under the applicable Registration Statement, valued
using the Issue Price (the " ** _Liquidated Damages Cap_** "). If the
Partnership certifies that it is unable to pay the Liquidated Damages in cash
because such payment would result in a breach under any of the PartnershipÂ’s
or its subsidiariesÂ’ credit facilities filed as exhibits to the PartnershipÂ’s
SEC documents, then the Partnership may pay the Liquidated Damages in kind in
the form of the issuance of additional USAC Common Units. Upon any issuance of
USAC Common Units as Liquidated Damages, the Partnership shall promptly
prepare and file an amendment to the applicable Registration Statement prior
to its effectiveness adding such USAC Common Units to such Registration
Statement as additional Registrable Units. The determination of the number of
USAC Common Units to be issued as the Liquidated Damages shall be equal to
such amounts divided by the volume weighted average price of the USAC Common
Units on the National Securities Exchange for the five (5) consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day ending before the date on which the
Liquidated Damages payment is due. In addition to being subject to the

 



      
 

 



 

Liquidated Damages Cap, the payment of Liquidated Damages to the Holders shall
cease at such time as the Registrable Units of the Holders become eligible for
resale without limitation as to volume under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 2.05 _Expenses of Registration_. All expenses incurred in connection
with any Registrations pursuant to _Section 2.01_ and any Registration
pursuant to _Section 2.02_ of this Agreement, and any offerings under the
Registration Statements filed in such Registrations, excluding underwritersÂ’
discounts and commissions, but including without limitation all registration,
filing and qualification fees, word processing, duplicating, printersÂ’ and
accounting fees (including the expenses of any special audits or "cold
comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance),
fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. or listing fees,
messenger and delivery expenses, all fees and expenses of complying with state
securities or blue sky laws (including the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel for the underwriters in connection with blue sky qualifications),
and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Partnership (" **
_Registration Expenses_** "), shall be paid by the Partnership. The Holders
shall bear and pay the underwriting commissions and discounts applicable to
securities offered for their account in connection with any Registrations made
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.06 _Indemnification_. The Partnership shall indemnify, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the Holders against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of
investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) relating to
the Registrable Units arising out of or based upon any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or arising out of or
based upon any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except insofar
as the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information furnished
in writing to the Partnership by any Holder or to the Partnership by any
participating underwriter for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto. In connection
with an underwritten offering in which any Holder participates conducted
pursuant to a registration effected hereunder, the Partnership shall indemnify
each participating underwriter to the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification of the Holders.

 



 

(a) In connection with any Registration Statement in which any Holder is
participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Partnership in writing such
information as the Partnership reasonably requests for use in connection with
any such Registration Statement or Prospectus, or amendment or supplement
thereto, and such Holder shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the Partnership and its officers and directors, against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs (including reasonable costs of
investigation) and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) arising out
of or based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, but only

 



      
 

 



 

to the extent that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Partnership by or on behalf of such
participating Holder expressly for use therein. In connection with an
underwritten offering conducted pursuant to a registration effected hereunder,
the participating Holders shall indemnify each participating underwriter to
the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
Partnership.

 



 

(b) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (1) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying Person of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and (2) permit such indemnifying Person to assume the
defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
Person. Failure to so notify the indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from
any liability that it may have to an indemnified Person. The indemnifying
Person shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the
indemnified Person without its consent (but such consent will not be
unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying Person who is entitled to, and elects
to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to one local counsel) for all
Persons indemnified (hereunder or otherwise) by such indemnifying Person with
respect to such claim (and all other claims arising out of the same
circumstances), unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified Person
there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such
indemnified Person that are in addition to or may conflict with those
available to another indemnified Person with respect to such claim, in which
case each such indemnified Person shall be entitled to use separate counsel.
The indemnifying Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into or agree to any settlement relating to a claim or action for which
any indemnified Person would be entitled to indemnification by any indemnified
Person hereunder unless such judgment or settlement imposes no ongoing
obligations on any such indemnified Person and includes as an unconditional
term the giving, by all relevant claimants and plaintiffs to such indemnified
Person, a release, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such
indemnified Person, from all liabilities in respect of such claim or action
for which such indemnified Person would be entitled to such indemnification.

 



 

(c) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified Person or any officer or director of such indemnified Person and
shall survive the transfer of securities and the termination of this
Agreement, but only with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Units made
before such termination.

 



 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in or pursuant to this _Section 2.06_
is due in accordance with the terms hereof, but is held by a court to be
unavailable or unenforceable in respect of any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then each applicable indemnifying
Person, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified Person, shall contribute to
the amount paid or payable by such indemnified Person as a result of such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying Person, on the
one hand, and of the indemnified Person, on the other hand, in connection with
the statements or omissions which result in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying Person, on the one
hand, and of the indemnified Person, on the other hand, shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or

 



      
 

 



 

alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
indemnifying Person or by the indemnified Person, and by such PersonÂ’s
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission.

 



 

Section 2.07 _Lockup_. The Holders shall, in connection with any underwritten
offering of the PartnershipÂ’s securities, upon the request of the underwriters
managing the underwritten offering of the PartnershipÂ’s securities, agree in
writing not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of any Registrable
Units (other than that included in the registration) without the prior written
consent of the underwriters for such period of time as such underwriters may
specify, but in no event to exceed ten (10) days prior to the date of the
Prospectus and forty-five (45) days from the date of the Prospectus.

 



 

Section 2.08 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, except for the Series A Preferred Registration Rights
Agreement and the registration rights pursuant to the Partnership Agreement,
the Partnership shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holders of
a majority of the outstanding Registrable Units, enter into any agreement with
any current or future holder of any securities of the Partnership that would
allow such current or future holder to require the Partnership to include
securities in any registration statement filed by the Partnership on a basis
other than expressly subordinate to the piggyback rights of the Holders of
Registrable Units hereunder; _provided_ ; _however_ , that in no event shall
the Partnership enter into any agreement that would permit another holder of
securities of the Partnership to participate on a _pari passu_ basis (in terms
of priority of cut-back based on advise of underwriters) with a Demanding
Holder requesting Registration or an underwritten offering pursuant to
_Section 2.01_.

 



 

Section 2.09 _Sale Restrictions_. Each of the Energy Transfer Parties agrees
not to publicly or privately sell, dispose of or distribute any USAC Common
Units (including any USAC Common Units issuable upon the conversion of any
derivative securities) that are beneficially owned by such Holder, or issue
(publicly or privately) any derivative securities whose value is based on USAC
Common Units, until the expiration of the Holding Period. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Partnership Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, the Energy Transfer
Parties shall have no right to publicly or privately sell, dispose of or
distribute any USAC Common Units (including any USAC Common Units issuable
upon the conversion of any derivative securities), or issue (publicly or
privately) any derivative securities whose value is based on USAC Common
Units, prior to the expiration of the Holding Period. Commencing on the
expiration of the Holding Period, each of the Energy Transfer Parties agrees
not to effect any sale, disposition or distribution of greater than ten (10)
million USAC Common Units by either Energy Transfer Party in any six-month
period; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict the
ability of any Energy Transfer Party to sell, dispose of or distribute USAC
Common Units to any Person concurrently with the sale, transfer or other
disposition of the GP Owner Equity (as defined in the Restructuring Agreement)
in accordance with Section 2.5(a) of the Restructuring Agreement. Nothing
contained in this _Section 2.09_ shall prohibit any sale, disposition or
distribution of USAC Common Units by the Energy Transfer Parties to any of its
Affiliates so long as such Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this
_Section 2.09_.

Section 3.06 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Units under _Article II_ may be
transferred or assigned by each Holder to one or more transferees or assignees
of Registrable Units or securities convertible into Registrable Units;

Affiliate of, and after such transfer or assignment continues to be an
Affiliate of, such Holder, the amount of Registrable Units or securities
convertible into Registrable Units, as applicable, transferred or assigned to
such transferee or assignee shall represent at least $50 million of

 



      
 

 



 

Registrable Units (determined by multiplying the number of Registrable Units
owned by the average of the closing price on the National Securities Exchange
for the USAC Common Units for the ten (10) trading days preceding the date of
