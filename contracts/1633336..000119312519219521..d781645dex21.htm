ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_.

 

(a) _First Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

(i)  _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding and held by a Subsidiary of the Company or held, directly
or indirectly, by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor
or in respect thereof. 

(ii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any
shares canceled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i))_ shall be converted
into the right to receive (A) $3.1784 per share in cash, without interest
(such amount of cash, as may be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(iv)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, the "Cash Consideration") and (B) 0.4041
(such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iv)_, the
"Exchange Ratio") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
Parent common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Parent Common Stock")
(and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(v)_ and such share of Parent
Common Stock and any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, the "Share
Consideration") (the consideration payable

 



4

    

 in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)(A)_, and _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)(B)_, collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). Each share
of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall no longer
be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-entry shares
("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive,
upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the Merger Consideration. The amount of cash each holder
of Company Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall be rounded to the nearest cent, and computed after
aggregating all cash amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock held
by such holder.

(iii) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
(1) fully paid share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(iv)  _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (but
specifically excluding (A) sales of Parent Common Stock to the extent set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iv)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and (B)
issuances of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Parents dividend reinvestment
plan or otherwise in lieu of a portion of any cash dividend declared by
Parent) the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the
case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iv)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

(v) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common
Stock or to vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
All fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Common Stock
would be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations
shall be rounded to three (3) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the
amount of the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder would, but for this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(v)_, be entitled
under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ and (B) the Reference Price. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to

 



5

    

 holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount,
without interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
such cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(v)_ is not a separately bargained-
for consideration.

(b) _Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second
Merger and without any action on the part of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent or the holders of any securities of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the

Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist without any consideration being payable
therefor.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent and the Parent External Adviser shall enter into a customary
exchange agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent book-entry
shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_
in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to pay that portion of the Cash Consideration equal
to $1.5023 per share of Company Common Stock (as may be adjusted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.19_, the "Parent Cash Consideration"), and Parent shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ and (iii) the Parent External Adviser shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, cash in an aggregate amount
necessary to pay that portion of the Cash Consideration equal to $1.6761 per
share of Company Common Stock (the "Parent External Adviser Cash
Consideration") (such shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Cash
Consideration and Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration provided to the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). For
purposes of the deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(v)_. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall at any time be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (x) held for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock and (y) applied promptly to making the payments
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_,
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in the form and
have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify
and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates of Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, (C) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ and (D) cash

Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days following the later
to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agents receipt of
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
(A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing,
in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, (C) any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ and (D) cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(v)_,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock to
stockholders of record on or after the Effective Time shall be delivered to

thereof) or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such

 



7

    

 Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this
_Article II_. Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange for such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without
interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, and a payment date
subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that all dividends payable to
record holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ shall be payable in the form of shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with Parents dividend reinvestment plan (the
"Parent DRIP"), which form of payment the holder shall be deemed to have
elected. From and after the Effective Time, all dividends payable with
respect to the Share Consideration or Parent Common Stock issued in lieu of a
cash dividend in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ shall be issued
in the form of Parent Common Stock under the Parent DRIP until such time, if
any, as the relevant holder elects to "opt out" of the Parent DRIP.

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_) may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered,
if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the First Merger who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_  shall thereafter look only
to (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for
payment of their claims for Merger Consideration (other than the Parent
External Adviser Cash Consideration) and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ and
(ii) the Parent External Adviser as general creditor thereof for payment of
their claims for the Parent External Adviser Cash Consideration. Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those
of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration.

 



8

    

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Parent External Adviser or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the
date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, or with respect to any
such Merger Consideration consisting of Parent External Adviser Cash
Consideration, the Parent External Adviser, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent External Adviser
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Parent External Adviser or the Exchange Agent
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent External
Adviser or the Exchange Agent on behalf of the Person, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent External Adviser or the Exchange
Agent.

 

Section 2.3 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

Section 2.4 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, for
each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares.

operated in compliance, in all material respects, with all Applicable Law,
including, if and to the extent applicable, the Investment Company Act, the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, other than as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has not received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral
notification from a Governmental Authority of any material non-compliance with
any Applicable Law, which non-compliance would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 



12

action that would cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to be in violation of
the FCPA, or any other anticorruption or anti-bribery Laws applicable to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, other than any non-compliance that would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company is in compliance, and since it commenced operations, has
complied with its investment policies and restrictions and portfolio valuation
methods, if any, as such policies and restrictions have been set forth in its
registration statement (as amended from time to time) or reports that it

"Material Compliance Matters" for the Company, as such term is defined
in Rule 38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act, other than those that

all Permits required in order to permit the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to own or lease their properties and assets and to conduct their
businesses under and pursuant to all Applicable Law as presently conducted,
other than any failure to hold or non-compliance with any such Permit that
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are valid

Adverse Effect. The Company has not received any written or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, oral notification from a Governmental Authority of any
material non-compliance with any such Permits, and no Proceeding is
pending or threatened in writing to suspend, cancel, modify, revoke or
materially limit any such Permits, which Proceeding would have a Company

the Company or the Company Investment Adviser has been subject to
disqualification to serve in any capacity contemplated by the Investment
Company Act for any investment company (including a BDC) under Sections 9(a)
and 9(b) of the Investment Company Act, unless, in each case, such Person has
received exemptive relief from the SEC with respect to any such
disqualification. There is no material Proceeding pending and served or, to

disqualification.

continued and at all times has been in compliance in all material respects
with Section 15 of the Investment Company Act (to the extent applicable).
Neither the Company nor the Company Investment Adviser is in default under the
Company Investment Advisory Agreement, except where such default would not

Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the Company, except as would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that such enforcement
may be subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

with any such material no-action letters and exemptive orders.

_Section_ __ _ 3.5_ is made with respect to Company SEC Documents or
financial statements, "disclosure controls and procedures" or "internal

that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective, contained any untrue statement of a

and-desist or other enforcement action by, or is a party to any Contract,
consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any Order by,
or has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request
of, any Governmental Authority that currently restrict the conduct of its
business (or that would, to the Knowledge of the Company, upon consummation
of the First Merger restrict in any respect the conduct of the business of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), or that relate to its capital adequacy,

Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (other than
Parent, Acquisition Sub, Parent External Adviser and their respective
Affiliates). 

Section 3.22 _Insurance_. The Company or its Affiliates have paid, or caused
to be paid, all premiums due under all material insurance policies covering
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and all such insurance policies are in full
force and effect other than as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received written
notice that they are in default with respect to any obligations under such

ARTICLE IV

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_

 

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any disclosure under the
headings "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," or any similar heading regarding
forward-looking statements) or as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter,
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including Acquisition Sub) is a corporation or other entity,
duly organized, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has the requisite entity power and authority to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted, to own and use its assets in the
manner in which its assets are currently used, and to perform its obligations
under all Parent Material Contracts to which it is a party, except where the
failure to be in good standing, to have such power and authority, to own and
use such assets or to perform its obligations under such Company Material
Contracts would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (including Acquisition Sub) is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the assets
owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company a copy of the Parent
Organizational Documents, as currently in effect, and neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub is in violation of any provision of such documents.
Parent has duly elected to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to the Investment
Company Act and such election has not been revoked or withdrawn and is in full
force and effect.

Section 4.5 _Permits; Compliance with Laws_.

 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have been
operated in compliance, in all material respects, with all Applicable Law,
including, if any to the extent applicable, the Investment Company Act, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act other than as would not have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written or, to the Knowledge of Parent, oral notification
from a Governmental Authority of any material non-compliance with any
Applicable Law, which non-compliance would result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and
since it commenced operations, has complied with its investment policies
and restrictions and portfolio valuation methods, if any, as such policies
and restrictions have been set forth in its registration statement (as amended
from time to time) or reports that it has filed with the SEC under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and other Applicable Laws, if any, other
than any non-compliance that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) None of Parent or its Subsidiaries is in default or violation of any (i)
Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) Permits necessary
for Parent and its Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as now
being conducted, except for any such defaults or violations that would not
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Parent has written policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Rule
38a-1 under the Investment Company Act that are reasonably designed to
prevent material violations of the "Federal Securities Laws," as such term is
defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the Investment Company Act. There have been
no "Material Compliance Matters" for Parent, as such term is defined in Rule
38a-1(e)(2) under the Investment Company Act, other than those that have been
reported to the Parent Board and satisfactorily remedied or are in the
process of being remedied or those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(d) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries holds and is in compliance with all
Permits required in order to permit Parent and each of its Subsidiaries to
own or lease their properties and assets and to conduct their businesses under
and pursuant to all Applicable Law as presently conducted, other than any
failure to hold or non-compliance with any such Permit that would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, oral notification from a Governmental Authority of any
material non-compliance with any such Permits, and no Proceeding is pending or
threatened in writing to suspend, cancel, modify, revoke or materially limit
any such Permits, which Proceeding would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(e) No "affiliated person" (as defined under the Investment Company Act) of
Parent or the Parent External Adviser is subject to disqualification to serve
in any capacity contemplated by the Investment Company Act for any investment
company (including a BDC) under Sections 9(a) and 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act, unless, in each case, such Person has received exemptive relief
from the SEC with respect to any such disqualification. There is no material
Proceeding pending and served or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened that
would result in any such disqualification.

 



27

    

(f) The minute books and other similar records of Parent contain a true
and complete record in all material respects of all action taken at all
meetings and by all written consents in lieu of meetings of the stockholders
of Parent, the Parent Board and any committees of the Parent Board.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_ is made with respect to Parent SEC Documents or
financial statements, "disclosure controls and procedures" or "internal
control over financial reporting," intellectual property matters, Tax matters,
real property matters or environmental matters, which are addressed
exclusively in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ ( _Parent SEC Documents; Financial
Statements; Enforcement Actions_ ), _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ ( _Disclosure
Controls and Procedures_ ),  _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ ( _Trademarks, Patents and

Parent 10-Q, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, or,
if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Investment Company Act, as the
case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made,
not misleading (or, in the case of a Parent SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or
amendment became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading).

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and the
related consolidated schedules of investments) of Parent included in the
Parent SEC Documents (i) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and their consolidated statements of operations
and consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal year-
end audit adjustments, to the absence of notes and to any other adjustments
described therein, including in any notes thereto), (ii) were prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (iii)
were prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of

agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any Order by, or has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request of, any
Governmental Authority that currently restrict the conduct of its business (or
that would, to the Knowledge of Parent, upon consummation of the First Merger
restrict in any respect the conduct of the business of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries), or that relate to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay
dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance policies, its internal
controls, its management or its business, other than those of general
application that apply to similarly situated BDCs or their Subsidiaries,
except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor has Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, verbally by any Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing,
initiating, ordering or requesting any of the foregoing that would have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

supplied by or on behalf of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Parent
External Adviser expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a)
the Form N-14 will, at the time the Form N-14 is filed with the SEC, and at
any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the Joint
Proxy Statement will, at the date it or any amendment or supplement is mailed
to stockholders of the Company and stockholders of Parent, at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting and at the time of the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (except that
no representation or warranty is made by Parent or Acquisition Sub regarding
such portions thereof that relate expressly to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to statements made therein based on information supplied by
or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein).

 

Section 4.8 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. Parent and its Subsidiaries
maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" and "internal control over

respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act.

Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2018

if applicable) or the notes thereto included in the Parent SEC Documents, (b)
for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
since June 30, 2019, (c) for liabilities or obligations incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (d) for liabilities and obligations

of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) of Parent.

 

Section 4.11 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) there is no
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect

outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any
Governmental Authority involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, in
the case of this clause (ii), would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.12 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote to approve the First Merger or (ii) agrees to vote against any
Superior Proposal; or (b) any Third Party has agreed to provide, directly or

part the First Merger.

 

Section 4.13 _Employee Matters_. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has at any time during the immediately preceding six years (a)

stock option or other equity based, severance, termination, retention, change
of control, pension, retirement, deferred compensation, fringe benefit,
health, medical or other similar employee benefit plan, program or agreement
covering any of their respective current or former employees, directors or
individual independent contractors. No material liability under Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA has, during the immediately preceding six years, been
incurred by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that

(either alone or in combination with another event) increase the amount of, or
accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting of, any compensation or
benefits due to any current or former employee or director of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, the assets of Parent are not,
and at no time have been, deemed to include "plan assets" within the meaning

any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between

respect to each taxable year thereafter, and expects to so qualify for its
taxable year including the Effective Time. No challenge to Parents status as
a RIC is pending or has been threatened in writing.

(k) Each Subsidiary of the Parent that is a partnership, joint venture, or
limited liability company has been since its formation treated for United

(l) No claim has been made in writing by a Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction
where the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the
Parent or any such Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction, and which, if upheld, would reasonably result in a material
Tax liability.

(m) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for the
Taxes of another Person other than the Parent and its Subsidiaries under

pledged in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice to
secure obligations of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries and except for Liens
consisting of restrictions on transfer agreed to in respect of investments
entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this
Agreement, there have been no material changes to the amount of securities,
indebtedness and other financial instruments listed on Parents most recent
schedule of investments included in the Parent SEC Documents, including any
increase in the amount of securities, indebtedness and other financial
instruments owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries that are not treated as
"qualifying assets" under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act.

Section 4.27 _Parent Investment Advisory Agreement_. The Parent Investment
Advisory Agreement has been duly approved and continued and is in compliance
in all material respects with Section 15 of the Investment Company Act (to the
extent applicable). Neither Parent nor the Parent External Adviser is in
default under the Parent Investment Advisory Agreement, except where such

Section 6.3 _Preparation of the Form_ __ _ N_ _-14 and the Joint Proxy
Statement; Stockholder Meetings_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i)
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare, and Parent and the Company, as
applicable, shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed with
the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii) Parent shall
prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation), and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form N-14,
in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the First Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Form N-14 and the Joint
Proxy Statement to comply with the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC and (ii) have the Form N-14 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments from the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the
Form N-14, take all action reasonably required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Parent Stock Issuance.
Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may
be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form N-14 and the Joint Proxy
Statement. As promptly as practicable after the Form N-14 shall have become
effective, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective
stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form N-14 will
be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company, in each case without
providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating
to Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form N-14 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the

 



46

    

 statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be prepared and, following a reasonable
opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and comment on
such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the
Company. Subject to Applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly
of the time when the Form N-14 has become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the First Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form N-14 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form N-14 or the First Merger.

(b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VII_ , the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the effectiveness of the Form N-14, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a
date selected by the Company in reasonable consultation with Parent, which
date is intended to be the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting) and hold
a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for
the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that the
Company may postpone or adjourn to a later date the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies if the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to approve the First Merger, whether
or not a quorum is present, (iv) if required by Applicable Law or (v) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel), the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
directors duties under Applicable Law. If the Company Board has not made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, through the Company
Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable
best efforts to lawfully solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the approval of the First Merger. Except as expressly permitted in _Section_
__ _ 6.6_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (x)
withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw or modify or qualify the Company Recommendation, in each case in a
manner materially adverse to Parent, (y) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or (z) approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, any Competing Proposal ((x), (y) and (z) being
referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall
continue in full force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company of any Competing Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

 



47

    

(c) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with 
_Article VIII_ , Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
effectiveness of the Form N-14, duly call, give notice of, convene (on a date
selected by Parent in reasonable consultation with the Company, which date is
intended to be the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting) and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that Parent
may postpone or adjourn to a later date the Parent Stockholders Meeting (i)
with the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies if Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to approve the Parent Stock Issuance, the
Parent Investment Advisory Agreement Amendment and the Parent Maryland
Reincorporation, whether or not a quorum is present, (iv) if required by
Applicable Law or (v) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure if, in the good faith
judgment of the Parent Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

mutually agreed by the Company and Parent) make and not withdraw (without the
Companys consent) its respective filings under the HSR Act, and thereafter
make any other applications and filings as reasonably determined by the
Company and Parent under other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than as required by Law. Parent shall pay all filing fees and
other charges for the filings required under any Antitrust Law by the Company

48

    

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree to take (and to cause their
Affiliates to take) promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all Consents under any
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or United States federal,
state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including committing to or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise,
the sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not be
required to take any actions that would result in either a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub will, and will
cause the Company Investment Adviser and the Parent External Adviser, as
applicable, to, furnish to the other such necessary information and

cooperate in responding to any investigation or other inquiry from a
Governmental Authority or in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a
private party, including immediately informing the other party of such

the termination of this Agreement), the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within two (2) Business Days of
receipt by it or any of its Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any

Company and its Representatives may contact such Third Party solely to
clarify any ambiguous terms and conditions thereof (without the Company Board
being required to make the determination in clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _
6.6(c)_) and (ii) the Company and the Company Board and its Representatives
may engage or participate in negotiations or substantive discussions with, or
furnish any information and other access to, any Third Party making such
Competing Proposal and its Representatives, Affiliates and prospective debt
and equity financing sources if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that such Inquiry or Competing Proposal (A) either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(B) that failure to consider such Inquiry or Competing Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors duties
under Applicable Law;  _provided_ that (x) such Competing Proposal did not
result from any material breach of any of the provisions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, (y) prior to furnishing any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries the Company receives from such
Person, to the extent such Person is not already subject to a confidentiality
agreement with the Company, a confidentiality agreement containing
confidentiality terms that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (unless the
Company and Parent agree to amend the Confidentiality Agreement to reflect
such more favorable terms) (it being understood and agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making of Competing Proposals
(and related communications) to the Company or the Company Board) (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), and (z) the Company shall (subject
to the terms of any confidentiality agreement existing prior to the date
hereof) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide or
make available to Parent any written non-public information concerning it or
its Subsidiaries that it provides to any Third Party given such access that
was not previously made available to Parent or its Representatives. It is
understood and agreed that any contacts, disclosures, discussions or
negotiations permitted under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, including any public
announcement that the

 



54

    

 Company or the Company Board has made any determination required under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_ to take or engage in any such actions where the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in
connection with such public disclosure shall not constitute a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation or otherwise constitute a basis for Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_;

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) the Company
Board shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) the
Company Board shall not approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or definitive merger or similar agreement with respect to any
Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may (x)
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, upon the occurrence of an
Intervening Event, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company directors duties
under Applicable Law or (y) if the Company has received a Competing Proposal
that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, authorize, adopt or approve such Superior Proposal and cause or
permit the Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)(ii)_, and, _provided_ that, in the case of either clause (x) or (y):

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days in advance, that it intends to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") and/or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_ (a "Notice
of Superior Proposal"), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or termination and (A)
in the case of a Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making such Superior Proposal accompanied by a copy of the written
Competing Proposal and any related transaction or financing documents, or (B)

caused its Representatives to be available to negotiate, with Parent and
Acquisition Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and Acquisition Sub
desire to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day period to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would obviate the
need for the Company to effect the Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_; and

 



55

    

(iii) following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and, with respect to clause (A) below, its financial advisor,
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent in response to the Notice of Adverse Recommendation and/or Notice of
Superior Proposal, that (A) the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) in the case of
an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company directors duties under Applicable Law;
_provided_ , that any amendment, supplement or modification of any Competing
Proposal shall be deemed a new Competing Proposal and the Company may not
enter into any such Competing Proposal pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.6(d)_ or effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_ unless the Company has complied with the requirements
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_ with respect to such new Competing Proposal,
including sending an additional Notice of Superior Proposal and/or Notice of
Adverse Recommendation.

(e) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof from (i) complying with its required disclosure obligations
under Applicable Law or applicable NASDAQ rules and regulations regarding a
Competing Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) except as provided in the next sentence, any disclosure
made as permitted under clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ (other
than any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar communication) that relates to a
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in connection with such disclosure, and (y) neither the Company
nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall be permitted to
recommend any Competing Proposal or otherwise effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section_
__ _ 6.6_.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of Persons
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Affiliate thereof) (A) with respect
to a merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition,
asset acquisition, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, any Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) of Persons would hold securities representing more
than 20% of the total outstanding voting power of the Company after giving
effect to the consummation of such transaction, or (B) relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, tender
offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset acquisition, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or similar transaction), in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of (1) assets or businesses (including any mortgage, pledge or
similar disposition thereof but excluding any bona fide
financing transaction) that constitute or

 



56

    

 represent, or would constitute or represent if such transaction is
consummated, twenty percent (20%) or more of the total assets, net revenue or
net income of the Company and such its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2)
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company or in any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Mergers.

 

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide written Competing Proposal
(with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to
fifty percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside
legal advisors, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms, considering all legal, regulatory and financial aspects of the proposal
(including certainty of closing) and such other factors as the Company Board
considers to be appropriate, and if consummated, would be more favorable,
from a financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders than the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing in response to
such Competing Proposal made to the Company under the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 6.6(d)(i)_).

 

Section 6.7 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers, managers, or employees, as the case may be, of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Company Investment Adviser (to extent related
to the management of the Company) (collectively, the "DandO Indemnified
Parties") as provided in their respective organizational documents as in
effect on the date of this Agreement or in any Contract as in effect on the
date of this Agreement shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to the DandO Indemnified Parties
with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to
the fullest extent that the Company or its Subsidiaries would be permitted by
Applicable Law and to the fullest extent required by the
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries as in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or
resolution of such claim. To the maximum extent permitted by the Laws of the
State of Delaware, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause its and the Surviving Corporations articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of
director, officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the
DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Companys and its
Subsidiaries organizational documents as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO
Indemnified Parties.

 



57

    

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_, to the
fullest extent that the Company and Parent would be permitted by Applicable
Law to do so, Parent shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each DandO
Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent such claim, Proceeding or investigation
arises out of or pertains to: (A) any alleged action or omission in such DandO
Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; (B) any alleged
action or omission in such DandO Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer or employee of the Company Investment Adviser solely as it relates to
services to, or actions taken on behalf of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or (C) this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, Proceeding or investigation the expenses
(including attorneys fees) of any DandO Indemnified Party upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that such DandO Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified by Applicable Law. Any determination required to be
made with respect to whether the conduct of any DandO Indemnified Party complies
or complied with any applicable standard shall be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the DandO Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the fees of such counsel shall be paid by
Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 6.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent shall not settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, Proceeding or investigation,
unless either (x) such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of all of the DandO Indemnified Parties
covered by the claim, Proceeding or investigation from all liability arising
out of such claim, Proceeding or investigation or (y) the DandO Indemnified
Parties covered by the claim, Proceeding or investigation provide their prior
written consent to such settlement, compromise, consent or termination.

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to purchase and maintain in
full force and effect a six (6) year "tail" policy, on terms and conditions
no less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Parties than the existing
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement, covering claims
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_
that Parent shall not be required to pay a total premium for such "tail"
policy in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but in such case shall
purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount). Parent shall
not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, take any action that would
prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of
any such insurance, whether in respect of claims arising before or after the
Effective Time.

(d) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. The
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of
each DandO Indemnified Party and his or her successors, heirs or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees,

 



58

    

 that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in enforcing its indemnity
and other rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and shall be
enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or
representatives.

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to Applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement,
the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
and (b) any claims, investigations or Proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ _ _ (and, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall limit the rights of the Company or the Company Board under _Section_ __
_ 6.6_), prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the parties or their Affiliates
shall issue any such press release or public announcement prior to obtaining
the other parties consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or
any listing agreement of any party hereto so long as the disclosing party
gives notice to and consults with the other party prior to making such
disclosure to the extent reasonably practicable. The Company may communicate
to its employees, Portfolio Companies, customers, suppliers and consultants

Section 6.15 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) For United States federal income Tax purposes, (i) the parties intend that
the Mergers, taken together, constitute an integrated plan of the type
contemplated in IRS Revenue Ruling 2001-46 and will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the
"Intended Tax Treatment"), (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is
hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 354 and
361 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a),
to which the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub are parties under Section
368(b) of the Code, and (iii) the parties intend that the Parent External
Adviser Cash Consideration shall be treated as the receipt of cash
consideration in connection with the Mergers and in exchange for Company
Common Stock.

 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent, and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Mergers to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment,
including by not taking any action that such party knows is reasonably likely
to prevent such qualification. Each of the Company, Parent, and Acquisition
Sub shall report the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinion described in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_, including making
representations and covenants requested by Tax counsel in order to render such
Tax opinion. Prior to the Effective Time (or at such other times as requested
by counsel), each of Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver to Tax
counsel, tax representation letters reasonably requested by Tax counsel to
enable the issuance of the Tax opinion described in  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_.
Each of the Company, Parent, the Parent External Adviser and Acquisition Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be
taken any action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the
representations and covenants made to Tax counsel in furtherance of such Tax
opinion.

 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, (i) Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Company take any action, or
knowingly fail to take any action, which action or failure to act
is reasonably likely to cause Parent to fail to qualify as a RIC, and (ii)
the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Parent, take any
action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or failure to act
is reasonably likely to cause the Company to fail to qualify as a RIC.

 



61

    

Section 6.16 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) to cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the First Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, at
or prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.17 _Takeover Statutes and Provisions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Acquisition Sub will take any action that would cause the First Merger and
related transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover
Statutes. Each of the Company and Parent shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the First Merger
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Statute, as now or hereafter in effect.

 

Section 6.18 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall
reasonably cooperate and consult with one another in connection with the
defense and settlement of any Proceeding by the Companys stockholders or
Parents stockholders against any of them or any of their respective
directors, officers or Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company (a) shall
provide the other party with prompt written notice of any such Proceeding
brought by its stockholders and shall keep the other party reasonably informed
of any material developments in connection therewith and (b) shall not settle
any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).

 

Section 6.19 _Coordination of Dividends_. Parent and the Company shall
coordinate with each other in designating the record and payment dates for
any quarterly dividends or distributions to its stockholders, including a Tax
Dividend, declared in accordance with this Agreement in any calendar quarter
in which the Closing Date might reasonably be expected to occur. In the event
that a dividend or distribution with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a record date prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the Effective Time,
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
such dividend or distribution after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date and, in connection therewith, the Company shall deposit such
dividend or distribution with the Exchange Agent to be paid to such holders
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ in the same manner as the Cash
Consideration. Prior to the Closing Date, if the aggregate amount of all (a)
dividends paid by the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement plus
(b) all Quarterly Dividends paid after the date of this Agreement is less than
the amount that should be paid as a dividend to distribute to the Companys
stockholders the amounts set forth in (i) through (iv) of the definition of
"Tax Dividend" or otherwise necessary for the Company to maintain its
qualification as a RIC as reasonably determined by the Company, the Company
shall declare a Tax Dividend. For all federal income tax purposes, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent and the Company shall treat
the payments of any Tax Dividend by the Exchange Agent, as agent on behalf of
the Company, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ as a payment of a dividend
considered to have been paid by the Company in the Companys last federal
income tax year pursuant to Section 855 of the Code. The amount of any Tax
Dividend declared by the Company shall reduce the Parent Cash

 



62

    

 Consideration by an amount equal to the per share amount of such Tax
Dividend; _provided_ , that if the aggregate amount of all such Tax Dividends
declared on or after the date hereof exceeds the amount of the Parent Cash
Consideration, Parent and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to adjust
the Exchange Ratio to account for such Tax Dividends.

First Merger, Parent shall convert to a Maryland corporation in accordance
with the MGCL and the DGCL. In connection with the Parent Maryland
Reincorporation, the Articles of Incorporation to be filed by Parent shall be
identical to those set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ hereto and shall remain in
effect until thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law and the
applicable provisions of such Articles of Incorporation (subject to _Section_
__ _ 6.7_). The Parent Maryland Reincorporation is intended to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code.

 

Section 6.21 _Stock Repurchase Program_. Parent shall implement a stock
repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") for a period of twelve months
following the Effective Time pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (
_provided_ that the earliest the Repurchase Program shall be required
to commence is four weeks after the date that the Parent Common Stock has
commenced trading on NASDAQ) to repurchase in open market transactions,
subject to compliance by Parent with any of its liquidity, covenant, leverage
and regulatory requirements and the approval and continuation of such program
by the Parent Board in light of its duties under Applicable Law, shares of
Parent Common Stock in an aggregate amount of up to $20,000,000 (subject to
the adjustment described in the immediately following proviso, the "Maximum
Repurchase Amount") at market prices at any time the shares of Parent Common
Stock trade below ninety percent (90%) of Parents then-most recently
disclosed net asset value; _provided_ that the Maximum Repurchase Amount
shall be $20,000,000 less the amounts purchased under any similar 10b5-1 plan
that is entered into by Affiliates of Parent or Parent External Adviser with
respect to Parent Common Stock at a price equal to or higher than the price
contemplated by the Repurchase Program.

Section 6.22  _Parent_ __ _s Financing Activities_.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain
the Debt Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including
the market flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter delivered

Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, (vi) upon satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions and the other conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and

any of the following: (i) of any termination of (A) the Debt Commitment
Letter, (B) any definitive agreement relating to the Debt Financing or (C) any
definitive agreement relating to a portion of the Debt Financing (ii) any
actual or threatened material breach, default, termination or repudiation of
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreement by any
party thereto or any event or circumstance that makes a condition precedent
to the Debt Financing unable or unlikely to be satisfied, in each case, of
which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will
not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter. Parent will not, nor permit any of its Affiliates to,
without the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter
into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
prevent consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent will not agree to, or permit, any amendment,
modification, joinder, assignment, termination or waiver of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
modification, joinder, termination or waiver (i) imposes additional or

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _

67

    

(ii) prior to the Effective Time, any Governmental Authority of competent

have used its reasonable best efforts to remove such Order or other action;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the

Agreement; or

 

(iii) (A) the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have been duly held and completed and the

(i) Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Parent External Adviser shall have breached
or failed to perform any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or
failure to perform (A) would result in the failure of a condition set forth in

Acquisition Sub, or the Parent External Adviser, as applicable, by the
Termination Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Parent External Adviser, as applicable, on or
before the earlier of (x) the Termination Date and (y) the date that is thirty
(30) days following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such
breach or failure to perform;  _provided_ that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(i)_
if the Company is then in material breach of any of its material obligations
under this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)(i)_ if Parents breach has been primarily caused by a breach of any

68

    

(ii) at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in
order to substantially concurrently enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement providing for a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and

Parents delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach or failure
to perform; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i)_ if Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Parent External Adviser is then in material breach of any of its
material obligations under this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _further_
, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 8.1(d)(i)_ if the Companys breach has been primarily caused by a breach of

effect without liability on the part of any party hereto, and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, no such termination shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any intentional or willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or fraud, in which case,
except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_,

69

    

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_ _s_.

 

(a) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i) (_but only if the breach
giving rise to such termination under _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i)_ was an
intentional breach), or either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)(A)_, and in either such case (x)
prior to such termination (or of the Company Stockholders Meeting in the case
of termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)(iii)(A)_), a Competing
Proposal that has been made after the date of this Agreement shall have been
publicly disclosed and not withdrawn prior to such date and (y) within twelve
(12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Competing Proposal with a Third Party, and such
Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such
consummation happens prior to or following such twelve (12)-month period) (
_provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)(i)_, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of
Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(ii)_,

 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee.

 

Any payments required to be made under this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated
by Parent, (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the same day as the
consummation of the transaction contemplated therein, (y) in the case of
clause (ii) above, immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with
such termination and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, promptly, but in
no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, Parents right to receive payment from the
Company of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_,
shall constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and
Acquisition Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Representatives or assignees (collectively, the "Company Related Parties") and
any Financing Source for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except that the Company shall also be
obligated with respect to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.6_).

 



70

    

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such fee or expenses are payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the other for the payment of any amount set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
(solely on behalf of itself) (i) waives any rights or claims and (ii) agrees
not to commence any Proceeding, in each case against any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or in respect of any other
document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect
of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith and agrees to cause any such Proceeding
caused by the Company (solely on behalf of itself) to be dismissed and
otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source shall have any
liability for any claims or damages to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ , that nothing
herein to the contrary shall prohibit Parent from enforcing its rights
directly against the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing or causing the
Financing Sources to fund (including by seeking specific performance
thereunder) pursuant to the Debt Financing (and Parent agrees to do so
consistent with its covenants and obligations in this Agreement).

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Applicable Law, the parties hereto may
modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and delivered by
the duly authorized officers of each of the respective parties; _provided_
that no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment shall by
Applicable Law require further approval of the stockholders of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment shall be subject to
the approval of such stockholders and (b) without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources, no amendment shall be made to this Agreement that
would adversely affect the rights of the Financing Sources as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, _Section_
__ _ 9.8_ and  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_.

 



71

    

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Mergers are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party (without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company) in whole or in part to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.
At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent may (a) waive
or extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Parent External Adviser, in the case of the
Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent, or (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Parent External Adviser, in the case of the Company,
or the Company, in the case of Parent. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party and expressly setting forth the
nature of such extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

Section 8.6 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein
(including  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_), all expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, _provided_ that Parent shall pay all costs and
expenses in connection with the filings of the notification and report forms
under the HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Other than Taxes imposed upon holders of Company Common Stock, Parent shall
pay all (a) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and (b) sales, use,
gains, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement.

the extent governed by the Investment Company Act, in which case the latter
shall control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that
any interpretation of any commitment letters or fee letters related to the
Debt Financing and all matters relating thereto, shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
New York. The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding brought by any party to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or if
jurisdiction over the matter is vested exclusively in federal courts,
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and the
appellate courts to which orders and judgments therefore may be appealed
(collectively, the "Acceptable Courts"). In any such judicial proceeding, each
of the parties further consents to the assignment of any proceeding in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland to the Business and Technology Case
Management Program pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-205 (or any successor
thereof). Each of the parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any
Acceptable Court in any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or

benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise
in such Proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any Proceeding in any such Acceptable Court or that
any such Proceeding brought in any such Acceptable Court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources and their respective current,
former or future directors, officers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, controlling Persons, Affiliates, employees
or Representatives in any way

 



76

    

 relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof). EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, IN EACH CASE INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING. Each party hereto (a) certifies
that no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of any action, suit
or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) certifies that it
makes this waiver voluntarily and (c) acknowledges that it and the other
parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by,
among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section_ __
_ 9.8_.

Section 9.9  _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
any party hereto does not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (without proof of actual
damages), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ is not intended and shall
not be construed to limit in any way the provisions of _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.9(a)_ or anything else to the contrary,
it is expressly agreed that the right of the Company to obtain an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parents and Acquisition Subs obligation to effect the Closing, shall be
subject to the requirements that: the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are intended to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to those conditions being capable of
being satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the Closing would have
occurred or been required to occur pursuant to  _Article I_.

 



77

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, while each of
the parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
(but subject to the limitations of) this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and the payment
of monetary damages, including the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, in
no event will any of the parties be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ that results in
a Closing and any monetary damages, including all or any portion of the
Company Termination Fee, as applicable.

Section 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
signed counterpart of this Agreement.

STOCK

 

Section 6.1 _Authorized Shares_. The Corporation has authority to issue
200,010,000 shares of stock, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), and 10,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Preferred Stock"). The aggregate
par value of all authorized shares of stock having par value is $200,010. If
shares of one class of stock are classified or reclassified into shares of
another class of stock pursuant to Section 6.2, 6.3 or 6.4 of this Article VI,
the number of authorized shares of the former class shall be automatically
decreased and the number of shares of the latter class shall be automatically
increased, in each case by the number of shares so classified or reclassified,
so that the aggregate number of shares of stock of all classes that
the Corporation has authority to issue shall not be more than the total
number of shares of stock set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph.
The Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire Board
and without any action by the stockholders of the Corporation, may amend the
Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of
shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that
the Corporation has authority to issue.

 



Exhibit A-7

    

Section 6.2 _Common Stock_. Except as may otherwise be specified in the
Charter, each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one
vote. The Board of Directors may reclassify any unissued shares of Common
Stock from time to time into one or more classes or series of stock.

 

Section 6.3 _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors may classify any
unissued shares of Preferred Stock and reclassify any previously classified
but unissued shares of Preferred Stock of any series from time to time, into
one or more classes or series of stock.

 

Section 6.4 _Classified or Reclassified Shares_. Prior to issuance of
classified or reclassified shares of any class or series, the Board of
Directors by resolution shall: (a) designate that class or series to
distinguish it from all other classes and series of stock of the Corporation;
(b) specify the number of shares to be included in the class or series; (c)
set or change, subject to the express terms of any class or series of stock of
the Corporation outstanding at the time, the preferences, conversion or other
rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or
other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption
for each class or series; and (d) cause the Corporation to file articles
supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
Maryland ("SDAT"). Any of the terms of any class or series of stock set or
changed pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 6.4 may be made dependent upon
facts or events ascertainable outside the Charter (including determinations by
the Board of Directors or other facts or events within the control of the
Corporation) and may vary among holders thereof, provided that the manner in
which such facts, events or variations shall operate upon the terms of such
class or series of stock is clearly and expressly set forth in the articles
supplementary or other Charter document.

 



Exhibit A-8

    

Section 6.5 _Inspection of Books and Records_. A stockholder that is
otherwise eligible under applicable law to inspect the Corporations books of
account or stock ledger or other specified documents of the Corporation shall
have no right to make such inspection if the Board of Directors determines
that such stockholder has an improper purpose for requesting such inspection.

Section 6.6 _Special Effective Date of Transfer_. During the period ending
365 days after the date of the listing of the Common Stock on a national
securities exchange (the "Listing"), any transfer (whether by sale, gift,
merger, operation of law or otherwise), exchange, assign, pledge, hypothecate
or otherwise dispose of or encumber (collectively, "Transfer") of any shares
of Common Stock acquired in the Conversion to any person or entity shall be
effective on the applicable Effective Date described in this Section 6.6
unless (a) the Board of Directors provides prior written consent permitting an
earlier Effective Date and (b) the Transfer is made in accordance with
applicable securities and other laws. The "Effective Date" shall mean 180
days after the date of the Listing for all of the shares of Common Stock
acquired by a stockholder in the Conversion, 270 days after the date of the
Listing for two-thirds of the shares of Common Stock acquired by a
stockholder in the Conversion and 365 days after the date of the Listing for
one-third of the shares of Common Stock acquired by a stockholder in the
Conversion. The Board of Directors may impose certain conditions in
connection with granting its consent to an earlier Effective Date and any such
consent shall be granted in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. Any
purported Transfer of any shares of Common Stock effected on an earlier
Effective Date in violation of this Section 6.6 shall have no force or effect,
and the Corporation shall not register or permit registration of (and shall
direct its transfer agent, if any, not to register or permit registration of)
any such purported Transfer on its books and records until the applicable
Effective Date.
