Section 4.03 _Title Defects_ .

(a) The term " _Title Defect_ ," as used in this Agreement, means
any impairment, encumbrance, lien, encroachment, irregularity, defect in, or
dispute concerning Sellers ownership of or title to any Asset (excluding
Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title to
that Asset (without duplication). Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and
shall not be asserted as a Title Defect or a breach of Sellers special
warranty of title in the Assignment: (a) defects or irregularities arising
out of acknowledgment of documents, lack of entity authorization or a
variation in entity name, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such
entity action or variation was not authorized and results in another Persons
superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; (b) defects or irregularities
in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in
documents or omissions of heirship proceedings; (c) defects or irregularities
resulting from or related to probate proceedings or the lack of probate
proceedings if the defects or irregularities have been outstanding for five
(5) years or more; (d) conventional rights or reassignment normally actuated
by an intent to abandon or release a Lease and requiring notice to the holders
of such rights; (e) lack of a survey, unless a survey is required by Law; (f)
matters based solely on assertions that Sellers (or the
applicable operators) files lack information (including title opinions), to
the extent that such information is not material or is otherwise available;
(g) unreleased instruments (including prior oil, gas and/or mineral leases and
mortgages) which may be reasonably cured by an affidavit of non-production
and non-development or other affidavit in accordance with industry standards,
absent reasonable evidence that such instruments continue in force and effect
and constitute a superior claim of title to an Asset; or (h) calls on oil
and/or gas production under existing Contracts, provided that the holder of
such right must pay market price for any production purchased by virtue of
such call on production.

 



15 (b) Subject to Section 4.04(a), the value attributable to each Title
Defect (the " _Title Defect Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in a Title
Defect Notice shall be determined in good faith based upon the criteria set
forth below:

 

(i) If the Title Defect asserted will reduce or prevent Buyer from receiving
payment from the purchasers of production from such Asset, then the Title
Defect Value of such Title Defect shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected
by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the discounted
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such other factors
as are reasonably necessary to make a proper evaluation and determination of
such Title Defect Value;

(ii) If the Title Defect asserted is that Sellers Net Revenue Interest in all
or a portion of such Asset is less than the Net Revenue Interest that is
attributable thereto set forth on Schedule 11.01, as specified with respect to
the specific depths or areal description for such Asset, then the Title Defect
Value of such Title Defect shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Asset, multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is an amount
equal to the remainder of (1) the Net Revenue Interest for such portion of the
Asset set forth on Schedule 11.01 minus (2) the Net Revenue Interest for such
portion of the Asset owned by Seller, and (B) the denominator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest for such Asset set forth on Schedule 11.01;

 

(iii) If the Title Defect asserted is that Sellers working interest in all or
a portion of such Asset is greater than the Working Interest that is
attributable thereto and set forth on Schedule 11.01, as specified with
respect to the specific depths or areal description for such Asset, without a
corresponding and proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest, then the
Title Defect Value of such Title Defect shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of such Asset, the relative change in the
interest, the discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
such Asset, and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a
proper evaluation;

(iv) If the Title Defect asserted is that Sellers number of Net Acres in all
or a portion of such Asset is below the number of Net Acres that is
attributable thereto and set forth on Schedule 11.01, as specified with
respect to the specific depths or areal description for such Asset, then the
Title Defect Value of such Title Defect shall be the product of the Allocated
Value of such Asset, multiplied by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is
an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the Net Acres for such portion of the
Asset set forth on Schedule 11.01 minus (2) the Net Acres for such Asset owned
by Seller and (B) the denominator of which is the Net Acres for such portion
of the Asset set forth on Schedule 11.01;

 

(v) If the Title Defect asserted is that (i) Seller owns a percentage interest
with respect to a mineral interest, royalty interest or overriding royalty
interest less than the percentage interest shown on Schedule 11.01, or (ii) as
to a mineral interest, royalty interest or overriding royalty interest owned
by Seller shown on Schedule 11.01, the number of gross acres covered by such
percentage interest shown on Schedule 11.01 is

 



16  less than the gross acres amount shown on such exhibit, then the Title
Defect Value of such Asset shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of such Asset, the relative change in the gross acres or the
percentage interest, and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation;

 

(vi) If the Title Defect asserted is that an Asset is subject to any lien or
encumbrance other than Permitted Encumbrances, then the Title Defect Value of
such Title Defect shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove such lien
or encumbrance from the Asset, not to exceed the Allocated Value of the
affected Asset; and

 

(vii) If the Title Defect asserted is based on a defect not described in (i)
through (vi) above, then the Title Defect Value of such Title Defect shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected Asset,
the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the
Title Defect, the discounted economic effect of the Title Defect over the
life of the affected Asset, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer
and Seller and such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation and determination of such adjustment.

 

(viii) In the event a Title Defect affects some, but not all, of the depths
for the applicable Asset described on Exhibit A, Exhibit B or Exhibit B-1
with respect to such Asset, then the Title Defect Value of such Title Defects
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value for such Asset,
the portion, including applicable depths described on Exhibit A, Exhibit B or
Exhibit B-1 with respect thereto, of the Asset affected by the Title Defect,
the legal effect of the Title Defect, the discounted economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and such other factors as
are reasonably necessary to make a proper evaluation and determination of such
adjustment.

(c) If a Title Defect affects an Asset that may be subject to a change in
interest after payout of the costs associated with drilling, completing, and
operating such Asset, the consequences of that fact shall be taken into
account in determining the Title Defect Value.

Section 4.04 _Notice of Title Defects_.

 

(a) If Buyer discovers any alleged Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer
shall notify Seller of the alleged Title Defect as promptly as possible but
no later than five (5) days before Closing. To be effective, this notice (a "
_Title Defect Notice_ ") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller no
later than five (5) days before Closing; (iii) include a description and
explanation of the Title Defect and the Asset affected thereby, (iv) include
such supporting documents relied upon by Buyer to determine the existence of
any such Title Defect (including, if applicable, a title abstract or "run-
sheet"), (v) include the Allocated Value of the Asset affected by such Title
Defect, and (vi) include Buyers good faith estimate of the Title Defect
Value, and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. "Title Defect
Value" shall mean the amount determined in accordance with Section 4.03, as
applicable, or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall (x) the
cumulative Title Defect Values for all Title Defects

 



17  affecting an Asset exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, and (y)
the Title Defect Value for any Title Defect duplicate, or include any amounts
reflected in, the Title Defect Value for any other Title Defect for the same
Asset. Any matters that otherwise may have constituted Title Defects, but that
are not so described in a timely Title Defect Notice complying and delivered
in accordance with this  _Section 4.04(a)_, shall be deemed to have been
waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted Encumbrances,
except to the extent such Title Defects constitute a breach of Section 4.06.

 

(b) After receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice, Seller shall have the
option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the Title Defect at any
time prior to the Closing.

(c) To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing possible
Title Defects, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or
before 5:00 p.m. Central Time each Friday prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period, notice of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period.

Section 4.05 _Remedies for Title Defects_.

(a) If Buyer notifies Seller of any Title Defect as provided in Section 4.04,
and Seller refuses or is unable to cure the Title Defect before Closing, then
Seller shall choose one of the following rights and remedies with respect to
the uncured Title Defect(s) in the Asset, unless the parties otherwise agree
in writing:

 

(i) Seller shall reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Value and
convey the affected Asset to Buyer at Closing;

 

(ii) Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
asserted Title Defect, together with all other Assets associated with such
Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such excluded Asset; or

 

(iii) Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
asserted Title Defect, together with all other Assets associated with such
Asset, and attempt to cure the Title Defect on or before the ninetieth (90th)
day after the Closing Date (the " _Title Defect Cure Date_ "), in which event
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such retained Asset, and in the event such Title Defect is cured during
such period, Seller shall convey such Asset to Buyer on or before the Title
Defect Cure Date by an Assignment and Bill of Sale substantially in the form
of the Assignment and the Allocated Value of such Asset shall be included as
an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final
Statement, but in the event such Title Defect is not cured during
such period, Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to
such asserted Title Defect and there shall be no further adjustment to the
Purchase Price with respect to such retained Asset.

 



18 (iv) In addition to the foregoing rights and remedies set forth in subparts
(i), (ii) and (iii) of this Section 4.05(a), Seller and Buyer will have the
termination rights set forth in Section 13.01.

 

(b) If any Title Defect is in the nature of a preferential right to purchase
or an unobtained consent to assignment or other restriction on assignability,
the provisions of _Section 4.07_ and _Section 4.08, respectively,_ shall
apply.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller (i) for individual asserted Title Defects that do not
exceed $50,000.00 (" _Individual Title Deductible_ "), which will be deemed to
be Permitted Encumbrances; and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Title
Defect Amounts for all such asserted Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Deductible, excluding any asserted Title Defects cured or disputed by
Seller, exceeds one percent (1%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the "
_Aggregate Title Deductible_ "), after which point Buyer shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller only to
the extent the sum of the Title Defect Values for such asserted Title Defects
exceeds the Aggregate Title Deductible; provided, however, that to the extent
Sellers ownership interest in any Asset is divided, for allocation purposes,
among more than one exhibit or schedule to this Agreement, the
Individual Title Deductible shall apply only once with respect to each such
Asset.

(d) Buyer and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve,
prior to Closing, any disagreements relating to (i) the existence of any
asserted Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Value attributable to a Title
Defect, or (iii) the existence or value of any asserted Title Benefit.

Section 4.06 _Special Warranty of Title_. The documents to be executed and
delivered by Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Assets as required
hereby, including any Assignment and Bill of Sale or other documents
customarily used in transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement
and agreed-to by the Parties (the " _Assignment_ "), shall provide for a
special warranty of title warranting title by, through and under Seller, but
not otherwise, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the terms of this
Agreement. Buyers remedy for breach of Sellers special warranty of title in
the Assignment shall be limited to an amount not exceeding the Allocated Value
of the affected Asset.

 

Section 4.07 _Preferential Rights To Purchase_.

 

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, to comply with all
preferential right to purchase provisions relative to any Asset (" _PPRs_ ")
prior to the Closing, but without any obligation to incur or pay any costs,
fees or payments other than costs customarily related to giving notices to PPR
holders and consummating the 

 



19  exercise of PPRs prior to Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify
Buyer of the existence of any known PPRs and if any PPRs are exercised or if
the requisite period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised.

(b) If, as of the Closing Date, a Third Party holder of a PPR has timely and
properly notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to
the Assets to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the
agreement in which the PPR arises), then the Assets covered by that PPR will
be sold to such holder of the PPR subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and will not be sold to the Party originally executing this
Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article) and
the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
excluded Assets. Buyer shall remain obligated to purchase the remainder of the
Assets not affected by an exercised PPR; provided, however, if the aggregate
value of (1) the Assets excluded from the sale to Buyer by the exercise of
such PPRs (as determined by the Allocated Values of such excluded Assets
subject to exercised PPRs), and (2) any Assets subject to a PPR that has not
been exercised (whether due to the PPR notice period or otherwise) exceeds
twenty percent (20%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller prior to Closing without
penalty. Upon the consummation of the sale of any Assets to the holder of such
PPR, any such Assets shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute "Excluded
Assets".

(c) After the Closing, if for any reason the purchase and sale of the Assets
covered by a PPR exercised prior to Closing under (b) above is not or cannot
be consummated with the holder of the PPR that exercised its PPR, Seller may
so notify Buyer and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of
such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall
purchase and accept from Seller such Assets pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and for the Allocated Value of such Assets (except the Closing Date
with respect to such Assets will be the date of assignment of such Assets from
Seller to Buyer). For the purpose of this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_
" means any calendar day excluding Saturdays, Sundays and other days on which
national banks are closed for business in Midland, Texas.

(d) Any interest in the Assets covered by any unexercised PPRs (whether due
to the PPR notice period or otherwise) shall be conveyed to Buyer at the
Closing subject to any PPRs, and Buyer shall assume all duties, obligations
and liabilities arising from the PPR. Without limiting the foregoing, if any
Third Party elects to purchase all or a part of an interest in any Asset
subject to a PPR after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be obligated to convey
that interest to that Third Party and shall be entitled to the
consideration for the sale of that interest.

Section 4.08 _Consents to Assignment_.

 

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, but without any
obligation to incur or pay any costs, fees or payments other than costs
customarily related to seeking consents from Third Parties, to obtain all
necessary consents from Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to the
Closing (other than approvals of any 

 



20  relevant Governmental Authority that are customarily obtained after the
Closing), and Buyer shall assist Seller with those efforts. However, except as
provided in (b) below, any unobtained consents shall not constitute Title
Defects.

(b) To the extent any such consents are not obtained prior to Closing and
an express provision of the document providing for the consent would render
the assignment of some or all of the Assets void or voidable, give rise to a
claim for specified liquidated damages or cause the termination of the Lease
or other Asset to be assigned as a result of the failure to obtain that
consent, then that failure shall constitute a Title Defect as to the portion
of the Assets affected thereby and Buyer, at its sole option, shall have the
right to exclude such Asset which is subject to a consent to assignment that
has not been obtained, by giving Seller written notice of such exclusion at
least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing. If Buyer elects to exclude any
such Asset, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of the Asset excluded; provided, however, if the
aggregate value of the Assets excluded from the sale to Buyer by the failure
to obtain an applicable consent (as determined by the Allocated Values
of such excluded Assets subject to such consents) exceeds twenty percent
(20%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then Buyer may terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Seller prior to Closing without penalty. If
Buyer elects to acquire such Asset at Closing even though a consent to
assignment has not been obtained, Buyer shall assume all obligations in
connection with such failure to obtain such consent, and such obligations
shall be Assumed Obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 4.09 _Title Benefits; Remedies_. If either Party discovers any Title
Benefit during the Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly
notify the other Party at or before the expiration of the Examination Period.
Seller shall be entitled to (i) an offset, equal to the aggregate value of all
Title Benefits, to the aggregate amount of all Title Defect Values
attributable to the Title Defects reflected on all Title Defect Notices for
purpose of determining if the Aggregate Title Deductible or Aggregate Defect
Threshold are met; and (ii) an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price if
the aggregate amount of Title Benefits exceeds the aggregate amount of all
Title Defect Values attributable to the Title Defects reflected on all Title
Defect Notices, but only by the amount such excess exceeds one percent (1%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Title Benefit_ " means the Sellers interest in any Asset that is greater
than or in addition to that set forth in Exhibit B, including a Net Revenue
Interest that is greater than that set forth in Exhibit B or Sellers Working
Interest in any Asset that is less than the Working Interest set forth in
Exhibit B (without a corresponding decrease in the Net Revenue Interest).

 

Article V

Environmental Matters

Section 5.01 _Environmental Review_.

 

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause an agent or representative
of Buyer reasonably acceptable to Seller (" _Buyer s Environmental
Consultant_") to conduct an environmental review of the Assets prior to the
expiration of the

 



21  Examination Period (" _Buyer s Environmental Review_"). The cost and
expense of Buyers Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by
Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyers Environmental Review shall
include: (i) a review of Sellers and the governments environmental records,
including any existing environmental reports or site assessments related to
the Assets, (ii) a site visit to inspect the Assets, (iii) interviews with
personnel of Seller knowledgeable of the condition and operation of the
Assets, who shall be designated by Seller, (iv) any other information
gathering and evaluation customarily performed by buyers to evaluate the
environmental condition of oil and gas properties in similar transactions; and
(v) and such additional evaluations, assessments, or reviews that may be
agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to commencement. Buyers Environmental
Review shall not include any intrusive test or procedure without the prior
written consent of Seller; provided, however, in the event that Buyers
Environmental Consultant reasonably determines such sampling or testing
with respect to an Asset is necessary (based upon industry standards) to
determine the existence of an environmental condition and such sampling or
testing is denied by Seller, at Buyers option, such Property shall be
retained by Seller and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Asset. Buyer shall, and shall cause Buyers Environmental
Consultant to, (i) consult with Seller before conducting any work comprising
Buyers Environmental Review, (ii) perform all such work in a safe and
workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere with the operation
of the Assets and (iii) comply with all applicable Law. Seller shall use
reasonable efforts, but shall not be required to incur additional costs or
expenses, to assist Buyer in obtaining any consents from a Third Party that
are required to perform any work comprising Buyers Environmental Review, and
Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting each such consent. Seller
shall have the right to have a representative or representatives accompany
Buyer and Buyers Environmental Consultant at all times during Buyers
Environmental Review. With respect to any samples taken in connection
with Buyers Environmental Review, Seller shall have the right to require
Buyer to take split samples and provide one such sample to Seller. Buyer
releases, and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Seller Indemnitees
from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of
action and judgments of any kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM
A SELLER INDEMNITEES SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR
STRICT LIABILITY, BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM A SELLER
INDEMNITEES GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) arising out of or
relating to Buyers Environmental Review. The obligations of Buyer set forth
in the preceding sentence shall survive the Closing or termination of this
Agreement for a period of one (1) year after the date of termination of this
Agreement, except as to obligations identified within such one (1) year
period, which shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement.

(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause
Buyers Environmental Consultant to, treat confidentially any matters
revealed by Buyers Environmental Review and any reports or data generated
from such review (the " _Environmental Information_ "), and Buyer shall not,
and shall cause Buyers Environmental Consultant and Buyers other
Representatives to not, disclose any

 



22  Environmental Information to any Governmental Authority or other Third Party
without the prior written consent of Seller. Prior to Closing, Buyer may use
the Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer, Buyers Environmental Consultant or
any Third Party to which Buyer has provided any Environmental Information
become legally compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information,
Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt notice sufficiently prior to any such
disclosure so as to allow Seller to file any protective order or seek any
other remedy, as any Seller deems appropriate under the circumstances. If
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the
Environmental Information to Seller, which Environmental Information shall
become the sole property of Seller without charge. The confidentiality and
other obligations set forth in this paragraph shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

Section 5.02 _Environmental Definitions_.

(a) _Assumed Environmental Obligations_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Assumed Environmental Obligations_ " means, with respect to Sellers
ownership and operation of the Assets conveyed to Buyer if Closing occurs or
the condition of the Assets conveyed to Buyer if Closing occurs and any
surface or subsurface depths used in connection with such Assets, including
any pooled, communitized or unitized acreage by virtue of the Assets being a
part of the pooled, communitized or unitized area (collectively, the "
_Subject Property_ "), all liabilities, losses, claims, obligations, costs or
expenses arising from or relating to the following: (i) any violation or
alleged violation of, or non-compliance with applicable Environmental Law
prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, including the cost of correcting
such violations or noncompliance; (ii) the release, discharge or disposal of
Hazardous Substances prior to, on or after the Effective Time, at, on, in,
under, from or migrating to or from the Subject Property, including claims
for property damage, loss, injury, damage to natural resources, and any
investigation, remediation or monitoring with respect to said Hazardous
Substances; and (iii) asserted Environmental Defects and those matters that
would otherwise be Environmental Defects but for the provisions of _Section
5.04(b)_.

(b) _Environmental Defects_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Environmental Defect_ " means, with respect to any portion of the Assets, any
condition at, under or in, or related to the Assets, which constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any claim or allegation of non-
compliance with, or result in any investigation, removal activities or
remediation required under, applicable Environmental Laws; excluding, however
any environmental conditions (i) deemed not to be Environmental Defects by
application of _Section 5.04(b)_ or (ii) relating to asbestos or NORM as
described in _Section 5.07_.

 

(c) _Environmental Defect Value_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Environmental Defect Value_ " means, with respect to any Environmental
Defect, the estimated amount of all reasonable costs, associated with the most
cost effective remediation, correction, elimination or cure of the
Environmental Defect, as reasonably determined in good faith by Buyers
Environmental Consultant. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for
in this Agreement for Environmental Defects shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of the Asset affected by such Environmental Defect.

 



23 (d) " _Environmental Laws_ " means all Laws pertaining to health (as relates
to exposure to Hazardous Substances) or the environment, including the Clean
Air Act, as amended, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act, as amended, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as
amended, the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Safe
Drinking Water Act, as amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended,
the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986, as amended, the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended, and comparable state and
local laws.

(e) _Hazardous Substances_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Hazardous Substances_ " means (i) any petrochemical or petroleum products,
oil or coal ash, radioactive materials, radon gas, asbestos in any form that
is or could become friable, urea formaldehyde foam insulation
and transformers or other equipment that contain dielectric fluid which may
contain levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, (ii) any chemicals, materials, or
substances defined as or included in the definition of "hazardous
substances," "hazardous wastes," "restricted hazardous materials," "extremely
hazardous substances," "toxic substances," "contaminants" or "pollutants" or
words of similar meaning and regulatory effect or (iii) any other chemical,
material or substance, exposure to which is prohibited, limited or regulated
by any applicable Environmental Law.

 

Section 5.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_. If Buyer discovers any
Environmental Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify Seller of the
alleged Environmental Defect as promptly as possible but no later than five
(5) days before Closing. To be effective, this notice (an " _Environmental
Defect Notice_ ") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller no later
than five (5) days before Closing; (iii) describe in reasonable detail the
Environmental Defect and shall include all data and information in Buyers and
Buyers Environmental Consultants possession or control bearing thereon, and
the good faith estimated Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto (and
the computations upon which Buyers estimate is based). Any matters that may
otherwise have constituted Environmental Defects, but that are not so
described in a timely Environmental Defect Notice complying with this _Section
5.03_, together with any environmental matter that does not constitute an
Environmental Defect, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all
purposes and constitute an Assumed Obligation. After receipt of an effective
Environmental Defect Notice, Seller shall have the option, but not the
obligation, to attempt to cure the Environmental Defect at any time prior to
the Closing.

To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing possible Environmental
Defects, Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before 5:00
p.m. Central Time each Friday prior to the expiration of the Examination
Period, notice of all Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the expiration of the Examination Period.

 



24 Section 5.04 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) If Buyer notifies Seller of any Environmental Defect as provided in
Section 5.03, and Seller refuses or is unable to cure the Environmental
Defect to Buyers reasonable satisfaction before Closing, Buyer shall choose
one of the following rights and remedies with respect to the uncured
Environmental Defect(s) in the Assets, unless the parties otherwise agree in
writing. The term "cure" or "curative" means, with respect to any
Environmental Defect, the undertaking and completion of those actions and
activities reasonably necessary to remediate, correct, eliminate or cure
such Environmental Defect to the degree necessary such that such
Environmental Defect no longer constitutes an Environmental Defect as defined
above.

 

(i) Seller shall reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Value,
convey the affected Asset(s) to Buyer and Buyer shall thereafter assume all
liabilities and responsibility related to such Environmental Defect.

(ii) Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
asserted Environmental Defect, together with all other Assets associated with
such Asset, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such excluded Asset.

(iii) In addition to the foregoing rights and remedies set forth in subparts
(i) and (ii) of this Section 5.04, Seller and Buyer will have the termination
rights set forth in Section 13.01.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller (i) for individual asserted Environmental Defects that do
not exceed $75,000.00 (" _Individual Environmental Deductible_ "), which
shall be deemed to be Assumed Obligations, and (ii) until the aggregate amount
of the Environmental Defect Values for all such asserted Environmental Defects
that exceed the Individual Environmental Deductible, excluding any asserted
Environmental Defects cured or disputed by Seller, exceeds one percent (1%) of
the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Environmental Deductible_ "),
after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies elected by Buyer only to the extent the sum of the
Environmental Defect Values for such asserted Environmental Defects exceeds
the Aggregate Environmental Deductible.

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve,
prior to Closing, any disagreement relating to (i) the existence of any
asserted Environmental Defect, or (ii) the Environmental Defect Value
attributable to an Environmental Defect.

 

Section 5.05 _No Warranty Regarding Environmental Matters_. SELLER WILL CONVEY
THE ASSETS TO BUYER WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED,
NOT EVEN FOR RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. BUYERS SOLE REMEDY FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IS THE
ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT PROCEDURE UNDER THIS _ARTICLE V_.

 



25 Section 5.06 _Physical Condition of the Assets_. Buyer acknowledges that
the Assets have been used by Seller for oil and gas drilling and production
operations and related field operations, and that physical changes in the
Assets (or adjacent lands) may have occurred as a result of those uses. In
this regard, the Assets may also contain unplugged or improperly plugged
wells, wellbores or buried pipelines or other equipment, whether or not of a
similar nature, the locations of which may not now be known by Seller or be
readily apparent by a physical inspection of the property.

Section 5.07 _NORM_. Buyer acknowledges that some oilfield production
equipment comprising the Assets may contain asbestos and/or naturally
occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "). In this regard, Buyer
specifically acknowledges that NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside
of wellbores, materials and equipment as scale or in other forms, and that
wells, materials and equipment comprising the Assets or located on a Lease may
contain NORM and that NORM containing materials may have been disposed of on a
Lease. Buyer expressly understands that special procedures may be
required for the removal and disposal of asbestos and NORM from the Assets if
and where they may be found, and Buyer assumes Sellers liability for or in
connection with the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or
disposal of any such materials present on the Assets at or after the
Effective Time in accordance with all requirements of any Governmental
Authority (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM A SELLER INDEMNITEES SOLE, JOINT,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY).

with respect to the ownership and operation (where applicable) by Seller of
the Assets; and

 

(b) All oil or gas wells comprising a part of the Assets have been drilled and

or furnished for use in connection with the Assets) have been, and are being,
paid (timely, and before same become delinquent) by Seller, except such
expenses as are disputed in good faith by Seller and for which an adequate
accounting reserve has been established by Seller.

 

Section 6.19 _Plugging Obligations_. There are no Wells included in the Assets
in respect of which Seller or any of its Affiliates have received an
unresolved order or demand from any Governmental Authority requiring that such
Wells be plugged and abandoned, and, except as set forth on _Schedule 6.19_ ,
to Sellers Knowledge there are no Wells required, as of the Effective Time,
to be plugged pursuant to applicable Laws.

Section 6.20 _No Oral Contracts_. To Sellers Knowledge, Seller has not
entered into any material oral contract with respect to the Assets, which is
still in force and effect.

 



29 Section 6.21 _No Tag Along Rights_. None of the Contracts or other agreements
or instruments comprising or related to the Assets include any provisions
creating tag-along or similar rights in Third Parties to require Buyer to
acquire additional interests from such Third Parties, as result of the

ANYONE, ARISING OUT OF SUCH GAS IMBALANCES REGARDLESS OF A SELLER INDEMNITEES
NEGLIGENCE OR FAULT (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY). 

 



39 Section 14.02 _Final Accounting Statement_.

 

(a) On or before the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a revised Closing Statement setting forth a
detailed calculation of the actual Purchase Price Adjustments (the "
_Accounting Statement_ "). The Accounting Statement shall include any
adjustment or payment which was not finally determined as of the Closing
Date, including any Gas Imbalances, and the allocation of revenues and
expenses as determined in accordance with _Section 12.02_. Seller shall
provide Buyer such data and information as Buyer reasonably may request
supporting the amounts reflected on the Accounting Statement to permit Buyer
to agree to the Accounting Statement. The Accounting Statement shall become
final and binding on the Parties on the 31st day following receipt by Buyer
(the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") unless Buyer gives written notice of its
disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to that date,
and upon such Notice of Disagreement, the Accounting Statement will be final
and binding with respect to all matters other than those specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in detail the
dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice
of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner, then the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disagreement
evidenced by the Notice of Disagreement.

 

(b) If the amount of the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Statement
exceeds the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price as set forth
on the Final Statement exceeds the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid
at the Closing on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Final
Settlement Date. If the amount of the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final
Statement is less than the amount of the estimated Purchase Price paid at the
Closing, then Seller shall refund to Buyer the amount by which the
Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Statement is less than the amount of
the estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing on or before the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the Final Settlement Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Final Statement_ " means the final Accounting Statement as
finalized pursuant to _Section 14.02(a)_.

 

(c) The Parties agree that any and all payments pursuant to this Agreement
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, be treated for all
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 14.03 _Further Cooperation_. Seller shall make the Records available
to be picked up by Buyer at the offices of Seller during normal business hours
within twenty (20) Business Days after the Closing to the extent the Records
are in the possession of Seller and are not subject to contractual
restrictions on transferability. Seller shall have the right to retain copies
of any of the Records and the rights granted under _Section 18.04_.

 



40 Section 14.04 _After the Closing_. After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer,
at the request of the other and without additional consideration, shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to
time such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and shall take such
other action as the other reasonably may request to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, the Parties
will cooperate to have all proceeds received attributable to the Assets be
paid to the proper Party under this Agreement and to have all expenditures to
be made with respect to the Assets be made by the proper Party under this
Agreement. To the extent a Party receives funds after the Closing Date, other
than funds described in and allocated pursuant to _Section 12.02(a)_ or _(b)_
, to which another Party is entitled, the receiving Party will promptly
transfer such funds to the Party so entitled. To the extent a Party receives
any invoice or statement after the Closing Date that is the responsibility of
another Party, the receiving Party will promptly send the invoice or statement
to the appropriate Party.

 

Article XV

Operation of the Assets

Section 15.01 _Operations_. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as expressly
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent will be conclusively presumed
to have been given as of 5:00 p.m. Midland, Texas, time on the third (3rd)
Business Day following notice to Buyer requesting the consent unless Buyer
has notified Seller that it does not consent), or in situations in which
emergency action is taken in the face of risk to life, property or the
environment, Seller shall:

 

(a) Operate, manage and maintain the Subject Interests operated by Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller in the usual, regular and ordinary manner consistent
with past practice;

(b) maintain the books of account and records relating to the Assets in
the usual, regular and ordinary manner, in accordance with its usual
accounting practices;

written notice received or given by Seller with respect to any alleged breach
by Seller or any third party of any Lease or Material Contract or violation of
law or lawsuit or similar claim related to the Assets;

(d) pay all taxes and assessments with respect to the Assets that become due
and payable prior to Closing;

 

(e) except to the extent necessary to maintain a Lease, not enter into a
material Contract, or materially amend or change the terms of any such
Contract that would involve individual commitments of more than $50,000 net to
Sellers interest;

 

(f) Except to the extent necessary or advisable to maintain a Lease or avoid
forfeiture or penalties, not enter into agreements to drill new wells or to
rework, plug back, deepen, plug or abandon any well located on the Leases, nor
commence any

 



41  drilling, reworking or completing or other operations on the Leases which
requires estimated expenditures exceeding $50,000, net to Sellers Interest,
for each operation (except for emergency operations) without obtaining the
prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided that the terms of this paragraph
(c) shall not apply to any expenditures of Seller which will not be charged
to Buyer;

(g) unless required by Law or a Governmental Authority, not plug or abandon
any well located on the Subject Interests that is identified on Exhibit B as
producing;

(h) not transfer, sell, mortgage, farmout, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise
dispose of any material portion of the Subject Interests other than the sale
and/or disposal of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of business and sales
of equipment that is no longer necessary in the operation of the Subject
Interests or for which replacement equipment has been obtained; and

(i) not release, terminate or materially amend any Lease or Easement.

Section 15.02 _Limitations on the Operational Obligations and Liabilities
of Seller_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in some or all of
the Assets, and Buyer agrees that, as long as Seller has voted Sellers
interests in a manner that complies with the provisions of this _Article XV_ ,
the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this _Article XV_, nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation. To the extent that Seller or an Affiliate of Seller is not the
operator of an Asset, the obligations of Seller in this  _Article XV_ shall
be construed to require that Seller use reasonable efforts (without being
obligated to incur any material expense or institute any cause of action) to
cause the operator of that Asset to take such actions or render
such performance within the constraints of the applicable operating
agreements and other applicable agreements.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XV_ , Seller
shall have no liability to Buyer for, and Buyer agrees to release, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Sellers shareholders, partners,
members, managers, Affiliates, co-lessees, co-venturers and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, partners, representatives,
members, shareholders, Affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, heirs and assigns
(collectively, " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from, the incorrect payment of delay
rentals, royalties, shut-in royalties or similar payments (INCLUDING THOSE
RESULTING FROM A SELLER INDEMNITEES SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) to the extent that such payments relate to
periods after the Effective Time. In no event shall Buyers remedy for
Sellers breach of Sellers obligations under this _Article XV_ exceed the
Allocated Value of the Subject Interest affected by such breach.

 



42 Section 15.03 _Operation of the Assets after the Closing_. It is
expressly understood and agreed that Seller shall not be obligated to
continue operating any of the operated Assets following the Closing and Buyer
assumes full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all
such Assets following the Closing. Seller does not warrant or guarantee that
Buyer will become the operator of the operated Assets or any portion of the
Assets, as such matter will be controlled by the applicable joint operating
agreement(s). Without implying any obligation on Sellers part to continue
operating any operated Assets after the Closing, if Seller elects to continue
to operate any such Assets following the Closing at the request of Buyer or
any Third Party working interest owner, due to constraints of applicable
joint operating agreement(s), failure of a successor operator to take over
operations or other reasonable cause, the continued operation by Seller shall
be for the account of Buyer, at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyer.
Buyer releases and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller
Indemnitees, as a part of the Assumed Obligations, from and against all
claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and judgments of
any kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM A SELLER INDEMNITEES
SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) with
respect to (a) continued operations by Seller, (b) Buyers assumption of
operations from Seller, and (c) compliance with the terms of any applicable
joint operating agreement related to the election of a successor operator.

 

Section 15.04 _Change in Circumstances; Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) If Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to,
and any change in the condition of, the Assets from and after the Effective
Time, including with respect to the depletion of Hydrocarbons, the watering-
out of any well, the collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells and damage
to and depreciation of property, including normal wear and tear, except to
the extent that such change in condition results from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Seller.

(b) If after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing any part of the
Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty ("Casualty
Loss") or if any part of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under
the right of eminent domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be
pending or threatened ("Government Takings"), this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or
proceeding, or the threat of any such destruction, taking or proceeding, and
the Parties shall proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such Casualty Loss or Government Taking without reduction of
the Purchase Price, but subject to  _Section 15.04(c)_. Seller shall
maintain its insurance coverage with respect to the Assets from the date of
this Agreement until Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 15.04(a)_, in the event of any loss described in
_Section 15.04(b)_, at the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer all sums paid
to Seller by Third Parties directly by reason of the Casualty Loss or
Government Taking, including any sums paid pursuant to any policy or agreement
of insurance or indemnity, and shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer
all of the rights, title and interest of Seller in and to any claims, causes
of action, unpaid proceeds or other payments from Third Parties, including any
policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity, directly arising out of such
Casualty Loss or Government Taking.

Section 16.05  _Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters_.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 16.05_, the term " _Indemnifying Party_ "
when used in connection with particular Losses shall mean the party or parties
having an obligation to indemnify another party or parties with respect to
such losses pursuant to this Agreement, and the term " _Indemnified Party_ "
when used in connection with particular Losses shall mean the party or parties
having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Losses by another
party or parties pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) To make claim for indemnification under any of _Section 16.03_ or _16.04_
, an Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under
this _Section 16.05_, including the specific details of and specific basis
under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against
the Indemnified Party (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall provide its
Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give timely notice of a Claim as provided in this _Section 16.05_ shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 16.03_ or
_16.04_ (as applicable) only to the extent that failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to defend
effectively against the Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Claim.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of
the Claim Notice, shall notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or
denies its liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and before the expiration of this 30-day period, to file
any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Claim, it
shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost
and expense, the

 



47  Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement of the Claim. If requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this  _Section 16.05_. Without the written consent of the Indemnified Party,
an Indemnifying Party shall not (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to any Claim which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect any Claim in any manner that may materially and
adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to defend the
Claim or admits its liability but fails diligently to prosecute or settle the
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the
Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of
the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Party to admit its liability to defend the Claim and assume the defense of the
Claim at any time prior to its settlement or final determination. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend a Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, on or before the
tenth (10th) day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in writing its
liability to defend the Claim, and (ii) if liability is so admitted, to
reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.

 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (i) to cure the Losses complained of, (ii) to admit its liability for
those Losses, or (iii) to dispute the claim for those Losses. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within this 30-day
period that it has cured the Losses or that it disputes the claim for those
Losses, the amount of those Losses shall conclusively be deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party.

public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall negotiate

as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

Section 18.14 _Survival_. Other than the representations and warranties of
Seller made in Sections 6.01 through 6.06 and by Buyer in Sections 7.01
through 7.06, which shall, in each case, survive the Closing until the

performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 18.15 _Time of the Essence_. Time shall be of the essence with respect
to all time periods and notice periods set forth in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is

Section 18.16 _Counterpart Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (including by facsimile or email transmission), and
each such counterpart shall be effective as to each Party that executes the
same whether or not all of the Parties execute the same counterpart. If

counterparts may be combined into one composite instrument for all purposes.
All counterparts together shall constitute only one Agreement, but each
counterpart shall be considered an original.

 

Section 18.17 _Public Announcements_. No press release or other public
announcement or public disclosure having or containing any reference, either
directly or by implication, to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be made or used by Seller or Buyer, unless the same
first shall have been approved in writing by an authorized officer of the
other Party, except for such disclosure as may be required by applicable laws
or rules and regulation of any governmental agency or stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the Parties or their respective Affiliates. This prohibition
specifically includes, but is not

 



53  limited to, any public release (either through print or broadcast news
media), articles prepared for internal or external publication, technical
papers and discussions with journalists. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer agrees to the fullest extent possible to withhold, redact or otherwise
not disclose the names of the Seller to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the parties listed on _Schedule I_ , in any press release,
announcement, or disclosure.

In furtherance of (and not in limitation of) the foregoing, if either Party is
required to make a press release or other public announcement or disclosure
respecting this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (as
contemplated by clause (a) above) or if either Party wishes to make a non-
required press release or other public announcement or disclosure (whether
contemplated by clause (b) above or otherwise), such Party will provide the
other Party with a draft of such press release or other public announcement or
disclosure for review at least one (1) Business Day prior to the time that
such press release or other public announcement or disclosure is to be made.
The Parties will attempt in good faith to expeditiously reach agreement on
such press release or other public announcement or disclosure and the contents
thereof. Failure by such other Party to provide comments back to the
disclosing Party within one (1) Business Day of receipt of the draft release
or announcement or disclosure will be deemed consent to the issuance of such
press release or other public announcement or disclosure and the contents
thereof.

Section 18.18 _Exclusivity; Waiver of Rescission_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that after Closing, in relation to any breach, default, or
nonperformance of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement made
or entered into by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate,
instrument, or document delivered pursuant hereto or with respect to the
Retained Obligations, the relief and remedy available to Buyer in respect of
said liability, breach, default, or nonperformance shall be limited to the
extent properly claimable hereunder and subject to the terms and provisions of
_Article XVI_.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that, following the Closing, the payment of money, as
limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be
adequate compensation, following the Closing, Buyer waives any right to
rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 18.19 _Several Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, it is agreed that to the extent each separate
party comprising Seller (hereinafter a " _Separate Seller_ ", whether one or
more) shall have liability or responsibility for any obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement or the Assignment, such liability or
responsibility shall be several, and not joint, and shall be borne by such
Separate Seller, such that the percentage of any such liability or obligation
borne by such Separate Seller shall not exceed the percentage obtained by
dividing (x) the undivided working interest owned by such Separate Seller in
the affected Assets, by (y) the sum of the undivided working interest

 



54  owned by all parties comprising Seller in the affected Assets; provided,
however, nothing in this _Section 18.19_ shall release, waive, or otherwise
release Seller from its liabilities and responsibilities as provided in this
Agreement.

Section 18.20 _Waiver of Trade Practices Act_.

 

(a) It is the intention of the parties that Buyers rights and remedies with
respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
PracticesConsumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 et seq.
(the " _DTPA_ "). As such, Buyer hereby waives the applicability of the DTPA
to this transaction and any and all duties, rights or remedies that might be
imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied
directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in connection with other statutes.
Buyer acknowledges, represents and warrants that it is purchasing the goods
and/or services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business use;
that it has assets of $25,000,000 or more according to its most recent
financial statement prepared in accordance with GAAP; that it has knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate
the merits and risks of a transaction such as this; and that it is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position with Seller.

(b) Buyer expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed to
perform Sellers obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Buyer further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to proceed with the entering into this
Agreement, has expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability of the
DTPA.

 

(c) In addition to the foregoing, and in order to ensure compliance with
Texas DTPA Section 17.42(c), Buyer waives all rights it may possess, if any,
under the DTPA with the following certification:

WAIVER OF RIGHTS

 

BUYER WAIVES ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES-CONSUMER
PROTECTION ACT, SECTION 17.41 ET SEQ., BUSINESS and COMMERCE CODE, A LAW THAT
GIVES CONSUMERS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS. AFTER CONSULTATION WITH AN
ATTORNEY OF ITS OWN SELECTION, BUYER VOLUNTARILY CONSENTS TO THIS WAIVER.

 

[REMAINDER OF PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY]

 



55 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Buyer have executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the date first set forth above.
