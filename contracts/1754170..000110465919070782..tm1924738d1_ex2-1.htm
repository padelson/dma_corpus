Surviving Corporation, Monocle or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such

fraction of a share of NewCo Common Stock or NewCo Convertible Preferred Stock
(in each case after aggregating all fractional shares of NewCo Common Stock
or NewCo Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable, that otherwise would be
received by such holder) shall instead have the number of shares of NewCo
Common Stock or NewCo Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued to
such Person rounded up or down to the nearest whole share of NewCo Common
Stock or NewCo Convertible Preferred Stock, as applicable (with 0.5 of a
share or greater rounded up).

or Merger Sub 2, shall apply such cash to pay the Funded Debt under the
Credit Documents and (b) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Borrowers shall procure from the applicable lenders or investors of

survive the termination thereof) upon receipt of the amounts set forth therein
and (ii) in the case of the First Lien Credit Documents, releases in
customary forms concurrently with the repayment of such obligations under the
First Lien Credit Documents of all Liens with respect to the capital stock,
property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to such
Funded Debt.

  



  

4.5 _Exchange Agent_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Funding Amount as directed by Monocle; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
the Holders pursuant to this _Article IV_. Any interest or other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Monocle, upon demand.
Promptly following the date which is twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, Monocle shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Monocle any
remaining portion of the Funding Amount, Letters of Transmittal, Certificates
and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate.
Thereafter, each Holder of a Certificate may look only to Monocle or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration that such Holder may have the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article IV_ without any interest thereon.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

4.6 _Lost Certificate_. In the event any Certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the delivery
of the Letter of Transmittal, and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article IV_.

  



  

4.7 _No Liability; Withholding_.

  



  

(a) None of Monocle, NewCo, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains undistributed to the Holders as of immediately prior to the date
on which the Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(b) Each of Monocle, NewCo, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Holder pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under any applicable Law. Any
amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made. Without limitation of the foregoing, such
withholding (i) with respect to the payments to Holders of In-the-Money SARs
described in _Sections 4.1(b)(iii)(A)_ and _4.1(c)(iii)(A)_ , as applicable,
shall be deducted solely from the cash payments described in _Sections
4.1(b)(iii)(A)(x)_ and _4.1(c)(iii)(A)(x)_ , respectively (and, to the extent
such cash payments are insufficient to satisfy any such required withholding,
any additional withholding shall be deducted from the applicable Holder's
first payroll payment (and, if necessary, any subsequent payroll payments)
from the Surviving Corporation or its applicable Affiliate that is on or
following the Effective Time in accordance with such Surviving Corporation's
or Affiliate's ordinary payroll procedures), and (ii) with respect to any
issuance of Earnout Shares to Holders of In-the-Money SARs (as described in
_Section 4.8_ ) may be effectuated through any means established by NewCo and
reasonably acceptable to the Holder Representative, including, without
limitation, requiring cash payment of any such withholding by such Holders to
the NewCo for remittance to the applicable Governmental Authority, a "net
settlement" (or "cashless" settlement) procedure through which NewCo
withholds a number of Earnout Shares from such Holder with a value equal to
the applicable required withholding, additional payroll deductions for such
withholding from any other compensation payable by NewCo or its Affiliates to
such Holder, or any combination of the foregoing, in each case subject to
applicable Law.

the Closing Date (the " _Earnout Period_ "), upon the occurrence of any of
the following, NewCo shall issue up to an additional two million five hundred
thousand (2,500,000) shares of NewCo Common Stock (the " _Earnout Shares_ ")
to the Holders of Common Shares and the Holders of In-the-Money SARs that
received a contingent right to receive Earnout Shares pursuant to _Section
4.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 4.1(b)(iii)_, respectively (collectively, the "
_Earnout Holders_ "), as additional consideration for the Second Merger,
fully paid and free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens or
Liens pursuant to any Contract to which an Earnout Holder is or may become a
party:

  



  

   

31

 



    



  

(i) if the NewCo Common Stock Price is greater than twelve
dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) (such share price as adjusted pursuant
to this _Section 4.8_ , the " _Minimum Target_ ") for any period of twenty
(20) trading days out of thirty (30) consecutive trading days, one million
two hundred fifty thousand (1,250,000) shares of NewCo Common Stock (the "

such Earnout Shares promptly and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date the Earnout Holders become entitled thereto. The Earnout
Shares to be issued to the Earnout Holders hereunder, if any, when delivered,
shall be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable,
and issued in compliance with all applicable state and federal securities
Laws and not subject to, and not issued in violation of, any options,

cash or in-kind dividend (other than any dividend in the form of additional
shares of NewCo Common Stock, which dividend shall be governed by the
immediately following sentence) on shares of NewCo Common Stock, then in each
such case the Minimum Target (to the extent the Minimum Target Earnout Shares
have not already been issued prior to the time of such dividend) and the
Maximum Target (to the extent the Maximum Target Earnout Shares have not
already been issued prior to the time of such dividend) shall be deemed to
have been reduced for all purposes of this Agreement by the amount of such
cash dividend or the fair market value of the in-kind dividend, as applicable,
paid with respect to each share of NewCo Common Stock. If NewCo shall at any
time during the Earnout Period pay any dividend on shares of NewCo Common
Stock by the issuance of additional shares of NewCo Common Stock, or effect a
subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of
NewCo Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or
lesser number of shares of NewCo Common Stock, then in each such case, (i) the
number of Earnout Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of NewCo Common
Stock (including any other shares so reclassified as NewCo Common Stock)
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of NewCo Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to such event, and (ii) the NewCo Common Stock Price values set forth in
_Section 4.8(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ above shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the Earnout Holders the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

Period:

  



  

(i) if the Liquidity Event Consideration in such Liquidity
Event is greater than the Minimum Target (but less than the Maximum
Target) and the Minimum Target Earnout Shares have not already been issued,
then the Minimum Target Earnout Shares shall be deemed issued and outstanding
pursuant to and as contemplated by _Section 4.8(a)(i)_ and _Section 4.8(d)_ ,
effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Liquidity Event and
the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the corresponding Liquidity
Event Consideration; or

  



  

(ii) if the Liquidity Event Consideration in such Liquidity
Event is greater than the Maximum Target and the Maximum Target Earnout
Shares have not already been issued, then the Minimum Target Earnout Shares
(to the extent not already issued) and the Maximum Target Earnout Shares
shall be issued, and the Maximum Target Earnout Shares and the Minimum Target
Earnout Shares shall be deemed issued and outstanding pursuant to and as
contemplated by _Section 4.8(a)_ and _Section 4.8(d)_ or _Section 4.8(e)_ ,
as applicable, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such
Liquidity Event and the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the
corresponding Liquidity Event Consideration.

substantially all of NewCo's assets;

  



  

(iii) The stockholders of NewCo approve a plan of complete
liquidation or dissolution of NewCo; or

foregoing clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) following which the voting securities
of NewCo outstanding immediately prior thereto are no longer traded on a
national securities exchange or registered under Section 12(b) or (g) of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(i) " _Liquidity Event Consideration_ " means the amount per share
to be received by a holder of shares of NewCo Common Stock in connection with

Documents and/or the liquidation of Monocle, (y) to Monocle after, or
concurrently with, the consummation of a Business Combination, and (z) to
Monocle in limited amounts for its operating expenses and Tax obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.
The Company and the Company Stockholders further acknowledge that, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or, upon termination of this
Agreement, another Business Combination) are not consummated by November 11,
2020, Monocle will be obligated to return to the Pre-Closing Monocle Holders
the amounts being held in the Trust Account, unless such date is
otherwise extended. Upon the Closing, Monocle shall cause the Trust Account
to be disbursed to Monocle and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, the Company and the Company Stockholders, for each of themselves
and their respective subsidiaries, affiliated entities, directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, representatives, advisors and all other associates
and Affiliates, hereby waive all rights, title, interest or claim of any kind
to collect from the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by
Monocle for any reason whatsoever, including for a breach of this Agreement by
Monocle or any negotiations, agreements or understandings with Monocle
(whether in the past, present or future), and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever, in each case except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's right to pursue a claim
against Monocle for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust
Account, for specific performance or other equitable relief, and (ii) nothing
herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company may have
in the future against Monocle's assets or funds that are not held in the
Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from the Trust
Account and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such
funds). This paragraph will survive the termination of this Agreement for any
reason.

7.10 _Section 280G_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Monocle, at least three (3) days prior to
the Closing, a parachute payment waiver (each, a " _Parachute Payment Waiver_
") from each Person who the Company reasonably believes is a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), pursuant to which such disqualified
individuals will waive any and all payments or other benefits contingent on
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the
extent necessary so that no payment received (or retained) by such
disqualified individual shall be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G
of the Code (the " _Waived Payments_ "). To the extent such waivers are
obtained, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the approval by such number of its shareholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of the right of such disqualified
individuals to receive the Waived Payments, with such vote to be obtained in a
manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to seeking any
such Parachute Payment Waiver or shareholder approval, the Company shall
deliver to Monocle drafts of all waivers, consents, disclosures, supporting
calculations, and other documents prepared in connection with such
contemplated actions, and Monocle shall have a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on all such documents (the Company's acceptance
of Monocle's reasonable comments shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters; Information Updates_. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Monocle of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may
be, could reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in _Section
10.2_ not to be satisfied at any time from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time; (b) any notice or other communication from any third Person
alleging that the consent of such third Person is or may be required in
connection with the Second Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (c) any regulatory notice, report or results of inspection
from a Governmental Authority in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (d) any information or knowledge obtained by the Company
that could reasonably be expected to materially affect the Company's current
projections, forecasts or budgets or estimates of revenues, earnings or other
measures of financial performance for any period. The Company shall prepare in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and deliver to
the Monocle Parties promptly upon completion and promptly following any
delivery to the members of the Company Board or to any of the Company
Stockholders (but in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the end of
the applicable fiscal month) unaudited consolidated financial statements for
the Company and its Subsidiaries for each fiscal month ending after the date
hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, December 2019), together with a
copy of the standard monthly reporting package provided to the management of
the Company.

  



  

7.12 _Expense Report; Company Transaction Expenses_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall prepare and submit to Monocle no later than
two (2) Business Days prior the Closing Date a final calculation of all

immediately available funds all such Company Transaction Expenses.

Order on appeal or otherwise; (iii) materially delay the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in _Section 10.1_ ; or (iv) otherwise prevent or delay

8.3 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Monocle Parties agree that all rights held by each
present and former director and officer of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time, provided in the respective
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the
Company or such Subsidiary in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect. Without
limiting the foregoing, (i) Monocle shall cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (A) to maintain for a period of not less than six (6) years from
the Effective Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
other organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' former and current officers, directors, employees, and
agents that are no less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other organizational documents of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date
of this Agreement and (B) not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any respect that would adversely affect the rights of those
Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by Law and (ii) Monocle
agrees that any indemnification and advancement of expenses available to
any current or former director of the Company or its Subsidiaries by virtue
of such current or former director's service as a partner or employee of any
investment fund that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (any
such current or former director, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall be secondary
to the indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by Monocle,
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and
that Monocle, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (A) be the primary
indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this _Section
8.3_, (B) be fully responsible for the advancement of all expenses and the
payment of all Damages with respect to Sponsor Directors which are addressed
by this _Section 8.3_ and (C) not make any claim for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect of any other
indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with respect to any matter
addressed by this _Section 8.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 8.3(a)_ shall not apply to claims made against or Damages or
advancement of expenses sought by, a Sponsor Director to the extent arising
under or in connection with a claim by LGP, any Affiliate or investment fund
of LGP or any of its or their respective limited or general partners. Monocle
shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 8.3_.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Monocle
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered
by the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have
been heretofore made available to Monocle or its agents or representatives) on
terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Monocle may, at its sole cost and
expense, cause coverage to be extended under the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy
containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within
such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained under this
_Section 8.3_ shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final
disposition thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not pay,
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay, in excess of two
hundred fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy, and if
such premiums for such insurance are in excess of two hundred fifty percent
(250%), then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies
of insurance, which, in its good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this _Section 8.3_ shall survive the consummation of the
Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Monocle and the Surviving Corporation. In the event
that Monocle or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Monocle or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.3_.

  



  

8.4 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Monocle Parties shall use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, as
promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiating and entering into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter so that such agreements are in effect as promptly as
practicable but in any event not later than at Closing (such definitive
financing agreements entered into in respect of the Financing, the "
_Financing Agreements_ ") and (iii) arranging and obtaining the proceeds of
the Financing at or before Closing on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Commitment Letter. Promptly upon request, Monocle shall provide
to the Company copies of all material definitive documents relating to the
Financing, including the Financing Agreements, and shall keep the Company
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of material developments
in respect of the financing process relating thereto, including by from time
to time advising the Company of the status of the Financing.

  



  

(b) Monocle shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a breach
or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which any Monocle
Party becomes aware, (ii) if and when any Monocle Party becomes aware that any
portion of the Financing may not be available to consummate the Second
Merger, (iii) of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary
course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing), (iv) if for
any reason any Monocle Party believes in good faith it will not be able to
obtain any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and (v) of any termination
of the Debt Commitment Letter. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Monocle Parties shall, without limiting the
obligations of the Monocle Parties set forth in the immediately
following sentence, use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms in the
aggregate not materially less favorable to Monocle than the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and the
provisions of _Section 7.4_, this _Section 8.4_ and _Section 13.15_ shall
be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes of _Section
7.4_, this _Section 8.4_ and _Section 13.15_, all references to the Debt
Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing, all
references to the Debt Commitment Letter shall include the applicable
documents for the Alternative Financing and all references to the Debt
Financing Sources shall include the persons providing or arranging the
Alternative Financing. The Monocle Parties shall (A) comply in all material
respects with the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) enforce in all material
respects their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (C) not permit,
without the prior written consent of the Company, any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would
(1) reduce the aggregate amount of proceeds from the Financing available to
fund the amounts required to be paid by any Monocle Party under this Agreement
below the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) impose new or additional, or otherwise expand any,
conditions precedent to the receipt of the Financing or (3) otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability
of the Monocle Parties to consummate the Mergers.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

8.5 _Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records_. From and after
the Closing and to the extent consistent with all applicable Laws, Monocle
will make or cause to be made available to the Holder Representative all
books, records and documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (and
the assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and documents)
during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary solely for (a)
investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Action involving stockholders of the Company
(other than any Action against Monocle or any of its Affiliates, including
the Company and its Subsidiaries, that relates to the subject matter hereof),
or (b) preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement provided
for under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that access to such books,
records, documents and employees shall be conducted in a manner reasonably
calculated to minimize disruptions with the normal operation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries incurred in connection therewith will be paid by
the Holder Representative. Monocle will cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve all such books, records and other
documents for any applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the
same may be extended and, in each case, shall offer to transfer such records
to the Holder Representative at the end of any such period.

  



  

8.6 _Monocle Public Filings_. From the date hereof through the
Closing, Monocle will keep current and timely file all reports required to be
filed or furnished with the SEC and otherwise comply in all material respects
with its reporting obligations under applicable Laws.

  



  

8.7 _Nasdaq Listing_. From the date hereof through the First
Merger Closing, Monocle shall take reasonable efforts to ensure
Monocle remains listed as a public company, and for shares of Monocle Common
Stock to be listed, on Nasdaq. Monocle and NewCo shall take reasonable
efforts to ensure that NewCo is listed as a public company, and for shares of
NewCo Common Stock to be listed, on Nasdaq as of the First Merger Effective
Time.

  



  

8.8 _Additional Covenants_. NewCo shall (i) immediately following
the Effective Time, contribute, transfer, convey and assign all of the equity
interests of Monocle then-held by NewCo to Parent and (ii) immediately
following the contribution described in the foregoing clause (i), cause
Parent to contribute, transfer, convey and assign all of the equity interests
of Monocle then-held by Parent to the Surviving Corporation, such that
Monocle will be a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation,
in each case, pursuant to a contribution agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Holder Representative.

covenant contained in _Article VII_ or _Article VIII_ , including the

to dissent from the Merger or to demand fair value for such Company
Stockholders' equity securities of the Company in connection with the Merger,
in each case to the extent applicable and (ii) the Company, making available
to Monocle for use in connection with, and contingent upon, the Closing, the

to cooperate and timely prepare any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer
Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or

(c) Each of the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
not to take an action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Mergers

") and (ii) the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Monocle or NewCo, the Company and the Holder
Representative agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and

or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the Mergers, and
each of the Company and the Holder Representative shall promptly furnish all
information concerning the Company as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. Each of Monocle, NewCo, the Company and the
Holder Representative agrees to use reasonable best efforts to promptly
furnish to each other party all information concerning itself, its

Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed,
of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of
the Monocle Common Stock or the NewCo Common Stock for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, of the initiation or written threat of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
supplement of the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the other
Offer Documents or for additional information.

  



  

(c) Each of Monocle, NewCo, the Company and the Holder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that none
of the information related to it or any of its Affiliates, supplied by or on
its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) either Proxy
Statement will, as of the date it is first mailed to the Pre-Closing Monocle
Holders, or at the time of the Monocle Stockholders' Meeting, or (B) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed
with the SEC, at each time at which it is amended, at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act and at the Effective Time, in either case,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

  



  

(d) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, in the case of the
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement any information relating to
Monocle, NewCo or the Company any of their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors or officers, as applicable, or the Company Stockholders
is discovered by any of Monocle, NewCo or the Company and is required to be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to either Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, so that such Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall, subject
to the other provisions of this _Section 9.3_ , be promptly filed by Monocle
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the Pre-

hold, and convene a special meeting of holders of Monocle Common Stock
(including any permitted adjournment or postponement, the " _Monocle
Stockholders ' Meeting_") to consider and vote upon the Merger Proposals and
to provide its stockholders with the opportunity to effect an Monocle Share
Redemption in connection therewith as promptly as reasonably practicable after

Meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies because
there are not sufficient votes to approve and adopt any of the foregoing (such
proposals in (A) through (F), together, the " _Merger Proposals_ "). The
Merger Proposals shall be the only matters which Monocle shall propose to be
acted on at the Monocle Stockholders Meeting.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, once the Monocle Stockholders' Meeting to consider and vote upon
the Merger Proposals has been called and noticed, Monocle will not postpone

Days each time, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Monocle has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, is
necessary under applicable Law, and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by the holders of Monocle
Common Stock prior to the Monocle Stockholders' Meeting, or (iii) a one-time
postponement of up to ten (10) Business Days to solicit additional proxies
from holders of Monocle Common Stock to the extent Monocle has determined in
good faith that such postponement is reasonably necessary to obtain the
approval of the Merger Proposals. Subject to _Section 9.4(a)_ , Monocle will
take all reasonable lawful action to solicit approval of the Merger Proposals
by the holders of Monocle Common Stock.

responding to such direction or taking such action. The Holder Representative
shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its
powers and performing its functions hereunder and (in the absence of bad

provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid

intent of the parties.

  



  

13.14 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 13.14(b)_ , any Action based upon, arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
may be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or, in
the case of claims to which the federal courts have exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America sitting in
the State of Delaware), and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any
objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any Party to serve process in any
manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 13.14_.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (AND IN THE CASE OF MONOCLE, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF
AND EACH OF THE MONOCLE PARTIES) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or
support any Person in any Action of any kind or description, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Debt Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum
other than the federal and New York state courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan within the City of New York, and (ii) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to
_Section 13.14(a)_.

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

13.15 _Enforcement_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their respective
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, without proof of Damages or inadequacy of any remedy
at law, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 11.1_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and without that right, neither the Company nor Monocle would have entered
into this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the
other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 13.15(b)_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such injunction.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Debt
Financing Party shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
the Parties hereto or for any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description whether in law or in equity,
whether in tort, contract or otherwise, based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby or by the commitments of such Debt
Financing Party or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith or therewith. In no event shall the Company or
any Company Related Party, and the Company agrees not to and to cause the
Company Related Parties not to, (i) seek to enforce this Agreement against,
make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover
monetary damages from, any Debt Financing Party in connection with this
Agreement or (ii) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims
for breach of the commitments of such Debt Financing Party against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the Debt Financing Party in
connection with this Agreement or the commitments of such Debt
Financing Party or the obligations of Debt Financing Party thereunder.
Nothing in this _Section 13.15(c)_ shall affect the rights of the Monocle
Parties and the Surviving Corporation under the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive documentation in respect of the Debt Financing.

  



  

13.16 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under _Section 13.15_, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only
be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under _Section 13.15_, except to the extent a
named party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (a) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (b) no past, present or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative
or Affiliate of any of the foregoing, in each case of the Persons described
in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Monocle under this Agreement
(whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based on,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

13.17 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

  



  

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the
Holder Representative and the Company have retained LandW to act as
their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
that LandW has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the

as a result of LandW's representation of the Company and the Holder
Representative related to the preparation for, and negotiation and
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all communications among LandW and the Company, the Holders, the Holder
Representatives and/or their respective Affiliates, related to the preparation
for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by

(b) Each of the Monocle Parties and the Company agree that,
notwithstanding any current or prior representation of the Company by
LandW, LandW shall be allowed to represent any Holder, the Holder Representative
or any of their respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to
any of the Monocle Parties or the Company that either is existing on the date
of this Agreement or arises in the future and relates to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby; and each of the Monocle Parties and
the Company hereby waive any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise
in connection with such representation. Further, each of the Monocle Parties
and the Company agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing
between any of the Monocle Parties or the Company, on the one hand, and any
Holder, the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the other hand, LandW may represent such Holder, the Holder Representative or
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Holder, the
Holder Representative or Affiliate may be directly adverse to any Monocle
Party or the Company and even though LandW may have represented the Company in
a matter substantially related to such dispute.

  



  

   

96

 



    



  

(c) Each of the Monocle Parties acknowledges, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries), that any advice given to or communication with any Holder,
the Holder Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (other than
the Company) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned
solely by such Holder, the Holder Representative and any Affiliate of each
such party (other than the Company). Each of the Monocle Parties and the
Company each hereby acknowledge that each of them have had the opportunity to
discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers,
permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than LandW.

Monocle Parties have retained CWandT to act as their counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and that CWandT has not acted as counsel
for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby

and the Company agree that any attorney-client privilege and the expectation
of client confidence attaching as a result of CWandT's representation of the
Monocle Parties related to the preparation for, and negotiation and
consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all communications among CWandT and the Monocle Parties and/or their respective
