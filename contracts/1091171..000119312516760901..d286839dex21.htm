Incorporation of the Company as amended (the "Charter"), will be amended and
restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate

-20- 2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following will occur:

 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate
representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will
thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $40.75, without
interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.11); and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (1) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (2) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (3) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who
shall have neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly exercised
their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Company Shares") will not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company
Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company
Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company

 



-21-  Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 2.9.

 

(ii) The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares. Parent shall have the right to control all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company may
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such
demands in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Parent and the Company, at the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Stock Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
and will become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to (i) the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) (1) with respect
to Company Restricted Stock Units that are only subject to time-vesting
requirements, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Unit and (2) with respect to Company Restricted
Stock Units that are subject to time- and performance-vesting requirements,
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock determined to be
performance vested with the performance goals deemed achieved at maximum
levels and with the remaining time-vesting requirements deemed satisfied (in
all cases, the "Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration"). The payment of
the Company Restricted Stock Unit Consideration will be subject to withholding
for all required Taxes.

 

(b) _Company Options_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parent and
the Company, at the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof)
that is outstanding, whether vested or unvested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is an In-the-Money Company Option will, without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the Per Share
Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Option);
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the "Option
Consideration"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
all Company Options that are not In-the-Money Company Options will be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. The payment
of the Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required
Taxes.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. No later than the second payroll cycle of the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the applicable holders of Company
Restricted Stock Units and In-the-Money Company Options, through its payroll
system or payroll provider, all amounts required to be paid to such holders
in 

 



-22-  respect of such Company Restricted Stock Units or In-the-Money Company
Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and
Section 2.8(b), as applicable. All such payments will be less any applicable
withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a
holder of Company Restricted Stock Units or In-the-Money Company Options
pursuant to Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.8(b), as applicable, cannot be made
through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations payroll system or payroll
provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment
to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier to such
holder promptly following the time the applicable payments that are made
through the payroll system. All such payments will be less any applicable
withholding Taxes.

 

(d) _Further Actions_. The Company will pass resolutions necessary to effect
the cancellation and exchange, as applicable, of Company Restricted Stock
Units and Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this
Section 2.8 (including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), and except as otherwise mutually agreed
by the Parties as provided in Section 2.8(a) through Section 2.8(a), terminate
all Company Restricted Stock Units, all Company Options and all Company Stock
Plans as of the Effective Time, and terminate the provisions in any other
Employee Plan, Contract or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant or
vesting of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time without any liability to
Parent, the Company, and Merger Sub. The Company will ensure that, following
the Effective Time, no participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Employee
Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the Companys
2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board will adopt resolutions
or take all other actions as may be required to provide that (i) no new
participants will commence participation after the date of this Agreement;
(ii) no participant will be allowed to increase his or her payroll
contribution rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement or make separate
non-payroll contributions on or following the date of this Agreement; (iii)
no new Offering (as defined in the ESPP), Purchase Period or purchase period
will commence or be extended pursuant to the ESPP, in each case, after the
date of this Agreement; and (iv) the ESPP will terminate, in accordance with
its terms, no later than immediately prior to and effective as of the
Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the Merger).

 

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a payment
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Payment Agent.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.7, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock have become 

 



-23-  entitled pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the
Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i)
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (1) there are any
losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (2) the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent
to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to Section 2.7; or (3) all or
any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the Payment
Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts owed pursuant to
Section 2.7 for any reason, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange
Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times fully available
for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent
to make the payments owed pursuant to Section 2.7. Any income from investment
of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as Parent directs.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time) of (1) a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (2) uncertificated shares of Company
Common Stock that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the
"Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates
so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (I) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated
Shares; by (II) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes
payable in respect thereof), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept such Certificates
and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the 

 



-24-  Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per
Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c). Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder
of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per
Share Price.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the Per
Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer
books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or established
to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such
transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the
applicable Per Share Price with respect to Uncertificated Shares will only be
made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time
will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the
Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any

 



-25-  claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to Section 2.7. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares two years after the Effective Time, or
at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority,
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders (and their successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously
entitled thereto.

 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company
Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The Per Share Price paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to
compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such
amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or
Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.13 _No Dividends or Distributions_ _._ No dividends or other distributions
with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date
on or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 



-26- 2.14 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of
the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
take all such lawful and necessary action.

organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and
(b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as
it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties
and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in
the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), each as amended to date. The Company is
not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform
its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving the

delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this

 



-27-  Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability (1) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors rights generally; and (2) is subject to general principles of
equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

3.3  _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the "Company Board
Recommendation"), which Company Board Recommendation has not been withdrawn,

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received the written
opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial
advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated (the "Advisor"),
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject
to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Per Share
Price to be received in the Merger by the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant
to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders
(it being understood and agreed that such written opinion is for the benefit
of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

 

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" law will not be applicable to the Merger.

 

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote to adopt this Agreement (the "Requisite
Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Company Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the
Charter or the Bylaws to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws; (b) violate, conflict with,
result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice

termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right
of termination or acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.6 and, in the
case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective
properties or assets are bound; or (d) result in the creation of any lien
(other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses
(b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or liens that would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing, a "Consent") any Governmental Authority is required on the part of

Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) the consummation of the

Governmental Authorities to satisfy the applicable laws of states in which

each Company SEC Report did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the

maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" and "internal control over
financial reporting" (in

 



-32-  each case as defined pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated
under the Exchange Act). The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all (i) material information required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports and other documents that it files
or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC; and (ii) such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, and such
assessment concluded that such system was effective. The Companys independent

circumstances have occurred such that management would not be able to complete
its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system was
effective. Since December 30, 2013, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal
executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing of such certifications.

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls that are effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures that (i) require the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of the Companys management and the
Company Board; and (iii) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm has
identified or been made aware of (1) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the system of internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries that has not been subsequently
remediated; or (2) any fraud or alleged fraud that involves the Companys
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
with respect to the Company SEC Reports.

Governmental Authority because it has received funding to develop such Company
Intellectual Property from a Governmental Authority. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is now or has ever been a member or promoter of, or a
contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar organization that
would reasonably be expected to require or obligate the Company or any
Subsidiary to grant or offer to any other Person any license or other right
to any material Company Intellectual Property.

(g) _No Infringement_. To the Knowledge of the Company, the operation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as such business currently is
conducted (including the manufacture and sale of the Companys and its

infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate (and has not, since December
30, 2013, infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated) the Intellectual

material to the business. Without limiting the foregoing, since January 1,
2013, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in place a practice
requiring each officer, employee, consultant _,_  independent contractor, or
other personnel engaged in the development of any material Intellectual
Property or technology for the Company or its Subsidiaries to execute a
proprietary information and confidentiality agreement, which, to the
extent permitted by Law, assigns ownership of all material Intellectual
Property developed or created by such personnel for the Company or its
Subsidiaries under the applicable agreement to the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

in all material respects with such policies and any applicable laws (including
both U.S. and foreign), rules and regulations of Governmental Authorities
pertaining to data privacy and data security (including those relating to the
cross-border transfer, handling, or processing of any Personal Information).
Since December 30, 2013, to the Knowledge of the Company, except as would not

custody or control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December
30, 2013, to the Knowledge of the Company, except as would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not been required to give notice to any customer, supplier,

(collectively, the "Company Systems") are sufficient in all material respects
for the current needs of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have not disclosed, delivered, licensed or
otherwise made available, and do not have a duty or obligation (whether
present, contingent, or otherwise) to disclose, deliver, license, or
otherwise make available, any source code that embodies material Company
Intellectual Property to any Person other than consultants bound by non-

are true, correct, and complete except as would not, individually or in the

adequate reserves have been established on the face of the Audited Company
Balance Sheet (as opposed to the notes thereto and in accordance with GAAP)
through the date of the Audited Company Balance Sheet. The most recent

provision of state, local or non-United States law) as a transferee or
successor, or otherwise by operation of law.

(g) _Income Inclusion_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will
be required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any item of

responsible for administering Taxes outside of the U.S. All Tax Incentives
enjoyed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been in compliance with
all applicable laws and are not subject to reduction, revocation,
cancellation, or any other changes (including retroactive changes) in the
future, except through published changes to applicable law. No written notice

beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m.,
Eastern time, on December 6, 2016 (the "Go-Shop Period End Date"), the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors (collectively,
"Representatives") may (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or encourage, facilitate or assist, any
proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person that has entered into an

in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal or
inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal

The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following the Go-
Shop Period End Date provide Parent a list of Excluded Parties, including
the identity of each Excluded Party and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal
and any related documents submitted by such Person on the basis of which the
Company Board made the determination that such Person shall be an Excluded
Party. For the avoidance of doubt, at any time after the Go-Shop Period End
Date and until the date which is ten days after the Go-Shop Period End Date
(the "Cut-off Date"), the Company may continue to engage in the activities
described in this Section 5.3(a) with respect to, and the restrictions in
Section 5.3(b) shall not apply to, any Excluded Party (but only for so long as
such Person or group is an Excluded Party), including with respect to any
amended or modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party
following the Go-Shop Period End Date.

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation._ Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(c),
except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for so long as such
Person or group of Persons is an Excluded Party) until the Cut-off Date, after
the Go-Shop Period End Date, until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the
Company will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person and its

 



-57-  Representatives that would be prohibited by this Section 5.3(b), request the
prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any such Person and will
(i) cease providing any further information with respect to the Company or any
Acquisition Proposal to any such Person or its Representatives and financing
sources; and (ii) terminate all access granted to any such Person and its
Representatives to any physical or electronic data room. Subject to the terms
of Section 5.3(c), except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for so
long as such Person or group of Persons is an Excluded Party) until the Cut-
off Date, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors and
officers will not, and the Company will not instruct, authorize or knowingly
permit any of its or its Subsidiaries other respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (1) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making,
submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist,
any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal; (2) furnish to any Person (other than to Parent,
Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to
any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or
Merger Sub), in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission
or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (3) participate,
engage in or continue discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or inquiry that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than informing such Persons
of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3 and clarifying the terms of
such an Acquisition Proposal); (4) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (5) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an
Acquisition Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); (6) waive the
applicability of all or any portion of any anti-takeover Laws in respect of
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates); or (7) resolve or agree to
take any of the foregoing actions.

(c) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in
this Section 5.3, except as may relate to any Excluded Party (but only for so
long as such Person or group of Persons is an Excluded Party) until the Cut-
off Date, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the Companys receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board may,
directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including
the Advisor), participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
to any Person or its Representatives that has made or delivered to the Company
a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement,
or otherwise facilitate or assist such Acquisition Proposal or assist such
Person (and its Representatives and financing sources) with such Acquisition
Proposal (in each case, if requested by such Person), in each case with
respect to an 

 



-58-  Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of Section
5.3(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions contemplated
by this Section 5.3(c) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law; and _provided further_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) make available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was
not previously made available to Parent.

(d) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(e), at no time
after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board :

(i) (1) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (2) adopt, approve,
endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal;
(3) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation following the
public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal within five Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing (it being understood that the Company will have
no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two separate occasions);
(4) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal until the close of business on the 10th Business Day after
the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
Section 5.3); or (5) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (1) through (5), a "Company
Board Recommendation Change"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the
avoidance of doubt, none of (A) the determination by the Company Board that
an Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal or (B) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice
contemplated by Section 5.3(e) will, in and of itself, constitute a Company
Board Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 



-59- (i) other than in connection with a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal (which, for the avoidance of doubt, is
governed exclusively by clause (ii) below), the Company Board may effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to any effect, event,
development, occurrence or change in circumstances with respect to the
Company that (A) was not known to the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement and (B) does not relate to any Acquisition Proposal (each such
event, an "Intervening Event"), if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law and
if and only if:

 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so
determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(i), which notice will describe the applicable
Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such five Business Day period, must have
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable law; or

 

(ii) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (y) authorize and cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case if and only if:

 

(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law;

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this Section 5.3 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

(3) (A) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that the Company
Board has (I) received a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn; (II) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (III) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
5.3(e)(ii) absent any revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
which notice will describe the basis for such Company Board Recommendation
Change or termination in reasonable detail, including the identity of the
Person or "group" of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms thereof and copies of all material documents relating to such
Acquisition Proposal; and (B) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives,
during the Notice Period, must have negotiated with Parent

 



-60-  and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to
so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any material
revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (it being
understood that the "Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice will
be two Business Days); and

 

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h),
including paying the Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section
8.3(b)(iii).

The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to modify the
terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required by applicable Law to be disclosed in any
Company SEC Reports.

(f)  _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective
Time, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent if any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute, or are
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any
non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations
are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the Person or
"group" of Persons making such offers or proposals and (ii) a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such offers or proposals. Thereafter, the
Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status
and terms of any such offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following a determination by the
Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, notify
Parent of such determination.

 

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
including a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing
any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3;
or (iv) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) that the Company Board has determined to make in good faith
in order to comply with applicable law, it being understood that any such
statement or disclosure made by the Company Board pursuant to this Section
5.3(g) must be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will
not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company
Board and the rights of Parent under this Section 5.3, it being
understood that nothing in

 



-61-  the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Company Board to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with
Section 5.3(e). Any disclosure by the Company or the Company Board relating
to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(h) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any breach of this
Section 5.3 by any of its Representatives that, if taken by the Company,
would be a breach of this Section 5.3, then such action will be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.

 

(i) _Waiver._ The Company may waive or fail to enforce any standstill or
similar provision in any confidentiality or other agreement it has entered
into with any Person, whether prior to or after the date hereof, solely in
order to permit non-public Alternative Proposals to be made to the Company
Board and otherwise only, if in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law.

Company, on the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts
(x) to take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (y) do (or cause to be done)
all things; and (z) assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or
causing to be done) all things, in each case as are necessary, proper or
advisable pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including
by:

(i) using its reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VII to be satisfied;

(ii) using its reasonable best efforts to (1) obtain all consents, waivers,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities; and (2)
make all registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Authorities, in each case that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
Merger; and

 

(iii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, waivers and
approvals and delivering all notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to
seek to maintain and preserve the benefits to the Surviving Corporation of
such Material Contracts as of and following the consummation of the Merger. 

 



-62- (b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neither Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of (i) preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger; or
(ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with Section 5.3 will be considered a violation of this Section
6.1.

(c) _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company,
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the

(including increased or accelerated payments), or the provision of additional
security (including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in
connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) _Filing Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on
the one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates, if applicable), on the
other hand, will, to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel
to Parent and the Company, (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust
Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement
and the Merger as required by the HSR Act within 10 Business Days following
the date of this Agreement; and (ii) promptly file comparable pre-merger or
post-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental
Authority pursuant to other applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the
Merger, with the Parent having primary responsibility for the making of such
filings. Each of Parent and the Company will (A) cooperate and coordinate
(and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with the
other in the making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause the other
to be supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make
such filings; (C) supply (or cause the other to be supplied) any additional
information that may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any
such filing is made; and (D) use reasonable best efforts to (1) cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger; and (2) obtain
any required consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger,
in each case as soon as practicable. If any Party or Affiliate thereof
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such Party will
make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

(b) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to), subject to any restrictions under applicable Laws, (i)
promptly notify the other parties hereto of, and, if in writing, furnish the
others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
others of the contents of) any material communication received by such Person
from a Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and permit the
other parties to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith
any comments made by the other parties in relation to) any proposed draft
notifications, formal notifications, filing, submission or other substantive
written communication (and any analyses, memoranda, white papers,
presentations, correspondence or other

 



-63-  documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and any material, substantive
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
respect thereof, including with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action,
action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any
waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of
any investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or
proceeding under applicable Laws and (D) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger; and (iii) not independently participate
in any substantive meeting, hearing, proceeding or discussions (whether in
person, by telephone or otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority
in respect of the Merger without giving the other parties reasonable prior
notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. However,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may designate any non-public
information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside
counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with employees,
officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party without approval
of the party providing the non-public information;  _provided, however_ ,
that before sharing any information provided to any Governmental Authority
with another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub may redact any information (A) to remove references
concerning valuation of the Company, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly (and in no event later than 15 Business Days)
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy
Statement") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to Section
5.3, the Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement.

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the Company
will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the
SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. On
the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if
applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the
Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.

 



-64-  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent
Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Parent Filing is filed
with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

(c) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document
with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the Company Stockholder Meeting
pursuant to applicable Law (an "Other Required Parent Filing"), then Parent
and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly
prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC. Parent and
Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates to cause,
any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of
the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates
may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the
SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of
mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Company Filing may contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Company Filing.
The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy Statement
or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

 

(d) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all information concerning it
and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent
Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such
filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the
SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 



-65- (e) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first
providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such written communication, and each Party shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other
Parties or their respective counsel.

(f) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case
may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith.

(g) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable law, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from
the SEC that it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the
Proxy Statement.

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record
date for (and the Company shall not change such record date without the prior
written consent of Parent), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and hold the Company
Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the 20th Business Day following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders. Subject to
Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain
the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are
holders of an insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum
at the Company Stockholder Meeting (provided that, without Parents prior
written consent,

 



-66-  the Company may not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more
than two times pursuant to this clause (i)); (ii) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable law, order
or a request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties not to postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting, including in order to give the Company
Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that
the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made
publicly available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with
a Company Board Recommendation Change); _provided_ that the Company
Stockholder Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned pursuant to this clause
(iii) on more than two separate occasions or for more than five Business Days
for each such postponement or adjournment. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall submit the
adoption of this Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder
Meeting even if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change.

6.5  _Financing_.

(a) _No Amendments to Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy pursuant to, or any replacement of, the Commitment Letters
or the Fee Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement
would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing below the Required Financing Amount (calculated net of the cash
and cash equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries); (ii) impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise expand,
adversely amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) materially
delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing,
less likely to occur when required pursuant to the terms hereof; or (iii)
materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the Guarantor under the
Equity Commitment Letter or the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to enforce
their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that
_inter alia_ Parent and Merger Sub may: (x) modify pricing and implement or
exercise any of the "market flex" provisions exercised by the Lenders in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter and (y) add additional lenders and
Financing Sources (including in replacement of a Lender) to the Debt
Commitment Letter (or all or a portion of the commitments may be assigned to
new or existing lenders and Financing Sources) and reallocate commitments or
assign or re-assign titles and roles to or among parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter. Within two Business Days of receipt, Parent and Merger Sub
will provide the Company with copies of any amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Commitment Letters or Fee Letter made in accordance with
this Section 6.5(a). In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (other than a breach by the Company of this Agreement which
prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the Financing) Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to (A) arrange alternative debt financing
(the "Alternative Debt Financing") from the same or alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to pay the Required Financing Amount on terms and conditions
taken as a whole (including any "market flex" provisions in the Fee Letter),
that are not less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub or that are otherwise

 



-67-  acceptable to Parent; and (B) to obtain one or more new financing commitment
letters with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing and Parent shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of such new financing commitment
letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (and any fee letter in
connection therewith; provided, such fee letter may be redacted to omit the
fee amounts, original issue discount, pricing caps and other economic terms
and the "market flex" provisions thereof, none of which would adversely affect
the amount, conditionality or availability of the Debt Financing contemplated
thereby (other than through the operation of the original issue discount));
provided that in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be
deemed or construed to require Parent to (A) pay any fees, taken as a whole,
in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter
as in effect on the date hereof, or (B) agree to conditionality or economic
terms of the Alternative Debt Financing that taken as a whole are less
favorable than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter (including any flex provisions therein). Any reference in this
Agreement to (1) the "Financing" will include the financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters as amended, modified, waived or replaced, and any
Alternative Debt Financing obtained, in compliance with this Section 6.5; and
(2) the "Commitment Letters" and the Fee Letter will include such documents as
amended, modified, waived or replaced, or any Alternative Debt Financing
obtained, in compliance with this Section 6.5. Upon the reasonable request of
the Company, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing,
including promptly notifying the Company of the receipt by Parent or Merger
Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any Financing
Source with respect to any (i) breach or default which would permit any party
to a Commitment Letter to terminate its obligations thereunder or (ii) any
termination or repudiation by any party to a Commitment Letter, which
termination or repudiation would result in Parent and Merger Sub not having
the Required Financing Amount on the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof until the initial funding of the Financing; (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions as
specified in the Debt Commitment Letters and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to funding the Financing that are applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and the Fee Letter; (iii) if all of the
conditions to the Financing and in Article VII of this Agreement have been
satisfied or waived, consummate the Financing to the extent necessary to
consummate the Merger at Closing; and (iv) comply with its obligations
pursuant to the Commitment Letters.

(c) _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 6.5 will require, and in no
event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or
construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to other than with respect
to any Alternative Debt Financing, seek the Financing from any source other
than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by,
the Commitment Letters.

 



-68- (d) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII, to consummate the Merger at the time contemplated by
Section 2.3.

6.6 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will, and cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts and the Company

applicable, consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials

_however_ , that if the Company in good faith reasonably believes that it has
delivered the Required Financing Information, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed any such
delivery), in which case the Company shall be deemed to have delivered the
Required Financing Information as of the date of delivery of such notice,
unless Parent in good faith reasonably believe that the Company has not
completed delivery of the Required Financing Information and, within three
Business Days after the delivery of such notice to the Parent, the Parent
delivers a written notice to the Company to that effect (stating with
specificity which Required Financing Information the Company has not
delivered); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that such Required
Financing Information will be deemed to not have been delivered if, at any
point prior to the completion of the Debt Financing, (a) such Required
Financing Information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make such Required
Financing Information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; or (b) the Companys auditors have withdrawn any audit
opinion with respect to any financial statements contained in the Required
Financing Information;

(v) cooperating with Parent to obtain customary and reasonable corporate

field examinations and appraisals; (B) complete a customary "borrowing base"
certificate in connection with any asset-based portion of the Debt Financing;

Closing of all indebtedness, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent;

 

(viii) providing authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing
the distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors and
containing a representation to the Financing Sources (A) that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information about the Company or its Subsidiaries or securities and (B) as to
the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing;

(ix) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the

Debt Financing (including distributing the proceeds of the Debt Financing, if

and (B) cause the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the proceeds of the
Debt Financing by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries

(xii) providing Parent and the Financing Sources with such other documents,
certificates, information or other assistance contemplated by the Debt

this clause (xii) require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives to take any action or provide any document,
certificate or other information that violates the terms of this Agreement or
that is inconsistent with the foregoing clauses (i) through (xi).

(b) _Obligations of the Company_. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is
promptly reimbursed pursuant to Section 6.6(e) or is not otherwise
indemnified by or on behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any definitive
agreement that is effective prior to the Effect Time; (iii) give any

determination of the Company, would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, (A) no action,
liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing)) will be effective until the
Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to take any action pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument (other than customary representation
letters and authorization letters (including with respect to the presence or
absence of material non-public information and the accuracy of the information
contained in the disclosure and marketing materials related to the Debt
Financing)) that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that

memoranda required in relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure
reflecting the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor.
Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require (i) any officer or Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate ((1) unless
such 

 



-71-  officer or Representative is indemnified pursuant to this Agreement and (2)
such officer or Representative is only required to sign in his or her capacity
as an officer or Representative and not in any individual capacity) or
opinion or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to result
in personal liability to such officer or Representative or (ii) the Company
Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto.

 

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos and other trademarks in connection with the Debt
Financing so long as such logos (i) are used solely in a manner that does not
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) are used solely
in connection with a description of the Company, its business and products or
the Merger or such other customary manner that does not violate the terms of
the foregoing clause (i).

 

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the
Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents
in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; and (ii) are subject to other
customary confidentiality agreements, including "click through"
confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions contained in
customary bank books and offering memoranda or other undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

 

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6; _provided, however_ , that
Parent shall not be responsible for reimbursing any such costs and expenses if
such costs and expenses would have been incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in the performance of their respective obligations pursuant to
other provisions of this Agreement or other than expenses related to the
Companys preparation of its regular annual and quarterly financial
statements.

 

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives will be indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses
(including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with
their cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement
or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith, except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives.

 



-72- (g) _No Exclusive Arrangements._ Until the Companys receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, unless approved by the Company Board in
advance, in no event will the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates enter into any Contract (i) awarding any agent, broker,
investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory role on an
exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) expressly prohibiting
or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider
of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or
financial advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with a
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection
with the Merger.

 

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

 

6.8 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives and the Financing
Sources and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and
records and personnel of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent
that (a) any applicable Law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege
applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would
violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; or (e)
such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal
Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent
and its Affiliates, on the other hand; provided that the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate on utilizing an alternative method of
production of all such information in the event any of the foregoing
circumstances apply. Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed as an
independent basis to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right
to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. All requests for access pursuant
to this Section 6.8 must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or
another Person designated in writing by the Company.

 



-73- 6.9 _Section_ _ _ _16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the Merger by each individual who is a director or executive
officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors or officers (and any Person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time) (collectively,
the "Indemnified Persons") for any acts or omissions by such Indemnified
Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter,
the Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries
of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement that have been
made available to Parent. During such six-year period, such provisions may not
be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required
by applicable law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of
the provisions of Section 6.10(a), during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or
indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates to the extent that such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective
Time; and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to
have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
insolvent), except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of
any such Legal Proceeding, (1) the Surviving Corporation will have the right
to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation
will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons

 



-74-  entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (2) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such
Legal Proceeding; (3) the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and
expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an
Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not
the Surviving Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding; and (4) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of
such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written
consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which
the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or otherwise seek the
termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought
by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of
any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will
be made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation
(which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person),
the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage, conditions,
retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess
of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company may (and at Parents request shall)
purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the
annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium.
If the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy
is in full force and effect.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of

(i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee
Plans (other than change in control, retention, long term incentive,
nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based compensation or benefits
and individual employment or other compensation

 



-76-  agreements (except with respect to the severance terms contained therein))
(the "Company Plans") at benefit levels that, taken as a whole, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company
or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide
compensation and benefits (other than change in control, retention, long term
incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based compensation
or benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except
with respect to severance terms contained therein)) to each Continuing
Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation, benefits
and severance payments (other than change in control, retention, long term
incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits and
individual employment or other compensation agreements except with respect to
severance terms contained therein)) to each Continuing Employee that, taken
as a whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than change in control, retention, long
term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based benefits
and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except with
respect to the severance terms contained therein)) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Plans
("Comparable Plans"); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and
Comparable Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than change in control, retention,
long term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based
benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except

whole, are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation,
benefits and severance payments (other than change in control, retention, long
term incentive, nonqualified deferred compensation and equity-based
benefits and individual employment or other compensation agreements (except
with respect to the severance terms contained therein)) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company
Plans. In each case, base compensation and target incentive compensation
opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year following the
Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period. For a

available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for
all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and for purposes of
vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement to the same extent such
service was recognized under such Company Plan (or, in the case of a
Comparable Plan, under the similar Company Plan), except that such service
need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of
coverage or compensation or benefits or for any purpose under any equity-based
plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans and
other than any equity-based plan) (such plans, the "New Plans") to the extent
that coverage pursuant to any such New Plan replaces in the plan year in which
the Closing occurs

 



-77-  coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the
"Old Plans") and to the extent that the applicable waiting period under the
Old Plan had been satisfied or waived at or before the Effective Time; (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee in the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, the Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent
such waiting periods, exclusions, and requirements were waived under the
corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan in which the Effective Time occurs and ending on
the date that such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the plan year in which the Closing occurs as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees
pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee in the corresponding Old
Plan to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Any vacation or paid time off
accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be credited to such Continuing Employee following the
Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture
(except to the extent that such limits or forfeitures applied under the
Company Plans in effect as of the date of this Agreement).

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. This Section 6.11 will not be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment or service for any period of time for, or preclude
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment or service of any Continuing
Employee or any other Person at any time and for any or no reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement or

forth in Section 7.3; (iv) the Company has given Parent written notice at

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt
written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail
the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such
termination pursuant to such provision.

 



-85- (b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any
Party (or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such Party) to the other
Parties, as applicable; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no
such termination shall relieve any Party of its obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee, Expense Reimbursement or the Parent Termination Fee, if, as
and when required pursuant to Section 8.3; (ii) subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 8.3, no such termination shall relieve any Party for
liability for such Partys willful and intentional breaches of this Agreement
prior to its termination or for fraud; and (iii) Section 6.6(e), Section
6.6(f), Section 6.14, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX will each
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective
terms. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will
affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement or the Limited Guaranty, which rights, obligations and agreements
will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their respective terms. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, in
no event shall specific performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the Merger or
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement survive termination of this
Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the
Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is

conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) have been satisfied
or are capable of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date and the conditions
set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) would be satisfied if the date
of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition
Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has been publicly announced or shall
have been made known to the Company Board and not withdrawn or otherwise

 



-86-  abandoned; and (D) within one year following the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), as
applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company
enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will concurrently with or promptly
(and in any event within two Business Days) after the earlier of the
consummation of such Acquisition Transaction and execution of such definitive
agreement pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal to $17,400,000
(the "Company Termination Fee"), less the amount of any Expense Reimbursement
previously paid pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to "15%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to
"50%."

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then
the Company must promptly (and in any event within two Business Days)
following such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company

then the Company must prior to or concurrently with such termination pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent; _provided, that_ if such Company Termination Fee is payable in
connection with a termination of this Agreement on or prior to the Cut-off
Date by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h) with respect to the Company
entering into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with a Person or group that
is an Excluded Party at the time of such termination, then the Company
Termination Fee shall be $7,400,000.

 

(iv) If this Agreement is validly terminated by (A) either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if the Requisite Stockholder Approval has

either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d), then the Company
shall reimburse Parent for its out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees
and expenses of the Financing Sources, counsel, accountants, investment
banks, advisors and consultants of Parent and Merger Sub) up to an aggregate
of $5,000,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement"), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the second Business Day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement.

(v) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(e), then the Company shall, upon the election of Parent, pay the Expense
Reimbursement to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the

under this Agreement) (the "Parent Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Company.

 



-87- (d) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
will either the Company or the Parent be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of
this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.

(e)  _Payments_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) Under no circumstances will the collective amounts payable by Parent,
Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement, the
Limited Guaranty or the Commitment Letters exceed an amount equal to
$32,200,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches (the "Parent Maximum
Liability Amount"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing when
required by Section 2.3 for any reason or no reason or otherwise breaches this
Agreement or fails to perform under this Agreement, then (x) a decree or order
of specific performance or an injunction or injunctions or other equitable
relief if and solely to the extent permitted by Section 9.8(b) or (y) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or Section 8.1(i) and
the receipt of payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed
pursuant to Section 8.3(c) (including, without duplication, the Companys
right to enforce the Limited Guaranty with respect thereto and receive the
Parent Termination Fee from Guarantor), will be the sole and exclusive
remedies (whether in contract, tort, equity, law or granted by statute or
otherwise) of Company Related Parties for any breach, cost, loss, expense or
damages suffered as a result thereof or otherwise relating to or arising out
of any Transactional Matters, and in no event will any of the Company Related
Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or
any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person
be entitled to seek or obtain in connection therewith (1) any other remedies
or (2) in the case of monetary recovery or monetary award, any amounts or
award of any kind (including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages) in excess of the Parent Maximum Liability Amount in the aggregate
against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor and the Parent Related Parties. Upon
payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the extent owed to the Company
hereunder, none of the Parent Related Parties will have any further liability
or obligation to the Company, the other Company Related Parties, their
respective Affiliates or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any other documents (including the Commitment Letters and the
Limited Guaranty), or any other Transactional Matters, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Other than the Guarantors
obligations under the Limited Guaranty and other than the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in
no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the
Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to
the Company, the other Company Related Parties, their respective Affiliates
or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other Transactional Matters.

 



-88- (ii) If Parent elects to receive and actually receives the Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(v), such Expense Reimbursement,
together with any Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b),
will be the only monetary recovery Parent and Merger Sub and each of their
respective Affiliates may recover from the Company Related Parties in such
circumstances in respect of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable law arising out of such termination, and
upon payment of such Expense Reimbursement and any Company Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.3(b) in such circumstances, (1) none of the
Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination; and
(2) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person will be entitled to bring
or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any Company
Related Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any
matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties (or
their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries may be entitled to remedies with respect to, the
Confidentiality Agreement).

(g) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. It is agreed that
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in Section 9.8(b), except
that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice
of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in
accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 9.8(b), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive
both specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 9.8(b) and any
monetary damages, including the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement or the Limited Guaranty.

 

(h) _Non-Recourse Parent Party_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against the
named parties, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related
Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their respective
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or
obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award (whether in contract, tort,
equity, law or granted by statute, and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or otherwise) against any Non-Recourse Parent Party relating to or
arising out of any Transactional Matters, other than from Parent or Merger Sub
to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement or the Guarantor to the
extent expressly provided for in the Limited Guaranty and the Equity
Commitment Letter.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable law and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board
, except that in the event that the Company has received the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this Agreement that requires
the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL without such
approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any
amendments, modifications or

 



-89-  alterations of the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in
Section 8.3(f), Section 8.3(h), Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.6, Section
9.10(b), Section 9.11 and this Section 8.4 (and the defined terms used
therein solely as they relate to such sections) to the extent adversely
affecting any of the Financing Sources, shall not be effective with respect to
such affected Financing Sources unless the Lenders provide their prior
written consent to such amendment, modification or alteration.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject
to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay
in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of such right.

8.6 _No Liability of Financing Sources_ _._ None of the Financing Sources
will have any liability to the Company, any Company Stockholders or any of
their respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section
8.6 shall limit the rights of the Company, any Company Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive debt documents executed in connection with
the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under this
Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.

9.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub will have the
right to assign all or any portion of their respective rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a) in

Sub or the Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their respective Affiliates;
or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as
collateral in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that, in

pursuant to the Limited Guaranty; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of
the Merger or otherwise impede the rights of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will
relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Bow Street LLC and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 24, 2016 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), that will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives
will hold and treat all documents and information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their
respective Representatives in connection with the Merger in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
Parent and Merger Sub were parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be
superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in
full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Limited Guaranty and the Commitment Letters, constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



-92- 9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 6.10 and
this Section 9.6, the Parties agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon
any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in
or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b) the rights of the Parent Related Parties
and Non-Recourse Parent Parties under Section 8.3; and (c) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Options to receive the merger
consideration set forth in Article II. The provisions of Section 8.3(f),
Section 8.3(h), Section 8.4, Section 8.6, Section 9.3, Section 9.10(b),
Section 9.11 and this Section 9.6 will inure to the benefit of the Financing
Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be
third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and
their respective successors and assigns).

 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary
damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee).

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject to Section 8.6, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to
and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of
this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and
other

 



-93-  equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the
Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to
enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in
order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with
and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter) if and only if (1) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions
in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing
(provided such conditions would be satisfied as of such date)) at the time
when the Closing would have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3 but for the
failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (2) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements if the Equity Financing is
funded to fund the Merger at the Closing, and (3) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing is funded, then the Closing pursuant to Article II will
occur.

 

(ii) Subject to 9.8(b)(i), the Parties agree not to raise any objections to
(A) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger and the Limited Guaranty, for and on
behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance
with Section 9.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable
law, and nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter,

 



-94-  any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts") in the
event that any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the
Limited Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement, the Limited
Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be brought,
tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the
Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will
not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Limited
Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other
than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that
a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

(b)  _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Merger, the Debt Financing, any applicable debt commitment letter or
credit agreement to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE LIMITED GUARANTY, THE COMMITMENT
LETTERS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES

-95-  (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"),
will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from
earlier versions of this Agreement or any such other document, will be
disregarded in determining the partys intent or the effectiveness of such
signature. No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a
signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.
