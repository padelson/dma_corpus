forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the  Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be

and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except as set forth in _Article II_. Without limiting the
generality  of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Company as the Surviving Corporation
and all claims, obligations,  debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the claims, obligations, debts, liabilities and

take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York,
NY 10022, at 9:00 a.m., New York time, on  the second (2nd) Business Day
following the day on which the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be  satisfied at the
Effective Time, but subject to the fulfillment or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived in accordance with 
this Agreement or at such other date, time or place as the Company and Parent
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 


 

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company and Parent will
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of  State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as  may
be agreed by the Parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 


 

 

Section 1.4. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 


 

  (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the 
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Certificate of Incorporation_ "), shall be immediately amended and restated
in its entirety to be in the form of the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub (except with  respect to the name of the Surviving Corporation,
which from and after the Effective Time shall be the name of the Company),
until thereafter amended or restated as provided therein and by applicable
Law, in each case consistent with the obligations  set forth in _Section
6.9_. 

 

2   (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation  shall
be amended and restated in their entirety to be in the form of the bylaws of
Merger Sub (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
name of the Company), until thereafter amended or restated as provided
therein, by the  certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and by applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth
in _Section 6.9_. 


 

 

Section 1.5. _Directors and Officers_.

 


 

 

(a) The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that the  directors of
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation  or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

  (b) The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,  from and
after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of  incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 


 

 

ARTICLE II

 


 

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 


 

 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any of the following  securities:

 


 

  (a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Common Stock  issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Share_ ")
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time and  Shares owned by the Company, including Shares held in treasury by
the Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") and (ii) the Dissenting Shares (as
defined below)) shall be converted  automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive $11.50 per share in cash, without interest (the
" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares that have been converted into a right to receive  the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each non-
certificated Share represented by book-entry (other than Cancelled Shares
and  Dissenting Shares) (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with this _Article II_. 

 

3   (b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share  shall cease
to be outstanding, be cancelled without any conversion thereof or payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 


 

  (c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value  $0.001 per
share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving  Corporation and together shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 


 

 

Section 2.2. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 


 

  (a) _Treatment          of Options_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (an " _Option_ ")
under any Company Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, become  immediately vested and be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Option to receive (without
interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to the Option 
_multiplied_ by (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share under such Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ with respect to such
payment. For  the avoidance of doubt, any Option which has a per Share
exercise price that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment. 


 

  (b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the  Effective
Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock (" _Restricted Stock_ ")
under any Company Stock Plan shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested and be
cancelled and  shall only entitle the holder of such award to receive
(without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied_   by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld pursuant
to _Section 2.3(e)_ with respect to such payment. 


 

  (c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Immediately prior  to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock units (an " _RSU
Award_ ") under any Company Stock Plan shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested
and be  cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such award to receive
(without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares subject to such award
immediately prior to the  Effective Time _multiplied_ by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld pursuant
to _Section 2.3(e)_ with respect to such payment. 


 

  (d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time,  the Company,
the Board of Directors and the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions
which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.2_. 

 

4  

Section 2.3. _Surrender of Shares_.

 


 

  (a) _Paying Agent_. 


 

  (i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall enter into an
agreement in form and substance reasonably  acceptable to the Company with a
paying agent selected by Parent with the Company's prior written approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, to
act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection  with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive payment of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent 
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, an amount in
cash in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under this _Article II_
(such cash  being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in
trust for the benefit of the holders of the Shares; _provided_ that the
Exchange Fund shall not include any amounts in excess of the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to  Dissenting Shares. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and  interest by, the United
States of America, and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding one month. To the extent that there are losses with respect
to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below 
the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or
restore, or cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund
lost through such  investments and other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and  any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under _Article II_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the
Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)_ shall not  be used for any
purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_.

 


 

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. 


 

  (i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days  thereafter), except as set forth in
_Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of record of Shares (other than
holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A)  transmittal
materials, including a letter of transmittal in customary form as agreed by
the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass only upon delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the
book-entry  transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of
the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and  (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Book-Entry Shares. 

 

5   (ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of  Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver any physical certificate representing any of the Shares or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to  receive as a
result of the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares
and Dissenting Shares) shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agent's  message" in customary form (it being understood that the holders of
Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt
by the Paying Agent of such "agent's message" or such other evidence, if any,
as the Paying Agent may  reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required  Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.3(e))_ equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_
(A) the number of Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by (B) the Per
Share Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued  on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares. 


 

  (iii) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not  registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Book-
Entry Share is registered, a check for any cash to be  exchanged upon due
surrender of the Book-Entry Share may be issued to such transferee or other
Person if such transferee or other Person appears before the Paying Agent and
presents to the Paying Agent all documents required to evidence and effect
such  transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. 


 

  (iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3(b)_ , each
Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled  Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_. The Surviving  Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration. 


 

  (c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the  Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other
than  Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any  required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(e)_ )
upon acceptable evidence of ownership of Book-Entry Shares (which shall
include affidavits of ownership), without any interest thereon in accordance
with the provisions set forth in _Section  2.3(b)_ , and Parent shall remain
liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) payment of any such holder's claim for the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of such holder's Book-Entry  Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to  applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

 

6   (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock  transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   If, after the Effective Time, acceptable evidence of a
Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which  the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. The Per Share Merger Consideration
paid upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message", in the case of
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II,_   shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares formerly represented by such Book-Entry Shares. 


 

  (e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving  Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Options, Restricted Stock or RSU Awards such amounts as it is required
to deduct and  withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. Parent shall (x)
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior notice to the Company of
any such deduction or  withholding (other than (i) payroll withholding
because of the compensatory nature of the applicable payment or (ii) U.S.
backup withholding) and (y) reasonably cooperate with the Company to minimize
or eliminate such deduction or withholding to the  extent permitted by Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts
(i) shall be promptly remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as 
applicable, to the applicable Taxing Authority, and (ii) shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares,
Options, Restricted Stock or RSU Awards (as the case may be) in respect of
which such deduction  and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be. 


 

 

Section 2.4. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), any Shares of Common Stock that are issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and as
to which the holders thereof have continuously held such Shares through the
date shown on the Certificate of Merger giving effect to the Merger, have
not  voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and who have properly demanded appraisal with respect thereto in
accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to any such Shares and  have not effectively withdrawn such demand
(collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_
, unless and until such Person shall have  failed to perfect, effectively
withdrawn, waived or lost such Person's right to appraisal under the DGCL or
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, at  which time
such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ , without interest and 
after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section
2.3(e)_ and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder
thereof shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each
holder of  Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by
the Company for appraisal  and any instruments served pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL that are received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights
of appraisal, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments received
by the Company in respect of Dissenting  Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. Parent shall have the
right to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with  respect to
any such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands;
_provided_ that, after the date hereof until the Effective Time, Parent shall
consult with the Company with respect to such negotiations and proceedings.
The  Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company (not to be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
compromise, or settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or waive any  failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or otherwise to comply with Section 262 of the
DGCL, or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

7  

Section 2.5. _Adjustments_. In the event that the number of Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued
and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the  Effective Time shall
have been changed into a different number of Shares or securities or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), combination, stock dividend or distribution, 
recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as  contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be construed to permit the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited  by _Sections 5.1(b)(i)_ or _5.1(b)(v)_ of this
Agreement.

 


 

 

ARTICLE III

supplements thereto), in each case required to be filed or furnished by it
with the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since
January 1, 2017 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") through the date hereof (all such
forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed or
furnished since the Applicable Date, including all  exhibits and other
information incorporated therein, amendments and supplements thereto,
collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective filing dates, or
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of

Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date of
any such filing. As of the time of filing with the SEC  (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of this Agreement, as
of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
of this Agreement), none of the SEC Reports so filed contained, when filed, 
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the  extent that the information in such SEC Reports
has been amended or superseded by a later SEC Report filed prior to the date
of this Agreement. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the  Exchange Act. To the knowledge
of the Company, the Company has made available to Parent all comment letters
and all material formal correspondence between the SEC and the Company with
respect to the SEC Reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC on  or after
January 1, 2018. Except as set forth in Section 3.7(a) of the Company

statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), change in equity and
cash flows for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Company (including any related notes thereto) for all
interim periods included in  the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q

complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) have  been prepared in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects applied on a consistent basis

consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes

the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments). 


 

  (c) The Company maintains in all material respects disclosure  controls
and procedures required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported
on a timely  basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Company's filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. Based on
the Company's most recently completed evaluation of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting  prior to the date hereof, the Company has
not identified any fraud that involves the Company's management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date, except as  set forth in the
SEC Reports, the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the  Board of Directors any instances identified by them or of
which they have been made aware of "significant deficiencies," "material
weaknesses" or fraud. 

 

14   (d) As of the date hereof, except (i) as reflected, accrued or  reserved
against in the financial statements (including all notes and schedules

for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
since June 30,  2020; (iii) for liabilities or obligations which have been
discharged or paid in full prior to the date of this Agreement; and (iv) for

the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, neither the Company nor any

GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or the notes thereto), other than those  which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 3.7(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
correct and complete list of all indebtedness for borrowed money of the 
Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 15, 2020, other than (v) loans

true, correct and complete copies of (a) the executed debt commitment letter,
dated as of October 1, 2020 among Parent, Merger  Sub and the Debt Financing
Sources party thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto,
as amended from time to time after the date hereof to the extent not
prohibited by this Agreement, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant  to
which the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject only to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to lend the aggregate amounts set forth therein
(such lending and funding, the " _Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes set
forth  therein, (b) the fee letter entered into by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Fee
Letter_ "); _provided_ that specific fee amounts and specific "market flex"
terms, if any, none  of which imposes, nor do they permit the imposition of,
any new conditions (or the modification or expansion of any existing
conditions) may have been redacted, and (c) the executed equity commitment
letter, dated as of October 1, 2020, among Parent,  the Guarantors and the
other parties thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto,
as amended from time to time after the date hereof to the extent not
prohibited by this Agreement, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, 
together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "),
pursuant to which the Guarantors have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to make a cash equity contribution in the
aggregate amount set forth  therein (such equity contribution, the " _Equity
Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ") for
the purposes set forth therein. The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the
Company is a third-party beneficiary  thereto in accordance with the terms
thereof. As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment Letters has been
amended, supplemented or modified, no such amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated or pending (other than amendments,  supplements
or modifications to the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and similar entities), and the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
terminated or  rescinded in any respect and, to the knowledge of Parent and
Merger Sub, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated.
Except for the Fee Letter and the Commitment Letters, there are no side
letters or Contracts to which Parent,  Merger Sub or any Affiliate of either
thereof is a party related to the terms, provision, lending, funding or
investing, as applicable, of the Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby. As of the date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub have fully  paid (or
caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees that are required
to be paid pursuant to the Commitment Letters on or prior to the date hereof.
The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal,
valid,  binding and enforceable obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, to fund the full
amount of the Financing subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
Financing Conditions, in each  case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions. There are no conditions precedent to funding the full amount of
the Financing (including pursuant to any market flex provisions with respect
to the Fee Letter delivered in connection with the  Debt Financing), other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to the Company
prior to the date hereof or as amended from time to time to the extent not
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement (such conditions, the "
_Financing          Conditions_ "). As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or
would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their  respective Affiliates or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any of the Commitment
Letters, in each case that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or
impede the Closing or (ii) result in any portion of the amounts to  be
provided, loaned, funded or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters
being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof and assuming
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , Parent
has no  reason to believe that any of the conditions precedent to the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters within the control of Parent
and Merger Sub will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing
will not be made available to  Parent and Merger Sub in full on the Closing
Date. Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that would or
would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions precedent to the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters within  the control of
Parent and Merger Sub not to be satisfied or the full amount of the Financing
not to be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof,
and assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article           VII_ and the funding of the Financing in
accordance with the Commitment Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the
Closing Date funds sufficient to pay all amounts payable by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to _Article II_ on the  Closing Date and to pay any and all fees
and expenses required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing
(collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ "). Notwithstanding  anything herein to
the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that
neither the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub nor the availability to Parent or
Merger Sub of the Financing or any other financing shall be a condition to
the  obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

available by the Company to Parent); or 

 

45   (iv) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and
participating and engaging in any negotiations or  discussions with any
Person or group (and their respective Representatives) who has made a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in material breach of
_Section 6.1(b)_ (which negotiations or discussions need not be solely  for
clarification purposes, and may include the solicitation of a revised
Acquisition Proposal) if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel  and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute, result in
or lead to a Superior Proposal; 


 

  (v) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a Change of
Recommendation (to the extent permitted by _Section  6.1(e)_ ); or 


 

  (vi) resolving or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions, to the
extent such actions would be permitted by the  foregoing _clauses (i)_
through _(v)_. 


 

  (d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.1(c)_ or as  contemplated
by _Section 6.1(e)_ , the Board of Directors and any committee thereof shall
not (i) (A) withdraw or rescind (or change or qualify, in a manner materially
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw or rescind 
(or change or qualify, in a manner materially adverse to Parent or Merger Sub)
the Recommendation in a manner materially adverse to Parent, (B) fail to
include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) approve, adopt or
recommend or publicly  propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (D) fail to announce publicly, within ten (10)
Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to any
securities of the Company has been commenced, that the Board of  Directors
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) recommends rejection of such tender
or exchange offer (each such action set forth in clauses (A) through (D) above
being a " _Change of Recommendation "_) or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the  Company to enter into a merger agreement, binding letter of intent,
share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement
or other similar binding agreement (other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to any  Acquisition Proposal or recommend any tender
offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal. 

 

46   (e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.1_ to the  contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (i) the Board of
Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event or (ii) if the Board of
Directors (or a  duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in
response to an Acquisition Proposal (whether before or after the No-Shop
Period Start Date) that did not result  from a material breach of _Section
6.1(b)_ , that such proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and such
Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn as of such time, the Board of Directors
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) may (1) effect a Change  of
Recommendation on account of such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal or
fail to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and/or (2) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive
agreement  with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that, (A) prior
to or simultaneously with any such termination by the Company, the Company
pays to Parent any Company Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_ ,  subject to and in accordance with the terms of
_Section 8.2(b)(i)_ , and (B) after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) determines that the failure to  make a Change of
Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company will  not be
entitled to effect such Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ unless (x) the Company delivers to
Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ "), at least four (4) Business
Days  before the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
takes such action, advising Parent that the Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) proposes to take such action and containing the
material details of such  Intervening Event or the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Proposal (and shall have provided to Parent a copy
of the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered into in respect
of such Superior Proposal), as applicable, that is  the basis of the proposed
action of the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) and
(y) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th)  Business
Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00
p.m. New York City time on the fourth (4th) Business Day immediately following
the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the " _Notice
Period_ "), the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof)
shall have determined in good  faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors and taking into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement agreed to in writing by Parent during the Notice
Period) that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation or  to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or in the case
of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues to 
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms or conditions (including the
provision of financing) of such Acquisition Proposal (which, after taking into
account any  changes offered and agreed to in writing by Parent during the
Notice Period, ceased to constitute a Superior Proposal) that would reasonably
be likely to result in such Acquisition Proposal again constituting a Superior
Proposal, shall require a new  Company Notice and an additional two (2)
Business Day Notice Period. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries and direct its or their Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with  Parent and its
Representatives to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that, (A) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (B) in
the case of  an Intervening Event, the failure of the Board of Directors (or
a duly authorized committee thereof) to make a Change of Recommendation would
not be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. 


 

  (f) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that any Acquisition Proposal may be evaluated by an
independent committee of disinterested members of the Board of Directors and
each provision of this _Section          6.1_ that is applicable to
the Board of Directors and its financial advisors and outside legal counsel
with respect to the evaluation of an Acquisition Proposal shall apply to such
committee's (and it's financial advisors' and legal counsel's)  evaluation of
such Acquisition Proposal, as applicable. 

 

47   (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have  the
meanings assigned below: 


 

  (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any Person
or group of Persons (other than  Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates) relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition, purchase,
sale, lease or other disposition of assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
in one transaction or a series of related transactions, that  constitutes 15%
or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) any issuance of Shares representing
15% or more of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company,
(C)  any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of the total voting power of the
equity securities of the Company, (D) any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business  combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar business combination transaction involving
the equity of the Company, or (E) any combination of the foregoing. 


 

  (ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person or group of Persons from whom
the Company, the Board of Directors (or  a duly authorized committee thereof)
or any of their respective Representatives has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date that the Board of Directors (or a  duly authorized
committee thereof) determines in good faith (such determination to be made
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date and after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a  Superior Proposal; provided that any Person shall immediately and
irrevocably cease to be an Excluded Party (and the provisions of this
Agreement applicable to Excluded Parties shall cease to apply with respect to
such Person) if the Acquisition  Proposal submitted by such Person is
withdrawn or terminated (it being understood that a modification of an
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or group of Persons shall not,
in and of itself, be deemed to be a withdrawal or termination of an 
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person or group of Persons). 


 

  (iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, occurrence,
development or change in circumstances with  respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which (A) (i) was unknown to, and was not
reasonably foreseeable by, the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) as of the date hereof, or (ii) if known to, or  reasonably
foreseeable by, the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) as of the date hereof, the material consequences of which were not
known and reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee  thereof) as of the date hereof and (B) becomes known to
or by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) prior to
the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that
none of the following will  alone constitute an Intervening Event: changes in
the market price or trading volume of the Shares or the fact that the Company
meets or exceeds internal or published projections, budgets, forecasts or
estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial  results for any period
(provided, however, that the underlying causes of such changes or fact shall
not be excluded by the foregoing). 

 

48   (iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (except that the references therein to  "15%" shall be replaced by
"50%"), in each case, that the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) in good faith determines, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, after taking into account all
such  factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the Board of
Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), including legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory (including
antitrust), timing or other  aspects of such proposal or offer (including any
break-up fee, expense reimbursement provisions, and conditions to
consummation) and the transactions contemplated hereby and after taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed  in writing by
Parent in response to such Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance
with, _Section 6.1(e)_ , to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated
hereby. 


 

 

Section 6.2. _Proxy Statement_. Unless the Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) has made a Change of Recommendation, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,  assuming timely performance
by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations under this _Section 6.2_ , the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and each of
the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective  Affiliates to,
prepare and file with the SEC all other documents required by the Exchange Act
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and Parent and the Company will cooperate with each other with the
preparation  of the Proxy Statement and any such other filings; _provided_
that in no event shall the Company be required to file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub will, as promptly as  possible, furnish to the Company the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Unless the
Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee  thereof) has made a
Change of Recommendation, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after
receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to  correct
any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC and dissemination to the stockholders of the
Company of any  necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Proxy Statement and any  request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall promptly provide to
the Parent copies of all written correspondence with the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the transactions contemplated  hereby. Subject to
applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company shall (unless and until a Change of
Recommendation  has occurred or in connection with the matters described in
_Section 6.1_ ) provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose reasonable comments on such document or response and shall consider in
good faith comments  reasonably proposed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement without the
review or comment of Parent in the event of a Change of Recommendation. The
Company shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable, _provided_ ,
that the Company shall not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to
the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the  later of (i) the date the
SEC staff confirms that it has no further comments thereon or that it will not
review the Proxy Statement and (ii) the No-Shop Period Start Date. All
documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in 
connection with the Merger will comply as to form and substance in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

 

49  

Section 6.3. _Stockholders Meeting_. Unless the Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) has made a Change of Recommendation, the
Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a  duly authorized
committee thereof), shall promptly (but no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the later of (a) confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement or that it will not review the Proxy Statement
and  (b) the No-Shop Period Start Date, subject to the last sentence of this
_Section 6.3_ ) take all reasonable action required under the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the applicable requirements of
the NYSE necessary to  duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof permitted by this Agreement, the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided_   that the Company may postpone, recess
or adjourn such meeting for up to thirty (30) days (i) to the extent required
by Law, (ii) if the Company has notified Parent pursuant to _Section 6.1(e)_
that the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized  committee thereof) intends
to effect a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , (iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies to the extent the Company reasonably  believes necessary
in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, (iv) if as of the time for
which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person
or  by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Stockholders Meeting or (v) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Board of  Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
is necessary under applicable Law or fiduciary duty for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by  the Company's
stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through
its Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), shall except
as permitted by _Section 6.1(e)_ , (a) include in the Proxy Statement the 
Recommendation and, subject to the consent of the Financial Advisor, the
written opinion of the Financial Advisor, dated as of the date hereof, as to
the fairness of the Per Share Merger Consideration from a financial point of
view and (b) use its  reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite
Vote; _provided_ that the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) may make a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section
6.1(e)_ and, following such  Change of Recommendation, may fail to (i)
include in the Proxy Statement the Recommendation or (ii) use such reasonable
best efforts. The Company shall, upon reasonable request by Parent, keep
Parent informed with respect to proxy solicitation  results.

 


 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be required to hold the Stockholders Meeting if this
Agreement is terminated.

Section 6.4. _Regulatory Approvals_.

 


 

  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, each Party will (and, in the case of Parent, cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Group_ ") to) use its
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all  things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
Party hereto agrees to (i) as  promptly as practicable and in any event
within seven (7) Business Days after the date hereof, file or cause to be
filed any and all required notifications, applications and other filings with
respect to each of the Healthcare Regulatory Approvals, and  to supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested in connection with obtaining the Healthcare
Regulatory Approvals and to cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection in  connection with obtaining the Healthcare Regulatory Approvals
and (ii) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (each, an
" _HSR Filing_ ") as promptly  as practicable and in any event within five
(5) Business Days after the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take any  and all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination
of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.
Parent shall provide to the Company copies of all documents that must be
submitted  to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with Parent's HSR Filing, promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business
Day) after such documents are identified; _provided_ that, to the extent
appropriate, such documents  may be shared with the Company on an outside
counsel basis only. 


 

  (b) Each of Parent Group and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the 
Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced
in _Section 6.4(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations or
expiration of waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the  HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its best efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any Proceeding initiated by a  private party; (ii) subject to
applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as promptly as reasonably
practicable all information required for any application or other filing to be
made by the other Party pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) promptly notify the
other Party of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division
of the  Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection
with any Proceeding by a private Party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated  hereby or the Subsequent Transaction and, subject
to applicable Law, furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all
correspondence, filings (including Item 4(c) and Item 4(d) documents in
connection with the HSR Act filing) and communications  between them and the
FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or, until the Closing Date, the
Subsequent Transaction; (iv) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any  inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested
by the DOJ, FTC, or by any other Governmental Entity in respect of such
registrations, declarations and filings  or such transactions; and (v) permit
the other Party to review in advance any substantive communication given by it
to, and consult with each other in advance, and consider in good faith the
other Party's reasonable comments in connection with, any  submission,
communication, meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party,
with any other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any of
the  documents or information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ are
commercially or competitively sensitive, the Company, or Parent, as the case
may be, may satisfy its obligations by providing such documents or information
to the other Party's  outside counsel, with the understanding and agreement
that such counsel shall not share such documents and information with its
client in connection with or relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, until the Closing Date, the  Subsequent Transaction;
_provided_ , _further_ , that materials may also be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address  reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to the extent
that that such attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns
are not governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine. For purposes of
this  Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890,
the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act of 1914 and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders,  decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or  acquisition. 

 

51   (c) No Party shall independently participate in any substantive  meeting
or communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Subsequent Transaction
without giving the  other Parties sufficient prior notice of the meeting or
communication and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the
opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting or communication,
provided that, such notice and opportunity  obligations specifically relating
to any filings, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
Subsequent Transaction shall continue only until the Closing Date. 


 

  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this 
Agreement, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, take any and all
steps that are (i) necessary or (ii) identified or requested (whether formally
or informally) by  the FTC, the DOJ, or any Governmental Entity to (x)
resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Subsequent Transaction under any Antitrust  Law or in connection with any
Healthcare Regulatory Approval or (y) avoid the entry of, effect the
dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree,
order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so as to
enable the Parties to close the contemplated transactions expeditiously (but
in no event later than the End Date). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent  shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to,
(i) propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition, or license of any
assets, properties, facilities, clinics,  products, rights, services or
businesses of Parent, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates, or the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest therein, or agree to any other
structural or conduct remedy, (ii) otherwise take or commit to take any 
actions that would limit Parent's, Parent's Subsidiaries, Parent's Affiliates,
or the Company's or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to retain or sell any assets, properties, facilities,
clinics, products,  rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parent's
Affiliates, or the Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest or interests
therein, (iii) otherwise commit to take any actions that would limit Parent's,
Parent's Subsidiaries, or Parent's Affiliates  (or, with respect to any
period after the Closing Date, the Company's or its Subsidiaries') freedom of
action with respect to, or its or their ability to acquire, any assets,
properties, facilities, clinics, products, rights, services or businesses of 
any other entity or third party (other than the Company), including the
Subsequent Transaction Buyer; and (iv) modify, restructure, amend, terminate,
or revise, any agreement or arrangement entered into or proposed to be entered
into by Parent or  Parent's Affiliates or to which Parent or Parent's
Affiliates are a party, including with respect to the Subsequent Transaction
or any Financing, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Parties  shall not be obligated to take any
action with respect to the Company the effectiveness of which is not
conditioned on the Closing occurring. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's
obligations under this _Section 6.4(d)_ are an absolute commitment  not
subject to the best efforts applicable to the remainder of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_. 

 

52   (e) If on the date that is ninety (90) days after the date of this 
Agreement, the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ has not been satisfied,
Parent will terminate, or cause to be terminated, any agreement relating to
the Subsequent Transaction (including the Subsequent Transaction Agreement)
and any other  Prohibited Agreement (whether or not set forth on _Section
4.6_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule). 


 

  (f) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,  without the
prior written consent of the Company, which may be given or withheld in its
sole discretion, acquire or agree to acquire, transfer or sell, by merging
with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing or selling a portion of
the assets  of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire, sell or transfer
any assets (including dialysis clinics),  or take any other action (including
with respect to the Subsequent Transaction), if the entering into or amendment
or modification of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of
such transaction, or the taking of any other action, would  reasonably be
expected to (or in the case of the Subsequent Transaction, could reasonably be
expected to) (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially
increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders or 
declarations of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an order  prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause
their Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) take or agree to take any action
with respect to the Subsequent Transaction or any other arrangement with 
respect to Fresenius Medical Care Ventures, LLC (the " _Subsequent Transaction
Buyer_ ") or any of its Affiliates (individually or in conjunction with the
Subsequent Transaction Buyer or any of its Affiliates) that would be
reasonably likely to  prevent or materially delay the Closing. 

 

53   (g) In no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be 
obligated to bear any cost or expense or pay any fee, except of its own legal
and consulting fees, in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations
or approvals required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. For  avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be responsible for the payment
of (i) all filing fees under any Antitrust Laws and (ii) all filing and
license fees in connection with the Healthcare Regulatory Approvals. 


 

  (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including this
_Section          6.4_ ) to the contrary, Parent and the Company will
undertake all communications with the FTC, the DOJ, or any Governmental Entity
related to any filings under the HSR Act on the basis of the principles set
forth on _Section 6.4_ of the  Company Disclosure Schedule. 


 

 

Section 6.5. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 


 

  (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time  and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , upon reasonable
prior written notice from Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) afford Parent, the Debt Financing Sources and their
respective  Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable
Law, during business hours to the operations of the Company, its principal
personnel and Representatives and properties, offices, and other facilities
and to all books and records, and shall  furnish Parent, the Debt Financing
Sources and their respective Representatives with all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent and the Debt Financing Sources and their
respective Representatives, may from time to time reasonably  request in
writing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) afford the Subsequent Transaction Buyer and its respective
Representatives reasonable access to the Clinic Joint Ventures related to the
Subsequent  Transaction and the books, records, principal personnel and
Representatives thereof. Any such access shall be conducted on a basis
consistent with the access provided prior to the execution of this Agreement,
including with regard to the treatment of  items identified as "competitively
sensitive information". Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such access shall
be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or  otherwise
result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
the Company's officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of
their normal duties and, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) shall not include
any  environmental sampling or invasive environmental testing and (ii) shall
not require the Company to make available access to the Clinic Joint Ventures
or the principal personnel and representatives thereof except as consented to
in writing by the  Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice  its rights or the rights of any of its
officers, directors or employees, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or contravene any applicable Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding  agreement provided,
however that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss
of attorney-client privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to 
this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall be directed to the General Counsel of the Company
or such other Person as is designated in writing by the Company. No access,
review or notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall have any effect for the
purpose  of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty given
by any of the Parties to any of the other Parties.

  (a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective  Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed
by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (each a  " _Continuing Employee_ " and collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") (i) unless otherwise agreed to between a Continuing
Employee and the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof, salary, wage rate and  target bonus opportunity for each
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the salary, wage rate and target bonus
opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately  prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) welfare and other retirement benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the welfare and other retirement
benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For  a period of at least one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit
of each Continuing Employee a severance or termination arrangement that is

assumed, the terms of all Company Plans, subject to the amendment and
termination provisions thereof.

Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give each
Continuing  Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has

similar Company Plan, use commercially reasonable efforts to give each
Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment
with the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and  vesting
credit (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan)
under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been
performed with Parent; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not
apply (x) for  purposes of any Parent benefit plan under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service, (y) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits
or (z) for purposes of any plan or  arrangement that is grandfathered or
frozen, either with respect to the level of benefits or participation. 

 

56   (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay  or
cause the applicable subsidiary to pay to each eligible employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the first payroll date following the
Effective Time, or, if later, the date that the Company normally pays annual
bonuses, but in no event later  than March 15, 2021, and subject to such
eligible employee remaining continuously employed through the Effective Time,
any unpaid annual bonus (or other cash incentive award) relating to the entire
2020 fiscal year (or completed performance period  during the 2020 fiscal
year) (the " _2020 Bonuses_ "); _provided_ that, any amounts payable in
respect of the entire 2020 fiscal year or prior period during the 2020 fiscal

such cash incentive compensation as of the close of the calendar month
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that an eligible
employee is terminated  without "cause" prior to the payment of the 2020
Bonuses, such eligible employee's 2020 Bonus shall be paid as soon as
administratively practicable following such termination of employment. 


 

  (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing  Employee
any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which  rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided
otherwise in a written agreement between  Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this  Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be
an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from amending or 
terminating any Company Plans in accordance with their terms or (iii) create
any third-party rights in any current or former service provider of the
Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof). 


 

 

Section 6.9. _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

 


 

  (a) From and after the Effective Time and ending on the sixth 
anniversary of the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "),  against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or awards paid in settlement, incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding  or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " _Proceeding_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time  (including the fact that such Person is or was a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time), whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the  Effective Time, to the fullest extent
that the Company would have been permitted under Delaware Law and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent or the Surviving  Corporation
shall advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred
in the defense of any Proceeding, including any expenses incurred in enforcing
such Person's rights under this _Section 6.9_ , to the extent that such 
indemnification with respect to or advancement of such expenses is authorized
under the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any
Subsidiary; _provided_   that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a final and non-appealable determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to  indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 6.9_ ). In the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification  could be sought
by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise 
consents, and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. In the event any Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnified Party and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party under this _Section          6.9_ , (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof
after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the
defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any 
right to object to the Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
shall elect to control  the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iii) no
Indemnified Party shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. 

 

57   (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section          6.9(a)_ , upon learning of any such Proceeding,
shall promptly notify Parent thereof in writing, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party except to the  extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying Party. 


 

  (c) Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, the provisions  in the
Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and bylaws with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present directors and officers shall be no less favorable to such directors
and officers than  such provisions contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that  would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals. 


 

  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully  pre-
pay the premium for (and following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, with reputable and financially sound carriers) a run-off "tail"
policy of the  directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_") in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
(whichever is greater) of six (6) years from  and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim arising from facts or events that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions,
coverage limits and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as 
the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies in effect on the
date hereof. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation  shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with terms, conditions, retentions, coverage  limits and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase  comparable insurance as the DandO Insurance (from reputable and
financially sound carriers) for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the
coverage provided under the  Company's existing policies as of the date
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in no event shall the Company or
the Surviving Corporation expend for any such policies pursuant to this
_Section 6.9(d)_ an annual premium amount in excess of  300% of the aggregate
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance, and
(y) if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such maximum
amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with
the  greatest coverage available for such maximum amount. 

 

58   (e) Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the  Surviving
Corporation to honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party
prior to the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent. 


 

  (f) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their  respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all  of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or the acquiror of such assets  (including its ultimate parent)
shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_ _._  


 

  (g) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the  Merger and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and Representatives. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding (whether arising before, at
or after  the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party, on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 6.9_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation. 


 

  (h) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section  6.9_ shall
be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or the comparable governing instruments
of any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing
in  this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and  employees, it being understood that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.9_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies. 

 

59  

Section 6.10. _Transaction Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Section 2.4_
with regard to appraisal rights, in the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the  other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought, or to the Company's knowledge, threatened,
against the Company or any members of its Board of Directors (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) on or after the date of this Agreement and 
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of any such Transaction Litigation (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and shall keep Parent
reasonably  informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
(a) give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parent's expense, in the
defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and (b) consult with
Parent with respect to the defense  and settlement of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company shall not settle or agree to settle any Transaction
Litigation without Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).   Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 6.10_ , any litigation or claim relating to
Dissenting Shares shall be governed by _Section 2.4_.

 


 

 

Section 6.11. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement, the  Financing and any
Alternative Financing.

 


 

 

Section 6.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause any dispositions of Company equity securities  (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual (including any Person who is deemed to be a "director by
deputization" under applicable securities Laws) who is subject to the
reporting  requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 


 

 

Section 6.13. _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or other form of anti-
takeover statute or regulation is or may become applicable to  the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions  may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. Nothing in this
_Section 6.13_ shall be  construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub to take any
act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of
the Company's rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 

 

60  

Section 6.14. _Certain Affiliate Agreements_.

 


 

  (a) The Company shall cause each of (i) the Amended and Restated 
Stockholders Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2010, by and among C.P. Atlas
Holdings, Inc., Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P., Centerbridge Capital
Partners SBS, L.P., Centerbridge Capital Partners Strategic, L.P. and the

Section 6.15. _Financing_.

 


 

  (a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and terminating  on
the earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with _Article VIII_ , each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and  to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including
complying with any request requiring the  exercise of so-called "market flex"
provisions in the Fee Letter in connection with the Debt Financing), including
using reasonable best efforts to: 


 

  (i) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters (subject to
Parent's right to replace, restate,  supplement, modify, assign, substitute
or amend the Commitment Letters in accordance herewith); 


 

  (ii) negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms contained in the  Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto), or on such other terms that,
taken as a whole, (i) would not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
available to be funded at the Closing below the amount  required to fund the
Financing Uses (taking into account any increase in any other Financing and
other available sources) and (ii) are no less favorable in the aggregate to
Parent and Merger Sub than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
as  in effect on the date of this Agreement (as determined by Parent in its
reasonable judgment) (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto), in each case, which terms shall not impose, nor permit the
imposition of, any new conditions (or  the modification or expansion of any
existing conditions) or the limitation, amendment or waiver of any applicable
remedies available with respect to the Financing (such definitive agreement,
the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ "); 

 

61   (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions
precedent in the Commitment Letters and such  Definitive Financing Agreements
that are to be satisfied by, and within the control of, Parent and/or Merger
Sub, including (without limitation) the satisfaction of conditions relating to
(A) the preparation and delivery of pro forma financial  statements, (B) the
payment of fees and expenses, (C) the execution and/or delivery of documents
and instruments in connection with the Debt Financing, and (D) the delivery of
any applicable beneficial ownership certification and information under 
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, in each case, relating to Parent, Merger Sub and its Affiliates;
and 


 

  (iv) upon the reasonable request of the Company, confirm with the Debt
Financing Sources their intent and ability to  perform, and the availability
of the Debt Financing, under the Debt Commitment Letter, subject in each case
to satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions (including consummation
of the Equity Financing), and that neither Parent nor the Debt  Financing
Sources are aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be expected
to result in the failure of a Financing Condition; and 


 

  (v) in the event that all conditions in Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment
Letter (other than conditions that by their  nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that would be
expected to be satisfied substantially concurrently with the Closing),
consummate or cause to be consummated the Financing at or prior to the 
Closing. 


 

 

Parent shall, upon the Company's reasonable written request, provide the
Company with copies of any Definitive Financing Agreements and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow  the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause
its other Subsidiaries not to, take any action (including by incurring any
indebtedness other than the Debt Financing or  Alternative Financing in
accordance with _Section 6.10(b)_ ) that would reasonably be expected to cause
the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section
6.10(b)_ ) not to be available to fund the Financing Uses on  the Closing
Date. Upon the reasonable written request of the Company, Parent shall
promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, inform the Company in
reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of its
and Merger  Sub's efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating thereto. During the
period commencing on the date of this Agreement and termination on the earlier
to occur of the Closing and the  termination of this Agreement pursuant to
and in accordance with _Article VIII_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any
of their Affiliates) will take any action in connection with the Debt
Financing that would require the Company to make any  filings with the SEC or
include information in such filings that the Company would not otherwise
reasonably expect to have included in its filings with the SEC at such time.

 

 

62   (b) In the event that all conditions in Exhibit C to the Debt  Commitment
Letter (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied (other than those conditions that would be
expected to be satisfied substantially concurrently with the Closing) and the
Debt  Financing shall not have been funded at or prior to the Closing, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Debt Financing and the
Person committing to provide the Debt Financing to comply with its obligations
under the Debt  Commitment Letter and the Definitive Financing Agreements to
which they are a party and to cause such Person to fund such Debt Financing. 


 

  (c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes 
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
prior to the earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to and in  accordance with _Article VIII_ (other than by
reason of breach of this Agreement by the Company), Parent shall promptly upon
becoming aware thereof notify the Company, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their respective reasonable best  efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an  amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is and remains
available to Parent, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay all Financing Uses at the Closing (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") and  provide the Company with a copy of the new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter_ ") promptly upon the effectiveness thereof, which
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter  shall not be required to include
terms, fees, interest rates and other costs and conditions (including any
"market flex" provisions applicable thereto) that, taken as a whole, are
materially less beneficial to Parent or Merger Sub than those terms,  fees,
interest rates and other costs and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto);
provided, that Parent and Merger Sub shall have no obligation to seek the cash
equity from any  source other than those counter parties to the Equity
Commitment Letter, or in any amount with respect to an investor in excess of
such investor's commitment. As applicable, references in this Agreement (other
than with respect to representations in  this Agreement made by Parent and
Merger Sub that speak as of the date hereof) (i) to Financing or Debt
Financing, as applicable, shall include Alternative Financing, as applicable,
(ii) to Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable,  shall
include the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, as applicable and (iii)
to Definitive Financing Agreements shall include the definitive documentation
relating to any such Alternative Financing. Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company  true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub
with any portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses;
_provided_ , that any specific  fee amounts and any specific "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto set forth therein may be redacted so long as
such redacted terms do not impose, or permit the imposition of, new or
additional conditions precedent or the expansion of any  existing conditions
precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing. 


 

  (d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.15(c)_ ,  Parent shall
promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Company
in writing of the occurrence of any of the following: (i) termination,
withdrawal, repudiation, rescission, cancellation or expiration of any
Commitment Letter  of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) any breach or default
under any Commitment Letter by any party to such Commitment Letter of which
Parent becomes aware, and (iii) receipt by any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives of  any written notice or other written
communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or
threatened (in writing) breach, default, termination, withdrawal, repudiation,
rescission or cancellation by any party to any Commitment  Letter or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among Parent, on the one hand, and
any Debt Financing Source, on the other hand, in each case if as a result
thereof it is reasonably likely that Parent will not be able to obtain all or
any  portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Commitment Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days after any such request, Parent shall provide to the
Company and its  Representatives any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this _Section
6.15(c)_. 

 

63   (e) During the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and 
terminating on the earlier to occur of the Closing and the termination of this

Parent or  Merger Sub to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such Party (or, in the

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 


 

  (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section          8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any
partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
agent or other Representative of such  Party) to the other Parties, as
applicable, except as provided in _Section 6.5(b)_ , _Section 6.7_ , this
_Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , which shall survive such
termination in accordance with their terms; _provided_   that, nothing herein
shall relieve any Party hereto of any liability for damages resulting from
actual and intentional fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination by any Party hereto (which damages the Parties acknowledge and 
agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and in the case of any damages sought by the Company from Parent or
Merger Sub, including for any actual and intentional fraud or Willful Breach,
such damages can be based  on the actual and/or potential damages incurred by
the Company's stockholders in the event such stockholders would not receive
the benefit of the bargain negotiated by the Company on their behalf as set
forth in this Agreement, taking into  consideration relevant matters
including other combination opportunities and the time value of money);
_provided_ , _further_ , that except in the case of actual and intentional
fraud, under no circumstances shall the liability for damages,  including
upon a Willful Breach, exceed the Liability Cap. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their right
to specific performance under _Section 9.12_. The Confidentiality  Agreement
and Parent Guarantee shall not be affected by the termination of this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. 

 

72   (b) In the event that: 


 

  (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section  8.1(e)(ii)_ , then the Company
shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee, on or prior
to the date of termination in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or as promptly as reasonably practicable in  the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(ii)_ (and, in any event, within two
(2) Business Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. 


 

  (ii) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ or by Parent  pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ and (A) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of a vote to
approve this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or
adjournment thereof an Acquisition Proposal shall  have been made directly to
the Company's stockholders or an Acquisition Proposal shall have otherwise
become publicly known or, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)(i)_ , an Acquisition Proposal shall have been provided to the  Company
or the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), and such
Acquisition Proposal shall have not been withdrawn prior to such taking of a
vote to approve this Agreement or, in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section  8.1(e)(i)_ , prior to the breach that forms the basis of such
termination and (B) within nine (9) months after such termination, the Company
shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal or entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to an  Acquisition Proposal (which is subsequently
consummated, whether within such nine (9) month period or thereafter), then,
in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the
Company Termination Fee, such payment to be made within  two (2) Business
Days from the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. For the purpose of this _Section 8.2(b)(ii)_ ,
all references in the definition of the term Acquisition Proposal to "15% or 
more" will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%". 


 

  (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by either  Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ and the applicable Legal Restraint
giving rise to such termination arises in connection with a Proceeding brought
or initiated by, or the inaction of, a Governmental Entity; (B) by either
Parent  or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ and either (i) the
condition to the Parties' obligation to close set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
arises in connection with a Legal Restraint resulting from a Proceeding
brought or initiated by, or  the inaction of, a Governmental Entity or
_Section 7.1(c)_ is not satisfied (or there is an agreement not to consummate
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Entity
with authority over the HSR Approval) or the  condition set forth in _Section
7.2(e)_ shall not have been satisfied or otherwise waived by Parent or (ii)
the Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_ ; or (C) by the Company  pursuant to _Section_
_8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section_ _8.1(g)_ , then Parent shall pay to the Company (or
its designee) a fee of $32,237,669 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, such  payment to be made within two
(2) Business Days of the applicable termination. 

 

73   (d) The Parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no  event
shall either the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee, or
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, on
more than one occasion. 


 

  (e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that  (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company
Termination Fee,  Parent Termination Fee, and/or other amounts payable under
this _Section 8.2_ are payable are uncertain and incapable of calculation and,
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ are not a
penalty, but are liquidated  damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company, Parent, their respective Affiliates and their
respective Representatives for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and other  documents
contemplated hereby and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. If the  Company fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ , or Parent fails to promptly pay an amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.2(c)_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the  other hand, commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ , or
any portion thereof, or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in
_Section 8.2(c)_ , or any portion  thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent,
on the one hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and
expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by the Company)  in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such payment from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal,  Eastern Edition, in
effect on the date of such payment (any costs and expenses described in this
clause (f), the " _Collection Costs_ "). 


 

  (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in  any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent is entitled to
receive the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this _Section
8.2_ , the Company Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Collection Costs
and  Reimbursement Obligations, shall, subject to _Section 9.12_ , be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective
Affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
former, current, or future  general or limited partners, stockholders,
directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, employees, representatives
or agents (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or  agreement in this
Agreement giving rise to such termination, or in respect of any representation
made or alleged to be have been made in connection with this Agreement, and
upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
of  their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, directors, officers, managers, members, Affiliates, employees,
representatives or agents shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of  this Agreement or in respect of
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,  under no
circumstances will Parent or any other Parent Related Parties be entitled to
any monetary damages or other monetary remedies for any losses, damages or
liabilities suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or by Willful Breach or otherwise) or for any representation
made or alleged to have been made in connection  herewith, and Company's and
the other Company Related Parties' maximum aggregate liability in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not in any
case exceed an amount equal to the Liability Cap, other than in the  case of
actual and intentional fraud. 

 

74   (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in  any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and the Company is paid the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ , the Parent
Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Collection Costs and the
Reimbursement  Obligations, shall, subject to _Section 9.12_ , be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, controlling Persons,  managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds,
representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or successors or any
former, current or future general or limited partner, shareholder, 
controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
affiliated (or commonly advised) fund, representative, agent, assignee or
successor of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") or any Debt  Financing Source Related Party for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or
for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any
certificate or other document delivered in connection  herewith or otherwise
or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith and upon payment of such amounts, none of the
Parent Related Parties or Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall  have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or in respect of representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, except that  nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations under
_Section 6.5(b)_ , _Section 6.7_ and _Section 6.16(d)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and without limiting the
Company's rights under _Section          9.12_ , under no
circumstances will the Company be entitled to monetary damages under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby from (i)
Parent in excess of the amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee (and any 
costs, expenses, interest and other amounts payable pursuant to _Section
6.4(g)_ , _Section 6.16(d)_ and _Section 8.2(e)_ ) or (ii) any Parent Related
Parties (other than Parent), other than pursuant to, and in accordance with
the terms  of, the Parent Guarantee, the Equity Financing Commitment or the
Confidentiality Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) under no circumstances will
the Company or any other Company Related  Parties be entitled to any monetary
damages or other monetary remedies for any losses, damages or liabilities
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform  hereunder
(in any case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or by Willful
Breach or otherwise) or for any representation made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith, and Parent's and the other Parent Related
Parties' maximum  aggregate liability in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall not in any case exceed an amount
equal to the Liability Cap, other than in the case of actual and intentional
fraud and (ii) the Company shall be  entitled to seek specific performance to
cause the Closing to occur in accordance with _Section 9.12_ prior to
terminating this Agreement and triggering payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, but the Company shall not be entitled to both specific  performance to
cause the Closing to occur pursuant to _Section 9.12_ and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or any other amounts from Parent or the Parent Related
Parties.

causes of action that may be based upon or under this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto and no
other Parent Related Party,  Debt Financing Source Related Party or Company

Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are materially disproportionately  affected
thereby as compared with other participants operating in the industry in which
the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business (in which case solely the
incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into account in

be expected to, result in or constitute a breach of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, a Party's failure to consummate the Closing when required
pursuant to _Section 1.2_ shall be  a Willful Breach of this Agreement. 


 

 

Section 9.6. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other  provisions hereof. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this 
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any
term or other  provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that  the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 


 

 

Section 9.7. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits hereto and the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule), the Commitment Letters, the Parent  Guarantee and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, 
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of each of the other Parties, and any assignment without such consent
shall be null and  void; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub and, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, may, without the prior written
agreement of any other Party, assign any or all of their respective rights
hereunder to the Debt Financing Sources  (including for collateral security
purposes) so long as Parent remains liable hereunder.

 


 

 

Section 9.8. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to  the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than (a)  with respect to the provisions of
_Section 6.9_ which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities
benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof,
(b) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the  holders of Shares to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (c) at and after the Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of Options, Restricted Stock and RSU Awards to receive the 
payments contemplated by the applicable provisions of _Section 2.2_ at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
and (d) prior to the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Common Stock
to pursue  claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief,
for Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement; _provided_ that the
rights granted to the holders of Common Stock pursuant to the foregoing clause
(d) of this _Section  9.8_ shall only be enforceable on behalf of such
holders by the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties hereto and are for the sole  benefit of the
Parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 9.3_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the 
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the Parties  hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

 

 

83  

Section 9.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to choice of Law principles thereof).

 


 

 

Section 9.10. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this  Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission, ".pdf," or other electronic
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different  Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 


 

 

Section 9.12. _Specific Performance_.

 


 

  (a) Each Party acknowledges that (i) money damages would be an 
insufficient remedy for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by
such Party, (ii) any such breach or threatened breach would cause the other
Party irreparable harm and (iii) in addition to any other remedies available
at Law or in equity  that are expressly provided to a Party under this
Agreement, the Parties will be entitled to equitable relief by way of
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, without posting
any bond or other undertaking, for any actual or  threatened breach of this
Agreement by such Party. Neither Party will (i) contest the appropriateness or
granting of any injunction or specific performance as a remedy for a breach of
this Agreement or (ii) assert that a remedy of specific enforcement  is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy,
subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of _Section 9.12(b)_. 

 

84   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the 
Parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure any actual or threatened
breach, of this Agreement  by Parent or Merger Sub and to cause Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and comply with
its obligations hereunder (including with respect to the Debt Financing).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, the Parties
hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company
shall be entitled to specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to cause Parent to effect the Closing, if but only if (i) all of 
the conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied if the Closing
were to  occur at such time), (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Parent that if specific performance to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the
Closing will occur, (iii) the  amounts committed to be funded under the Debt
Commitment Letter (or the Alternative Financing Commitment Letters) either
have been funded or will be funded (or the conditions to such funding will be
satisfied) at the Closing if the amounts under the  Equity Commitment Letter
are funded at Closing, and (iv) Parent fails to consummate the Closing within
one (1) Business Day after the delivery of the written notice set forth in
clause (ii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
Agreement, while the Company may concurrently seek (i) specific performance or
other equitable relief, subject in all respects to this _Section 9.12_ and
(ii) payment of the Parent Termination Fee or monetary damages in accordance
with _Section          8.2(a)_ , if, as and when required pursuant to
this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded, on the one hand, and payment of the  Parent Termination Fee and/or
any of the other amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ , on the other hand. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary: (x) no Person other than the Company shall  be
entitled to seek specific performance of this Agreement against Parent; and
(y) no Person other than the Company shall be entitled to seek payment of the
Parent Termination Fee and any Collection Costs and Reimbursement
Obligations. 


 

 

Section 9.13. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the  State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or 
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(b) agrees that it will  not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in  any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.4_.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that  service of any
process, summons, notice or document by delivery in person or by overnight
courier to the respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.4_ shall be
effective service of process for any suit or Proceeding in connection with
this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, any  claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this _Section 9.13_ , that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction  of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent  permitted by
applicable Law, that the suit, action or Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit, action or
Proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof
or thereof,  may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any
defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection
of any amount to which the  Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment
of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the
foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of
Delaware and of the United States of  America; _provided_ that each such
Party's consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section 9.13_
is solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section 9.13_ and shall not be
deemed to be a general submission to said  courts or in the State of Delaware
other than for such purpose.

 

 

85  

Section 9.14. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON  CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

 


 

 

Section 9.15. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be  paid by Parent and Merger
Sub when due and Parent and Merger Sub shall prepare and timely file all Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes, and Parent and
Merger Sub will indemnify the Company against liability for any such  Taxes.

 


 

 

Section 9.16. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include",  "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer  to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. References to "dollars" or "$" are to
United States of America dollars. The phrases "transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement", "transactions contemplated hereby" and similar terms shall
refer only to the Merger and the related transactions expressly contemplated
by this Agreement and shall not include the Subsequent Transaction. For the
purposes of _Article  III_ of this Agreement, the term "made available", with
respect to any document or item made available to Parent and its
Representatives, shall mean such document or item has been made available to
Parent and its Representatives in the  electronic data room maintained or via
email or other physical or electronic format by the Company on or before the
time that is one day immediately prior to the Closing Date. References to any
statute, rule or regulation, or any other applicable  Law, shall be deemed to
refer to such statute, rule or regulation, or other applicable Law, as amended
or supplemented from time to time, including through the promulgation of
applicable rules or regulations. References to any Contract are to that 
Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof. The phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if".   This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the Party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

 

 

86  

Section 9.17. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries hereby: (i) agrees that any Proceeding, whether in  Law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any Debt
Financing Sources Related Party, arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements entered into in
connection with the Debt  Financing, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder shall be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long  as such forum is and
remains available, and any appellate court thereof and the Company on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries hereto irrevocably submits itself and its
property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction
of  such court, and such action (except to the extent relating to the
interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement (including any provision in
any documentation related to the Debt Financing that expressly specifies that
the interpretation of such  provisions shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware)) shall be governed by the
Laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of Law
principles that would result in the application  of the Laws of another
jurisdiction), (ii) agrees not to bring or support any action of any kind or
description, whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Sources Related Party in any way 
arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan,  New York, New York, (iii) agrees that service of
process upon the Company or its Subsidiaries in any such action or Proceeding
shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 9.4_ , (iv)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest  extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action in any such
court, (v) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law trial by jury in any  action brought
against the Debt Financing Sources in any way arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (vi) agrees
that  none of the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties will have any
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, other than
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Debt  Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise ( _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing  herein shall affect the rights
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties
with respect to the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby or the rights of the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries
following the Merger), and (vii) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources
Related Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any
of the provisions in this Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in
this _Section          9.17_ or in _Section 8.2(g)_ , _Section 9.2_ ,
_Section 9.3_ , and _Section 9.7_ and such provisions and the definition of
"Debt Financing Sources" and "Debt Financing Sources Related Parties" shall
not be amended, modified  or waived in any way material and adverse to the
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties without the prior written consent of
