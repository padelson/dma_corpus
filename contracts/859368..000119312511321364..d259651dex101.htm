as such Assumed Liabilities become due and payable or are required to be
performed or satisfied in accordance with their respective terms.

 

Section 3.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Buyer shall deliver to Sellers

than the Canadian Assets, on the other hand (the " _Canada-US Allocation_ "),
(ii) for the Canadian Assets, among the province(s) in which the Canadian
Assets are located (the " _Provincial Allocation_ "), (iii) among the Canadian
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations

days after the Closing. Not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver to Sellers the US Asset Allocation. In administering any
Proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court shall not be required to apply the
Allocation Schedule(s) in determining the manner in which the Purchase Price
should be allocated as between any of the US Sellers and their respective
estates or between the US Sellers and their estates and the Canadian Seller
and its estate. In administering the Canadian Proceedings, the Canadian Court
shall not be required to apply the Allocation Schedule(s) in determining the
manner in which the Purchase Price should be allocated as between the US
Sellers and their estates and the Canadian Seller and its estate. Buyer and
Sellers will each file all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS
Forms 8594) consistent with the Allocation Schedule(s) established pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 3.5_ (except to the extent that any Allocation
Schedule is inconsistent with any Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court or the
Canadian Court). Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each
agree to provide the other promptly with any other information required to
complete IRS Forms 8594\. Neither Buyer nor any Seller shall take any Tax
position inconsistent with such Allocation Schedule(s) (except to the extent
that any Allocation Schedule is inconsistent with any Final Order of
the Bankruptcy Court or the Canadian Court) and neither Buyer nor any Seller
shall agree to any proposed adjustment based upon or arising out of Allocation
Schedule(s) by any Governmental Authority without first giving the other Party
prior written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein
shall prevent Buyer or any Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the
Allocation Schedule(s), and neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of such Allocation
Schedule(s). The Allocation Schedule(s) shall be revised in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder to appropriately take
into account any payments made under this Agreement.

Section 3.6 _Withholding_. If Buyer is required by applicable Laws to withhold
or deduct any amount of Tax from the payment of the Purchase Price hereunder,
then Buyer shall withhold or deduct (and, to the extent required by
applicable Laws, remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority) the amount
of any such Tax and such withheld amount shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to Sellers.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

Sellers hereby represent and warrant to Buyer that the statements contained in
this _Article V_ are true and correct:

Section 5.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Each Seller is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. Sellers have the requisite corporate or
limited liability company power and authority to own or lease and to operate
and use its properties and to carry on the Business as now conducted. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 5.1_ , Sellers are duly qualified or licensed to do
business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its business or the nature of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
or in good standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 _Authority; Validity; Consents_. Sellers have, subject to
requisite Bankruptcy Court approval and Canadian Court approval, as
applicable, the requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority necessary to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which each such Seller is a
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Sellers and
each other Transaction Document required to be executed and delivered by
Sellers at the Closing will be duly and validly executed and delivered by
Sellers at the Closing. Subject to requisite Bankruptcy Court approval and
Canadian Court approval, as applicable, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute, with respect to Sellers, the legal, valid
and binding obligations of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance
with their respective terms, except as such enforceability is limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or general
principles of equity. Subject to requisite Bankruptcy Court approval and
Canadian Court approval, as applicable, except (a) as required to comply with
the HSR Act, (b) for entry of the Sale Order or

 



21  the Canadian Sale and Vesting Order and (c) for notices, filings and
consents required in connection with the Bankruptcy Case or the Canadian
Proceedings, Sellers are not required to give any notice to, make any filing
with or obtain any consent from any Person (including any Governmental
Authority) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents or the consummation or performance of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for such notices,
filings and consents, the failure of which to provide, make or obtain, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.3 _No Conflict_. When the consents and other actions described in
_Section 5.2_ have been obtained and taken, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions provided for herein and therein will not result in the material
breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a material
default under, or materially conflict with, or require consent or the giving
of notice under, or cause any acceleration of any material obligation of
Sellers under (a) any Order or (b) any Law.

 

Section 5.4 _Environmental and Health and Safety Matters_. Except as set forth
on _Schedule 5.4_ or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect:

(a) the current operations of the Business at the Real Property comply with
all applicable Laws concerning environmental, health or safety matters ("
_Environmental, Health and Safety Laws_ "), and Sellers have not received
written notice alleging that the activities of the Business are in violation
of any Environmental Health and Safety Laws; and

(b) no Seller has caused any Release of any Hazardous Substances that
requires reporting under applicable Environmental, Health and Safety Laws at,
on or under any of the Real Property, and, to Sellers Knowledge, none of such
properties has been used by any Person as a landfill or storage, treatment
or disposal site for any type of Hazardous Substance or non-hazardous solid
wastes as defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as
amended.

Section 5.5 _Title to Acquired Assets_. Sellers have, and, immediately prior
to Closing, will have, and, upon delivery to Buyer on the Closing Date of the
instruments of transfer contemplated by  _Section 4.3_, and subject to the
terms of the Sale Order and the Canadian Sale and Vesting Order, Sellers will
thereby transfer to Buyer, good title to, or, in the case of personal property
leased by Sellers, a valid leasehold interest in, all of the Acquired Assets
material to the Business, taken as a whole, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except (a) as set forth on _Schedule 5.5_, (b) for the Assumed
Liabilities, (c) for Permitted Encumbrances, and (d) subject to the
limitation that certain transfers, assignments, licenses, sublicenses, leases
and subleases, as the case may be, of Acquired Assets, Assigned Agreements and
Permits, and any claim or right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, may require consent of a Person or Governmental Authority, which
has not been obtained.

Section 5.6  _Taxes_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.6_ , all income and
other material Tax Returns required to be filed by Sellers have been timely
filed (taking into account any extension of time to file granted, or to be
obtained with respect thereto), and all such Tax Returns

 



22  are complete and accurate in all material respects. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.6_ , on the Effective Date (a) no examination by any Governmental
Authority of any such Tax Return is currently in progress; and (b) no
material Tax deficiencies of Sellers are being claimed, proposed or assessed
by any Governmental Authority. All material amounts of Tax due and payable by
Sellers have been duly and timely paid. There are no liens for Taxes on any
of the Acquired Assets other than Permitted Encumbrances.

Section 5.7 _Legal Proceedings_. As of the date hereof, except for the
Bankruptcy Case, the Canadian Proceedings and as set forth on _Schedule 5.7_,
there is no Proceeding or Order pending, outstanding or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened against any Seller that (a) seeks to restrain or
prohibit or otherwise challenge the consummation, legality or validity of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2006, there has not
been made or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened, any material product
liability or other material product-related claims by any third party arising
from the sale, distribution or manufacturing with respect to the safety
of the Products of any Product and, to Sellers Knowledge, there are no
material safety concerns with respect to any Product.

 

Section 5.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as set forth in _Schedule
5.8_, Sellers are not, and since January 1, 2009, have not been in violation
in any material respect of any Law applicable to the operation of the Business
and hold all Permits required for Sellers to conduct the Business as it is
currently conducted. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 5.8_, there are no
Proceedings pending, or to Sellers Knowledge threatened, regarding any of the
Permits, except where the failure to hold the same or such Proceedings
regarding the same would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the
conduct of the Business as currently conducted. Sellers are in compliance with
the terms of all Permits, except for such non-compliance as would not
reasonably be expected to materially impair the conduct of the Business
as currently conducted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.8_
shall not apply to environmental and health and safety matters, Taxes or
regulatory matters, which are the subject exclusively of the representations
and warranties in  _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.6_ and _Section 5.11_,

registration, maintenance and renewal documentation and fees in connection
with the applicable material Registered Business Intellectual Property have
been timely filed with the appropriate authorities and paid. Sellers have in
place commercially reasonable policies and procedures, consistent with
industry standards, to maintain the secrecy of all Trade Secrets included in
the Business Intellectual Property. To Sellers Knowledge, the Business is not
using any material Registered Business Intellectual Property in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to result in the cancellation or unenforceability
of such material Registered Business Intellectual Property.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(c)_ , there are no claims, actions,
suits or proceedings before any court, tribunal or other Governmental
Authority with respect to the Registered Business Intellectual Property or
Material Unregistered Trademarks (other than proceedings related to usual and
customary patent or trademark prosecutions in the Ordinary Course of
Business, including with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or
equivalent foreign or multi-national authority).

 

(d) Except as disclosed on _Schedule 5.9(d)_ , to Sellers Knowledge (i) the

otherwise violating any Business Intellectual Property, and no claims with
respect to any such infringement or violation are pending or threatened
against any Person by Sellers.

 

Section 5.10 _Assigned Agreements_. Each Assigned Agreement listed or

binding obligation of Sellers and, to Sellers Knowledge, the other parties
thereto, in accordance with its terms and conditions, in each case except (a)
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to creditors rights generally or general principles of equity and (b) as set
forth on _Schedule 5.10_. Sellers have made available to Buyer correct and

payment of the Cure Costs and except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10_ , (i) no
Seller will be in material breach or default of its obligations under any
such Assigned Agreement, (ii) no condition exists that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a material default by any Seller under any such
Assigned Agreement and (iii) to Sellers Knowledge, no other party to any
such Assigned Agreement is in material breach or default thereunder. Other

from time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), _Schedule

adverse effect on the Business as currently conducted.

 

(b) Sellers hold Product Registrations required for the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted by Sellers, and such Product Registrations
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to hold a Product
Registration would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to materially impair the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted. Sellers have fulfilled and performed, and are performing, all of
their material obligations with respect to the Product Registrations, and no
event has occurred which allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow,
revocation or termination thereof or results in any other impairment of the
rights of the holder of any Product Registration, except where the failure to

Health Canada or any other Governmental Authority, failed to disclose a
material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA, Health Canada or any other
Governmental Authority, or committed an act, made a statement, or failed to
make a statement that, at the time such disclosure was made, would reasonably
be expected to provide a basis for the FDA, Health Canada or any other
Governmental Authority to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities," set
forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (Sept. 10, 1991) or any similar policy. To
Sellers Knowledge, no officer, employee, or agent of Sellers has engaged in

available to Buyer in any "data rooms," "data sites," responses to inquiries,
confidential information memoranda or management presentations in expectation
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document. Any documents, title information, assessments,
surveys, plans, specifications, reports and studies, or other information made
available to Buyer by Sellers or their Representatives, including any
other material made available to Buyer in any "data rooms," "data sites,"
responses to inquiries, confidential information memoranda or management
presentations (collectively, " _Review Documents_ ") are provided
as information only. Buyer shall not rely upon Sellers provision of any
Review Document(s) in lieu of conducting its own due diligence. Except for the
specific representations and warranties contained in this _Article V _(in
each case as modified by the Disclosure Schedules hereto), Sellers have not
made, do not make, and have not authorized anyone else to make any
representation as to: (i) the accuracy, reliability or completeness of any of
the Review Documents; (ii) the operating condition of the Acquired Assets;
(iii) the environmental conditions of the Real Property INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ANY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES; (iv) the
enforceability of, or Buyers ability to obtain the benefits of, any
agreement of record affecting the Acquired Assets, (v) the transferability or
assignability of any Contract or Permit or (vi) any other matter or thing
affecting or relating to the Acquired Assets.

(b) In connection with investigation by Buyer, Buyer has received or may
receive from Sellers certain projections, forward-looking statements and
other forecasts and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans), and that Buyer shall have no claim against anyone with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, without limiting any
representation or warranty in this  _Article V_ or any other term of this
agreement, Sellers make no representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans).

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Sellers that the statements contained
in this _Article VI_ are true and correct:

Section 6.1  _Organization and Good Standing_. Buyer is a corporation, duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Buyer has the requisite power and authority to own or lease and
to operate and use its properties and to carry on its business as now
conducted.

 



28 Section 6.2 _Authority; Validity; Consents_. Buyer has the requisite power
and authority necessary to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Buyer and the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate actions in respect thereof. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer and each
other Transaction Document to which Buyer is a party will be duly and validly
executed and delivered by Buyer at the Closing. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party constitute the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms, except as such enforceability is limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally or general
principles of equity. Except as required to comply with the HSR Act and
Investment Canada Act, Buyer is not and will not be required to give any
notice to or obtain any consent from any Person in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party or the consummation or performance of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

Section 6.3 _No Conflict_. When the consents and other actions described in
_Section 6.2_ have been obtained and taken, the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions provided for herein and therein will not result in the breach of
any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, or
conflict with, or cause any acceleration of any obligation of Buyer under (a)
any agreement, indenture, or other instrument to which it is bound, (b) the
certificate incorporation of Buyer, (c) any Order or (d) any Law.

Section 6.4 _Availability of Funds; Solvency_.

funds (without giving effect to any unfunded financing, regardless of whether
any such financing is committed) to pay the Cash Consideration, and all other
costs, fees and expenses required to be paid by it under this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents.

 

(b) As of the Closing and immediately after consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, Buyer will not, assuming the accuracy of Sellers
representations and warranties under this Agreement, (i) be insolvent (either
because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater
than the fair value of its assets or because the present fair value of its
assets will be less than the amount required to pay its probable Liability on
its debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) have unreasonably
small capital with which to engage in its business or (iii) have incurred or
plan to incur debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become
absolute and matured.

Section 6.5 _Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened, that would affect in any material respect
Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

behalf of Buyer has paid or become obligated to pay any fee or commission to
any broker, finder, investment banker, agent or intermediary for or on account
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Sellers are or
will become liable, and Buyer shall hold harmless and indemnify Sellers from
any claims with respect to any such fees or commissions.

ACTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

Section 7.1 _Investigation of the Business by Buyer_. After the Effective Date

and in accordance with reasonable procedures to be established in good faith
by mutual agreement of Sellers Interim Access Manager and Buyers Interim
Access Manager, (a) afford Buyers authorized Representatives access during
normal business hours to the offices, properties, key employees, outside

requests of Buyer shall be submitted only by Gary Tanner or another individual
reasonably acceptable to Sellers Interim Access Manager as Gary Tanners
successor, as Buyers designated representative (" _Buyer s Interim Access
Manager_"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access,
information or cooperation shall be permitted or required to the extent that
it would require Sellers to disclose information subject to attorney-client
privilege or would be prohibited by Law or would otherwise contravene any
antitrust or competition Law.

Section 7.2 _Operations Prior to the Closing Date_. Sellers covenant and agree
that, except (i) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) as

Ordinary Course of Business (including by

 



30  paying all fees due to any regulatory authority in the Ordinary Course of
Business, including all fees due to the FDA or Health Canada prior to
Closing), to maintain in full force and effect the Permits, to maintain and
preserve the Acquired Assets in their present condition, other than reasonable
wear and tear, and to keep intact the business relationships relating to the
Acquired Assets; and, without limiting the generality of the forgoing,

(b) Sellers shall not:

Acquired Asset;

 

(ii) issue, deliver or sell or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of,
any membership or other equity interests of Sellers;

(including all strengths and methods of delivery) in any given week or
materially increase the sale of other Products outside of the Ordinary Course

(viii) enter into any agreement or commitment to take any action prohibited by
this _Section 7.2_.

Without in any way limiting any Partys rights or obligations under this
Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that (i) nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of Sellers, or the Business prior to the

 



31  Closing and (ii) prior to the Closing, Sellers shall exercise, consistent
with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over the Business and their operations.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall be permitted to
take all actions that are necessary or desirable to comply with the WARN Act,
including without limitation, providing any notices required under the WARN
Act, and no such actions shall constitute a violation of this _Section 7.2_.

(a) Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_, within fifteen (15) Business Days following
the Effective Date, Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall each prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any
notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act with the United States
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, and request early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. Buyer, on the one hand,
and Sellers, on the other hand, shall as soon as reasonably practicable
respond to any requests for additional information in connection with such
filings and shall take all other actions necessary to cause the waiting
periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest practicable
date after the date of filing. Buyer shall be responsible for payment of the
applicable filing fee under the HSR Act.

 

(b) In addition to the actions to be taken under _Section 7.3(a)_, Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use all best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in _Article IX _and
_Article X _to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary Governmental
Authorizations and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to avoid
any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority, (iii) the defending of any
Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental

hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Buyer further agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain the

conditions set forth in _Article IX _and _Article X_, as applicable, or to
avoid the entry of or have lifted, vacated or terminated any Closing Legal
Impediment, take the following actions: (i) propose, negotiate, offer to
commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, and in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, the sale,

 



32  divestiture or disposition (including by licensing any intellectual property
rights) of any Acquired Assets and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in entities with assets or businesses); (ii) terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights and obligations; (iii) otherwise offer to
take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and,
if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action, that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
Acquired Assets and/or any other assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (or equity interests held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
entities with assets or businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would
make consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents unlawful or that would prevent or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the
posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) of this  _Section 7.3(c)_) necessary to vacate, modify or suspend
such injunction or order. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers obligations
under this _Section 7.3 _shall be absolute and not qualified by "commercially
reasonable efforts." The Parties agree that Sellers obligations under this
_Section 7.3 _shall not include any obligation on the part of Sellers or
their respective Affiliates to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust or otherwise the sale or disposition of such of its
assets or businesses (including the Acquired Assets) as may be required to be
divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any suit or preceding.

(d) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, (i) shall
promptly inform each other of any communication from any Governmental
Authority concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any filing, notification or request for approval and (ii) shall permit the
other to review in advance any proposed written or material oral communication
or information submitted to any such Governmental Authority in response
thereto and shall discuss and attempt to reasonably account for any comments
or suggestions of the other Party. In addition, none of Parties shall agree
to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such Party consults with the
other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by any such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat, in each case to the maximum extent practicable. Subject
to any restrictions under applicable laws, rules or regulations, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish the other with copies
of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on the one hand, and the Governmental Authority or
members of its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications
which are subject to preexisting confidentiality agreements or to the
attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine) or any such filing,
notification or request for approval. In carrying out their obligations under
this _Section 7.3_, subject to applicable Law, each of the Parties shall not
submit or otherwise provide any information to such Governmental Authority
without first having provided a reasonable opportunity to the other Party and
its counsel to comment upon such information. Each Party shall also furnish
the other Party with such

 



33  necessary information and assistance as such other Party and its Affiliates
may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of necessary
filings, registration or submissions of information to the Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and any such filing, notification or request for approval. Any Party
may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any sensitive
material provided to the other Party under this _Section 7.3_, or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement, as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
the directors, officers or employees of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

 

(e) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall, after the entry of the Sale Order, agree
to accept any agreement that would have the effect of delaying the
consummation of any action contemplated by this Agreement without the written
consent of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall commit
to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Laws,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

 

(f) Neither Buyer nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall take any action
or acquire any assets or securities of any other Person or agree to acquire
assets or securities of any other Person if such action, acquisition or
agreement would reasonably be expected to impair Buyers ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.4 _Bankruptcy Court Filings and Approval_.

(a) US Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry
of the Sale Order and such other relief from the Bankruptcy Court as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer agrees
that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by US
Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the Sale Order and, consistent with 
_Section 8.3(a)_ below, a finding by the Bankruptcy Court of adequate
assurance of future performance by Buyer.

(b) As promptly as possible, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
following entry of the Sale Order and on notice to Persons designated by
Buyer, Canadian Seller shall bring a motion seeking an Order in the Canadian
Proceeding, _inter alia_ , (i) approving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein, (ii) exempting the transaction from the provisions of the
Bulk Sales Act (Ontario), and (iii) vesting the Canadian Assets in Buyer free
and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) effective upon delivery to Buyer of the Receivers Certificate
confirming that the Purchase Price has been paid, the conditions to Closing
have been satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement have closed to the satisfaction of the Receiver (such order, the "
_Canadian Sale and Vesting Order_ "), which Order shall be substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , with such changes as Buyer may
accept acting reasonably. Buyer agrees that it will take such actions as are
reasonably requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the Canadian
Sale and Vesting Order.

 



34 (c) Prior to the filing by Sellers of the applications and motions for the
Canadian Orders, Sellers will (i) provide a copy thereof (including, in each
case, the related forms of order and notice and supporting materials) to Buyer
and its counsel, (ii) provide Buyer and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document, and any amendment or supplement
thereto and (iii) incorporate any reasonable comments of Buyer and its counsel
into such document and any amendment or supplement thereto.

 

(d) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the
Acquired Assets and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Agreements
are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and approval of the Canadian Court.
Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, Sellers must
demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the highest and
otherwise best offer possible for the Acquired Assets and (ii) Buyer must
provide adequate assurance of future performance under the Assigned Agreements
to be assigned by US Sellers.

 

(e) Sellers shall give appropriate notice, and provide appropriate opportunity
for hearing, to all Persons entitled thereto, of all motions (including the
motions seeking entry of the Sale Order and the Canadian Orders), orders,
hearings and other proceedings relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and such additional notice as ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court or the Canadian Court or as Buyer may reasonably request.

(f) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from the Sale Order or any of the Canadian Orders, Sellers shall immediately
notify Buyer of such appeal or stay request and shall provide to Buyer
promptly a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of stay. Sellers
shall also provide Buyer with written notice of any motion or application
filed in connection with any appeal from or stay request in respect of either
of such orders. Sellers and Buyer shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such appeal or stay request and obtain an
expedited resolution of such appeal.

(g) After entry of the Sale Order and the Canadian Sale and Vesting Order
Sellers shall not take any action which is intended to, or fail to take any
action the intent of which failure to act is to, result in the reversal,
voiding, modification or staying of the Sale Order or the Canadian Sale and
Vesting Order.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
subject to the fourth sentence of _Section 2.5_, at the request of Buyer,
Sellers shall transfer and assign the Assigned Agreements set forth on
_Schedule 7.4(h)_ to Buyer as of the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as
possible, pursuant to, inter alia, Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, it
being agreed that such assumption and assignment may occur after the Sale
Hearing and entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order.

 

Section 7.5 _Communications with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
not to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise communicate with,
any of Sellers landlords, clients, suppliers and other Persons with which
Sellers have material commercial dealings without obtaining the prior consent
of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided that nothing herein shall in any way restrict or limit Buyer
or its Affiliates from

 



35  contacting, or engaging in discussions or otherwise communicating with, any
Person in the ordinary course of the business of Buyer and its Affiliates as
conducted as of the date hereof. In no event shall Buyer request any client,
customer or any other Person to return any Products sold by Seller.

 

Section 7.6 _Financing_. Buyer covenants and agrees with Sellers that it will
take all actions necessary to ensure that as of the Closing Date Buyer will
have immediately available funds, in the aggregate, sufficient to pay the Cash
Consideration, and all other costs, fees and expenses required to be paid by
it under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

Section 7.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the Effective Date through
one (1) Business Day prior to the Sale Hearing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (and in no event later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Sale Hearing, except with respect to Contracts
entered into after such date) supplement or update  _Schedule 2.2(d)_ by
providing Buyer written notice of any Contract to which any Seller is a party
as of the Effective Date which was not set forth on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ or
_Schedule 2.2(d)_ as of the Effective Date and any Contracts that relate to
the Business and arise in the Ordinary Course of Business after the Effective
Date. From the Effective Date through one (1) Business Day prior to the Sale
Hearing, Buyer may amend _Schedule 2.2(d)_ or _Schedule 1.1(a)_  to move any
Contract from _Schedule 2.2(d)_ to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , but not vice versa,
_provided_ , _however_ , that from the Effective Date through two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to move any Contract
set forth on Schedule 7.7 from Schedule 1.1(a) to Schedule 2.2(d), _provided_
, _further_ , that Buyer shall have no right to add any Contract rejected, in

Sellers receiving written notice from Buyer to include such Contract on
_Schedule 1.1(a)_ so long as Sellers have provided Buyer with notice of
Sellers intent to reject any such Contract at least two (2) days prior to
rejecting such Contract, _provided further_ , that Buyer may not amend
_Schedule 2.2(d)_ or _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to move any Contract from _Schedule
1.1(a)_ to _Schedule 2.2(d)_ which is also listed on _Schedule 5.15_ without
the prior written consent of Sellers.

United States are tracked with Buyer Required Code. Buyer will not sell or
otherwise transfer any Products in the United States that have a label or
packaging that includes any Seller NDC Number. On or following the Closing,
Buyer shall take all necessary actions, including, without limitation,
completion of the filings and submissions contemplated by _Section 8.5_, to
have the current DIN for each Product in Canada assigned to Buyer and Canadian
Seller shall agree to such assignments. Each party hereby agrees and
undertakes to provide to the other party copies of all written notices and
information filed or delivered by such party to Health Canada in furtherance
of the foregoing. For greater certainty, subject to compliance with the filing
requirements contemplated by _Section 8.5(a)_, from and after the Closing,
Buyer may sell or transfer Products in Canada bearing the current DIN for each
Product in Canada, and Buyer shall not be required to obtain a new DIN for
each such Product, except for Products that received a DIN prior to September
1994 and have not been notified.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer will
issue a joint letter to customers of the Products, advising such customers of
Sellers and Buyers responsibilities in connection with returns and credits.
Sellers shall be responsible only for returned Product that bears Sellers NDC
Number or as evidenced as being sold by Sellers prior to the Closing by lot
number or otherwise, _provided_ that, any processing of returns of Product
shall be in compliance with Sellers return policy. Buyer shall be responsible
only for returned Product that bears the Buyers NDC Number or as evidenced
as being sold by Buyer on or after the Closing Date by lot number or
otherwise, _provided_ that, any such returns of Product shall be in compliance
with Buyers then current return policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Product returns in Canada involve a split lot of Product, a portion of which
was sold by Canadian Seller prior to the Closing and a portion of which was
sold by Buyer after the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for returns of
all Product from such split lot. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall take any
action to encourage or delay return of any Product. If Sellers or Buyer
receive a Product for which the other was responsible as set forth in 
_Section 8.4(b)_, that party shall ship the returned Product to the
responsible party at the expense of the responsible party, together with such
information as is necessary to support the return. All payments due to Sellers
from Buyer or due to Buyer from Sellers under this _Section 8.4(b)_, shall
be made within 30 days of

 



38  submission to the responsible party of invoices that describe the requested
payment in reasonable detail.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall have the responsibility to process, and shall have all
Liability for, all Rebates and Chargebacks for Products sold by Buyer.
Sellers shall retain all Liability for Rebates and Chargebacks relating to
Products sold by Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the
responsibility to process, and shall have all Liability for, Rebates charged
by a Canadian Governmental Authority for Products dispensed during the first
calendar quarter of 2012 or later and invoiced in the second calendar quarter
of 2012 or later, regardless of whether such Rebates relate to Products sold
by Canadian Seller or Buyer.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or _Section 8.5_, or
being limited thereby, after the Closing, Buyer shall make all appropriate
filings and submissions with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, any
Canadian programs and other Government Authorities in regard to all
Chargebacks and Rebates owing to such Government Authorities for Products
sold by Buyer, including without limitation updates to Buyers Medicaid Drug
Rebate Agreement and any required filings. Sellers shall bear no
responsibility for Buyers failure to make such filings and submissions or
any delays resulting therefrom.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 8.4 _shall prohibit Sellers from ceasing
operations or winding up their affairs following the Closing.

Section 8.5 _Transfer of Regulatory Matters_. 

(a) Promptly after the Closing and in any event within one (1) day after the
Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall file with the FDA, Health Canada or other
Governmental Authority the notices and information required pursuant to any
applicable regulation or requirement, such as 21 C.F.R. § 314.72, or any
successor regulation thereto, to transfer the Product Registrations from
Sellers to Buyer. The Parties also agree to use all commercially reasonable
efforts, and in any event within thirty (30) days following the Closing, to
take any and all other actions required by the FDA, Health Canada, or other
Governmental Authority, if any, to effect the transfer of the Product
Registrations from Sellers to Buyer. For greater certainty, Buyer may not
market or sell Products in Canada prior to completion of the filings of the
required notices and information contemplated by the first sentence of this
_Section 8.5(a)_.

(b) Promptly after the Closing and in any event within thirty (30) days after
the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall make all appropriate filings and
submissions with Governmental Authorities, including but not limited to, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the FDA and Health Canada, to
register NDC Numbers and DINs and transfer all regulatory responsibilities,
excluding all Excluded Liabilities, attaching thereto of each Product, from
Sellers to Buyer.

 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 8.5(a)_ and _Section 8.5(b)_, from and
after the Closing, Buyer, at its cost, shall be solely responsible and liable
for (i) taking all actions, paying all fees and conducting all communication
with the appropriate Governmental Authority required by any Law in respect of
the Product Registrations, including preparing and filing all reports

 



39  (including adverse drug experience reports) with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, (ii) paying all future Chargebacks and Rebates due to
any Governmental Authority for Products sold by Buyer, (iii) taking all
actions and conducting all communication with Third Parties in respect of
Products sold by Buyer, including responding to (A) complaints in respect
thereof, including complaints related to tampering or contamination, and (B)
all medical information requests, (iv) investigating all complaints and
adverse drug experiences in respect of such Products, _provided further_ that
nothing in this _Section 8.5(c)_ shall prohibit Sellers from ceasing
operations or winding up their affairs following the Closing.

(d) Subject to _Section 12.15_, Sellers shall be solely responsible and
liable for all Chargebacks and Rebates due to any Governmental Authority for
Products bearing Sellers NDC Number.

Section 8.6 _Adverse Event Reporting_. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall
promptly notify the other of any significant adverse events that relate to the
Products or are required in accordance with any Law, including adverse drug
experiences and governmental inquiries, and each of Buyer and Sellers shall
cooperate with the other in connection therewith as reasonably requested by
the other Party and as follows:

 

(a) Serious Adverse Events related to any Product of which Sellers become
aware shall be submitted to Buyer within three (3) Business Days but no more
than four (4) calendar days from the date Sellers first become aware of such
Serious Adverse Event. Non-Serious Adverse Events for any Product that are
reported to Sellers shall be submitted to Buyer no more than one (1) month
from the date received by Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that medical and
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical
events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to
prevent a Serious Adverse Event outcome. In no event shall Sellers submit to
Buyer any adverse event report or similar information that does not relate to
the Products.

(b) Until the reporting procedures referenced in _Section 8.6(d)_ herein
have been instituted by Buyer and Sellers, a " _Serious Adverse Event_ " for
any Product shall have the meaning set forth in 21 C.F.R. § 314.80(a), as
amended from time to time, and a " _Non-Serious Adverse Event_ " for any
Product is defined any adverse event that is not a Serious Adverse Event.

 

(c) As provided in _Section 8.5(c)_ above, from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for reporting adverse events related to the
Products to Governmental Authorities to the extent required by applicable
Laws.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer and
Sellers shall discuss and develop mutually acceptable guidelines and
procedures for the receipt, recordation, reporting, communication (as between
the Parties) and exchange of Serious Adverse Event and Non-Serious Adverse
Event information, as applicable, to the other Party; _provided_ that Buyer
shall have exclusive responsibility for communications with Governmental
Authorities concerning the Products and related Serious Adverse Event and
Non-Serious Adverse Event information. The Parties shall bear their respective
costs incurred in connection with receiving, recording, reviewing, reporting,
communicating and exchanging with each other 

 



40  regarding and, as applicable, reporting and responding to Serious Adverse
Events and Non-Serious Adverse Events.

Section 8.7 _Use of Sellers  Brand_. Other than as expressly provided in this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, Buyer will have no right, title,
interest, license or any other right whatsoever in or to, and shall not use
or permit any of its Affiliates to use, the name "Graceway" or any names,
words, service marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos,
emblems, signs, insignia or other business identifiers containing or
comprising the foregoing, including any derivations, translations,
modifications or alterations thereof, or any word, name or mark confusingly
similar thereto (the " _Sellers  Brand_"); _provided_  that Sellers hereby
grant to Buyer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited
right and license to use, Sellers Brand (a) as it appears on existing (as of
the Closing Date) Labeling and packaging for existing Inventory purchased
hereunder, and (b) on Labeling and packaging for Products sold in Canada
following the Closing (whether or not such Products are Inventory purchased
hereunder or manufactured following the Closing), in each case for a period of
time ending on the one hundred eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and any of
their Affiliates for any claims (other than claims resulting from the gross
negligence of Sellers or any of their Affiliates or representatives) arising
from or relating to the use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Sellers
Brand pursuant to this _Section 8.7_. The Parties agree that damages would be
an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach of this _Section 8.7_, and
that a Person seeking to enforce this _Section 8.7_ shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach hereof
in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 8.8 _Post-Closing Books and Records and Personnel_. For seven (7)
years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by any
Governmental Authority or ongoing claim), (a) neither Buyer nor any Seller
shall dispose of or destroy any of the business records and files of
the Business and (b) Buyer and Sellers (including, for clarity, any trust
established under a Chapter 11 plan of Sellers or any other successors of
Sellers) shall allow each other and their respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance
notice, to all employees, files and any books and records and other materials
included in the Acquired Assets for purposes relating to the Bankruptcy Case,
the Canadian Proceedings, the wind-down of the operations of Sellers, the
functions of any such trusts or successors, or other reasonable business
purposes, including Tax matters, governmental contracts, litigation, or
potential litigation, each as it relates to any Product, the Business,
the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities prior to the Closing Date
(with respect to Sellers) or from and after the Closing Date (with respect to
the Buyer), and Buyer and Sellers (including any such trust or successors) and
such Representatives shall have the right to make copies of any such files,
books, records and other materials. In addition, from and after the Closing
for a period of 60 days, Sellers will permit Buyer and its Representatives
access to such personnel of Sellers during normal business hours as Buyer may
reasonably request to assist with the transfer of the Inventory, Permits,
Documents, Business Intellectual Property and Product Registrations,
_provided_ that (i) nothing in this _Section 8.8_ shall prohibit Sellers
from ceasing operations or winding up their affairs following the Closing,
(ii) Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenditure or obligation incurred by Sellers after the
Closing directly related to assistance provided pursuant to this _Section
8.8_ with the transfer and integration of the Inventory, Permits, Documents,
Business Intellectual Property and Product

 



41  Registrations, and (iii) the provisions of this _Section 8.8_ are
acknowledged and agreed by the Parties to be in addition to, and in no way
limit, the provisions of  _Section 2.6_.

Section 8.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Sellers agree not to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its employees not to, divulge to any Person (other than Buyer or its
Affiliates or any persons employed or designated by such entities), publish or
make use of any information of any type whatsoever of a confidential nature
relating to the Products or the Acquired Assets, including, without
limitation, all types of trade secrets, client lists or information,
information regarding product development, marketing plans, management
organization information, operating policies or manuals, performance results,
packaging design or other financial, commercial, business or technical
information, except (i) such knowledge or information that is in the public
domain through no wrongful act by any Seller without the prior written consent
of Buyer or its Affiliates (as the case may be), (ii) for disclosure made
pursuant to and in accordance with any Contract to which any Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller is a party, and (iii) as required by applicable law, by an
order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under subpoena from an
appropriate government agency. This confidentiality provision has no temporal
or geographical limitation.

 

(b) Sellers and Buyer hereby agree that the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
April 29, 2011, between Graceway Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Medicis
Pharmaceutical Corporation shall terminate, and no party shall have any
further obligations thereunder, effective concurrently with the Closing.

Section 8.10 _Nycomed Litigation_. After the Closing Date, if Buyer receives
any proceeds, judgments, payments, expense reimbursements, property or rights
(without regard to how any such items are characterized by a court,
arbitrator, agreement or the parties to the Nycomed Litigation and
specifically including, but not limited, to rights to future royalties or
revenue streams, license or cross-licensing rights, marketing
rights, services, or any other rights the value of which can be reasonably
ascertained or estimated) relating to or arising from the final resolution of
all or any portion of the Nycomed Litigation, the value of such proceeds,
judgments, payments, expense reimbursements, property or rights (the "
_Nycomed Award Amount_ "), such Nycomed Award Amount shall be distributed as
follows:

(a) first, any such proceeds up to an aggregate amount of $3 million shall be
transferred to Sellers in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds;

 

(b) second, Buyer shall retain any additional proceeds up to the amount of
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by
Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the Nycomed Litigation;

(c) third, Buyer shall transfer any additional proceeds to Sellers, in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, up to an amount, when taken
together with the $3 million of proceeds transferred to Sellers pursuant to
_Section 8.10(a)_, that equals the amount of reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by Sellers prior to the Closing in
connection with the Nycomed Litigation (which shall in no event exceed
$9,000,000); and

 



42 (d) fourth, Buyer shall (i) retain 50% of any additional proceeds and (ii)
transfer the remaining 50% of such proceeds to Sellers in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

 

Within ten (10) Business Days after indefeasible receipt by Buyer of any funds
constituting Sellers portion of the Nycomed Award Amount, Buyers shall pay
to US Sellers in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds an
amount equal to the amount apportioned to Sellers above (or the applicable
portion thereof). To the extent all or any portion of the Nycomed Award
Amount may be payable to Buyers in future increments. Buyers and Sellers shall
negotiate in good faith appropriate arrangements for the payment to Sellers of
Sellers portion of such delayed payments either (x) over time as
such amounts are received by Buyers or (y) as a single lump sum of the agreed
net present value of such payment streams. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall have full control over the defense of the Nycomed Litigation and any
decisions related thereto, including any potential settlements, and Sellers
shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with such defense. On and after the
Closing Date, Buyers shall keep Sellers informed of any material developments
in the Nycomed Litigation including any settlement offers and acceptances.
Buyer shall provide Sellers reasonably detailed information, including copies
of any related settlement agreement or license agreement as well as supporting
documents and materials, related to any resolution (whether or not
appealable) of the matters related to the Nycomed Litigation, and Buyer shall
allow Sellers reasonable access to employees and outside counsel of Buyer to
resolve any questions or ambiguities related to such information.

 

Section 8.11 _Acquired Assets "AS IS"; Buyer s Acknowledgment Regarding
Same_. Buyer agrees, warrants and represents that (a) Buyer is purchasing the
Acquired Assets on an "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" basis based solely on
Buyers own investigation of the Acquired Assets and (b) except as set forth
in this Agreement, neither Sellers nor any Representative of Sellers have
made any warranties, representations or guarantees, express, implied or
statutory, written or oral, respecting the Acquired Assets, any part of the
Acquired Assets, the financial performance of the Acquired Assets or the
Business, or the physical condition of the Acquired Assets. Buyer further
acknowledges that the consideration for the Acquired Assets specified in this
Agreement has been agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer after good-faith arms-
length negotiation in light of Buyers agreement to purchase the Acquired
Assets "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS." Buyer agrees, warrants and represents
that, except as set forth in this Agreement, Buyer has relied, and shall
rely, solely upon its own investigation of all such matters, and that Buyer
assumes all risks with respect thereto. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT,
SELLERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT, OR INFORMATION
MADE, COMMUNICATED, OR FURNISHED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO BUYER OR ITS
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES (INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION,
OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO BUYER BY ANY DIRECTOR,
OFFICER, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, AGENT, CONSULTANT, OR REPRESENTATIVE OF SELLERS OR
ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES). EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO BUYER REGARDING THE PROBABLE SUCCESS,
PROFITABILITY OR VALUE OF ANY OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS.

Section 12.3 _Waiver_. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power, or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no waiver
that may be given by a Party shall be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given, and (b) no notice to or demand on one Party
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right of the Party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand.

 

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and the Exhibits) and the other Transaction Documents supersede all
prior agreements between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand, with respect to its subject matter and constitute a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms of the agreements between Buyer, on the
one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, with respect to their subject
matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement
executed by all of the Parties.

Section 12.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement, and the rights, interests and
obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned by any Party by operation of law
or otherwise without the express written consent of the other Parties (which
consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of such other
Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be permitted, upon prior
notice to Sellers, to assign all or part of its rights or obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its
obligations under this Agreement, and Sellers shall be permitted to assign all
or part of their rights or obligations hereunder pursuant to a plan
of reorganization or liquidation approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Section 12.6 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability.

 

Section 12.7 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, the Parties shall bear their own respective
expenses (including all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent

 



50  accountants) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (except as otherwise specified herein).

 

Section 12.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue; Jury Trial
Waiver_.

 

(a) Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or
the provisions of the CJA or other Laws applicable in the Canadian
Proceedings apply, this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts
made and to be performed entirely in such state without regard to principles
of conflicts or choice of laws or any other law that would make the laws of
any other jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware applicable hereto.

(b) Without limitation of any Partys right to appeal any Order of the
Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction
to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes
which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any
breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby (except
for such matters as must be dealt with by the Canadian Court in the Canadian
Proceedings) and (ii) any and all claims relating to the foregoing shall be
filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby
consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Bankruptcy Court and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of any such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
the Bankruptcy Case is closed, all Proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be heard and determined in a Delaware state court or a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, and the Parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in
any such Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any such Proceeding. The Parties consent to
service of process by mail (in accordance with _Section 12.2_) or any other
manner permitted by law.

 

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
SELLERS OR BUYER OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NEGOTIATION OR
PERFORMANCE HEREOF.

 

Section 12.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendment hereto may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original of this Agreement or such amendment and all of which, when taken
together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 12.2_, delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto by telecopier, facsimile or email attachment shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or such
amendment, as applicable. 

Section 12.10 _Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted

 



51  assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable benefit, claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind. 

Section 12.11 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, manager,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, unitholder, partner or equityholder
of any Seller shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of
Sellers under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, and Buyer hereby covenants, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, not to sue any past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, unitholder, partner or equityholder of any
Seller for any such claim.

Section 12.12 _Schedules; Materiality_. The inclusion of any matter in
any Schedule shall be deemed to be an inclusion for all purposes of this
Agreement, to the extent that such disclosure is sufficient to identify the
Section to which such disclosure is responsive, but inclusion therein shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material or creates a measure for materiality for purposes of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any particular fact or item in any Schedule shall
not be deemed an admission as to whether the fact or item is "material" or
would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."

Section 12.13  _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) irreparable injury, for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the specific terms
hereof or are otherwise breached, and (b) the non-breaching Party or Parties
shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be
available, to obtain (without the posting of any bond) specific performance
of the terms of this Agreement. If any Proceeding is brought by the non-
breaching Party or Parties to enforce this Agreement, the Party in breach
shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

Section 12.14 _Survival_. All covenants and agreements contained herein which
by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit
actions, subsequent to the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their terms. All other covenants and agreements contained herein, and all
representations and warranties contained herein or in any certificated
deliveries hereunder, shall not survive the Closing and shall thereupon
terminate.

 

Section 12.15 _Prepetition Claims and Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, and taking into account US Sellers status
as debtors-in-possession in the Bankruptcy Cases and the limitations set forth
in the Bankruptcy Code (including, without limitation, with respect the
payment of prepetition claims (including, without limitation, prepetition
claims on account of Rebates, returns, Chargebacks or coupons)), US Seller
shall not be required to pay or otherwise satisfy any prepetition claims or
liabilities (other than (i) Sellers obligations to pay Cure Costs to
the extent required by this Agreement, (ii) Sellers obligations to pay any
fees due to any regulatory authority in the Ordinary Course of Business in
accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_, except, for the avoidance of doubt,
those related to any Rebates, returns, Chargebacks or coupons, (iii) Sellers
obligations under _Section 7.2(b)(iii)_ to pay any Governmental Authority
with respect to the prosecution and maintenance of applicable material
Registered Business Intellectual Property, and (iv) Sellers obligations to
Buyer under _Sections_

 



52   _3.2_ , _11.2(b)_ and _11.2(c)_ of this Agreement) and none of Sellers
covenants or obligations hereunder shall be construed, directly or indirectly,
to require such payment or satisfaction.

Section 12.16 _Receiver_. For greater certainty, nothing herein or in any bill
of sale or similar document shall constitute an express or implied
representation or warranty by the Receiver or shall create any liability or
obligation for the Receiver.
