set forth in the Closing Date Schedule, between the Closing Deadband Exceptions reflected therein and the Closing Deadband Exceptions
set forth in the Closing Date Schedule or between Closing Indebtedness reflected therein and Closing Indebtedness set forth on

of the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the disputed portions of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Deadband Exceptions and the Closing Indebtedness as originally submitted to the Accountant.
For example, should the disputed portions total in amount to $1,000 and the Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Seller&rsquo;s

Escrow</U></FONT>. On or before 5:00PM (Eastern Time) on November&nbsp;27, 2020, the Seller and the Buyer shall have entered into
the escrow agreement appended hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;F</U> (the &ldquo;<U>Escrow Agreement</U>&rdquo;), with First Republic
Bank (the &ldquo;<U>Escrow Agent</U>&rdquo;), and the Buyer shall have deposited into escrow with the Escrow Agent an amount equal
to fifty-four million dollars&nbsp;($54,000,000) (such amount, together with any interest accrued thereon prior to the Closing
Date, the &ldquo;<U>Deposit</U>&rdquo;) by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
to an account specified therein (the &ldquo;<U>Escrow Account</U>&rdquo;). Subject to the following sentence and <U>Section&nbsp;3.2</U>,
the Deposit shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any
of the Selling Entities or the Buyer. The Deposit shall become payable to the Seller upon the earlier of (a)&nbsp;such time as
it is released in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section&nbsp;3.2<U>(d)</U>, or (b)&nbsp;the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;9.1(c)</U>&nbsp;(a &ldquo;<U>Buyer Default Termination</U>&rdquo;). In such event, Buyer
shall have no further Liability hereunder and shall not be subject to <U>Section&nbsp;10.12</U>. Each of the Parties expressly
acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the Deposit is retained by the Seller pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>,
(x)&nbsp;the Seller&rsquo;s right to receive payment of such amount shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Selling
Entities against the Buyer and each of its Affiliates for all losses and damages in respect of the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby; and (y)&nbsp;none of the Selling Entities shall be entitled to commence or pursue any Action
against any of the Buyer of any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with the Transaction Documents or the failure
to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. Prior to the Closing (including as a result of any Buyer Default Termination
or any other failure by Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby), the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer
and its Affiliates for losses and damages in connection with the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby
shall be limited to the Deposit, and no Selling Entity shall seek or obtain, nor shall it cause or direct any of its Representatives
or any other Person on its or their behalf to seek or obtain, any recovery or award or any losses or damages of any kind (including
damages for the loss of the benefit of the bargain, opportunity cost, loss of premium, time value of money or otherwise, or any
consequential, special, expectancy, indirect or punitive damages), in the aggregate, in excess of the Deposit against the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, collectively, and recovery of the Deposit from the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement will be the Selling Entities&rsquo; sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing to them as a
result of any Buyer Default Termination or any other failure by Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Parties agree that the Seller&rsquo;s right to retain the Deposit, as set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U> is not a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Selling Entities for their respective efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on
the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. At the Closing, the entirety of the Deposit shall remain in the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
until released in accordance with the terms and conditions of <U>Section&nbsp;3.2(d)</U>. In the event the Deposit becomes payable
to the Seller by reason of a Buyer Default Termination, the Escrow Agent shall, within two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after receiving
notice of such Buyer Default Termination from Seller, disburse the Deposit to an account designated by the Seller by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to be retained by the Seller for its own account. If this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein are terminated other than for a termination which constitutes a Buyer Default Termination, the Seller and the Buyer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to, and the Escrow Agent shall, within two (2)&nbsp;Business Days after such instruction, return to
the Buyer the Deposit by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Parties agree to promptly deliver any joint instruction
that the Escrow Agent may require to effectuate the payments contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>. The Escrow Agent&rsquo;s
escrow fees and charges shall be paid by the Buyer.</P>

to eliminate or minimize such withholding. To the extent the Buyer deducts or withholds any amount from Seller that was not required

such amount was improperly deducted or withheld.</P>

after the Closing with respect to any Acquired Subsidiary that is not a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If Buyer desires to make any such Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election with respect to Buyer&rsquo;s acquisition of any Acquired
Subsidiary, Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of its determination to make the Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election
(the &ldquo;<U>Determination Date</U>&rdquo;). If Seller incurs an increased tax liability or cost resulting from a Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any increased tax liability or cost resulting from the inability to claim an otherwise
available capital loss or the elimination of any Seller tax attribute) as compared to such tax liability or costs that the Seller
would have incurred if the Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election was not made, including an increased tax liability resulting from
any payment under this <U>Section&nbsp;7.8(e)</U>&nbsp;(the &ldquo;<U>338 Increased Tax Liability</U>&rdquo;) determined as provided
in this <U>Section&nbsp;7.8(e)</U>, in the event that Buyer actually makes such Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election, then Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for such 338 Increased Tax Liability. Within 90 days following the Determination Date, Seller will deliver
to Buyer a calculation of the 338 Increased Tax Liability, if any, that would result to Seller if Buyer were to make a Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election
with respect to any of the Acquired Subsidiaries that is a non-U.S. corporation along with any information reasonably necessary
for Buyer to review such calculations. Such calculation shall be based on the Allocation. If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on
the impact to Seller, the parties shall submit such calculations to the Accountant for prompt resolution. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and Seller based on the inverse of the percentage that the
Accountant determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted
to the Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accountant awards $600 in favor
of the Seller&rsquo;s position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be borne by
the Seller. Once the Parties agree on the 338 Increased Tax Liability (including through use of the dispute resolution mechanic),
Buyer may elect, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make (or not to make) a Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election with respect
to any of the non-U.S. corporations acquired in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; <U>provided</U> that Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the 338 Increased Tax Liability in the event that Buyer makes a final determination to make any such Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election.
Following the Determination Date, Buyer shall provide (and cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to provide) to Seller such information
and documentation as is reasonably requested by Seller to calculate the 338 Increased Tax Liability. Seller and Buyer will file
all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns and any documents required to effect the Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election,
if any, the Buyer determines to make, in accordance with the Allocation. Seller and Buyer will not take, or cause or permit to
be taken, any action in connection with the filing of any Tax Return on behalf of the Acquired Subsidiaries, Seller, Buyer or
their Affiliates which would be inconsistent with the Section&nbsp;338(g)&nbsp;Election (if made) or the Allocation.</FONT></P>

not be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Subject to <U>Section&nbsp;3.3
</U>and the last sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;10.12</U>, it is accordingly agreed that (a)&nbsp;the Parties shall be entitled
