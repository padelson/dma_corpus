 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 

  

 1.02 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date (as defined in _Section 1.08_), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement has not been terminated or abandoned pursuant to _Article 7_ hereof, the Company and Merger Sub will cause a Certificate of Merger in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.02_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed, in the manner required by the DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the parties shall take such other and further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_." 

  

 1.03 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.04 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth as _Exhibit 1.04(a)_ attached hereto and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable Law. 

   

 1.05 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

  

 1.06 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

  

 1.07 _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Blair Corporation." 

  

 1.08 _Closing_. Subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 200 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, IL 60601, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the third business day following the satisfaction (or waiver if permissible) of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ or (ii) at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Merger Sub may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 1.09 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub, or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its proper officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action. 

  

ARTICLE 2 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB  

  

 2.01 _Effect on Shares of Capital Stock_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) _Common Shares of the Company_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company common stock, no par value per share (" _Common Shares_ "), the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Common Shares referenced in _Section 2.01(b)_) shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $42.50 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of taxes, in the manner provided in _Section 2.03_. All such Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as specified in the preceding sentence. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Certain Common Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Shares, the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is owned by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary as treasury stock or otherwise or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder, the Company or Merger Sub, be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). Each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub capital stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the shares of the Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such shares have been converted pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate representing the shares of Surviving Corporation capital stock into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock formerly represented thereby shall have been converted pursuant to the terms hereof. 

   

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ hereof, but shall represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Common Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.02 _Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each outstanding unexercised option to purchase Common Shares, whether or not then vested or fully exercisable, granted to any current or former employee or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or any other person under any stock option plan or similar plan of the Company or in connection with any employment, consulting or other agreement with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company prior to the date hereof (including, without limitation, the Companys 2000 Omnibus Stock Plan (the " _Stock Plans_ ")). 

   

 (b) As part of the Transactions, the Company shall take all actions necessary so that at the Effective Time, (i) all Options shall be canceled and (ii) all Cash-Pay Options (as defined below) shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full. In consideration of such cancellation, each holder of any Option with an exercise price per Common Share less than the Merger Consideration (each, a " _Cash-Pay Option_ ") will receive from the Company in settlement of such Cash-Pay Option at the Closing a cash payment, subject to any required withholding of taxes, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of any such Cash-Pay Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per Common Share less the applicable exercise price per Common Share otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Cash-Pay Option (the " _Cash-Pay Option Consideration_ "). Each Option that has a exercise price per Common Share equal to or in excess of the Merger Consideration shall be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration. 

   

 (c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written acknowledgement of each holder of a then outstanding Cash-Pay Option that (i) the payment of the Cash-Pay Option Consideration will satisfy in full the Companys obligation to such person pursuant to such Cash-Pay Option and (ii) upon payment of the Cash-Pay Option Consideration, such Cash-Pay Option held by such holder shall, without any action on the part of the Company or the holder, be deemed terminated, canceled, void and of no further force and effect as between the Company and the holder and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations with respect thereto. The form of the written acknowledgment to be provided to the Company to each holder of a Cash-Pay Option is attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.02(c)_. 

   

 (d) As of the Effective Time, each share of restricted Common Shares which was issued pursuant to the Stock Plans prior to the date hereof, whether in book-entry or certificated form, shall become fully vested and shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, plus any "gross-up" for income taxes payable on account of such acceleration of the vesting of such restricted Common Shares as provided in each such holders restricted stock award agreement as in effect as of the date hereof. 

   

 (e) Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to in writing by Merger Sub and the Company or as may be necessary to administer Options or restricted Common Shares issued under the Stock Plans that remain outstanding following the Effective Time, the Stock Plans shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time and no participant in the Stock Plans shall thereafter be granted any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any subsidiary of any of the foregoing. 

   

 (f) The Company covenants that prior to the Effective Time it will take all actions necessary under that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January 12, 1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, to provide that the cancellation and cash-out and conversion of Cash-Pay Options pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act. 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.03 _Payment for Common Shares in the Merger_. 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the " _Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing, immediately prior to the Effective Time, Common Shares for the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) Merger Sub shall deposit, or Merger Sub shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, in trust with the Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ and (y) the Merger Consideration (such aggregate amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of cash to be deposited by Merger Sub pursuant to this Section _2.03(a)_ , Merger Sub shall assume that no holder of Common Shares will perfect their right to appraisal of their Common Shares under the DGCL. 

   

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Agent to mail to each record holder of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Agent, which shall be in a form and contain such other provisions as Parent and the Company may determine necessary, and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof to which such holder is entitled under this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Upon surrender to the Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in the case of Common Shares (other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_), cash (due and payable to such holder, at its election, in check or immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger Consideration. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration is to be delivered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered in the stock transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such delivery to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate, or that such person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.03_, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_) shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate without any interest or dividends thereon. The Payment Fund shall be used as provided herein and shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares formerly represented thereby. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 5.07_ after the Effective Time, upon learning of any such Claim, shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof (although the failure to so notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation from any liability that the Surviving Corporation may have under this  _Section 5.07_, except to the extent such failure actually prejudices the Surviving Corporation).

if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine that

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 5.03_ or elsewhere in the Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear their own Expenses (as defined below) incurred by or on behalf of such party in preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the financing of the Transactions. " _Expenses_ " as used in this Agreement shall include all expenses (including, without limitation, all fees and expenses of outside counsel, investment bankers, banks, other financial institutions, accountants, financial printers, experts and consultants to a party hereto) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the investigation, due diligence examination, authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution, performance and enforcement of this Agreement and the Transactions and the financing thereof and all other matters contemplated by this Agreement and the closing thereof. 

   

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_ or _Section 7.02(d)_ and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ or (iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.04(b)_, then, in any such case (i), (ii) or (iii), (A) if the Company terminates this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period (plus, if the Five Day Period described in the last sentence of _Section 5.09(c)_ is then pending upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, an additional number of business days until the expiration of such Five Day Period), concurrently with any such termination, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub and Parent the Go-Shop Break Up Fee (as defined below) plus their reasonable Expenses and (B) otherwise, concurrently with any such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub and Parent the Break Up Fee (as defined below) plus their actual reasonable Expenses. " _Break Up Fee_ " means cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to 3.5% of the sum of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding as of the date hereof (including the number of shares of unvested restricted Common Shares outstanding as of the date hereof) and (B) the number of Cash-Pay Options issued and outstanding as of the date hereof multiplied by the difference between the Merger Consideration and the weighted average exercise price of the issued and outstanding Cash-Pay Options as of the date hereof. " _Go-Shop Break Up Fee_ " shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of the term "Break Up Fee"; provided that for purposes of the definition of "Go-Shop Break Up Fee" the reference to 3.5% in the definition of Break Up Fee shall be deemed to be "2.0%". 

   

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by any of the parties pursuant to _Section 7.02(e)_ or (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.04(a)_, then, in any such case (i) or (ii), concurrently with any such termination of this Agreement, Parent shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to the Break Up Fee. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.03(a) _or, in the event no Break Up Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ in connection therewith, any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.02(d)_, then, in any such case, concurrently with any such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay all of the actual, reasonable Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "). 

   

 (e) All amounts payable by either party to the other under this _Section 8.01_ shall be paid in cash and in immediately available funds to such account as the recipient may designate in writing to the payor. 

   

 (f) The parties agree that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.01_ are an integral part of the Transactions and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties agrees that payment of the Break Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement pursuant to _Sections 8.01(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_  above, as applicable, if such payments are payable and actually paid, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the parties upon the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances described in _Article 7_. 

   

 8.02 _Survival_. The representations, warranties and agreements made in this Agreement shall not survive beyond the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreements set forth in _Articles 1_ and  _2_ and _Sections 5.04, 5.07, 5.18, 5.19_ and _Article 8_ shall survive the Effective Time and those set forth in _Section 7.05_ shall survive termination. 

  

 8.03 _Modification or Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment that by Law requires the further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. Without limiting the foregoing, this Agreement may not be amended or modified except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the parties. 

  

 8.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party (except that each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign its rights, interests and obligations to any of their respective affiliates or direct or indirect subsidiaries without the consent of the Company, so long as they remain primarily obligated with respect to any such delegated obligation). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 8.05 _Validity_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 8.06 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by overnight courier or telecopier to the respective parties as follows:

 8.10 _Certain Definitions_. As used in this Agreement: 

  

 (a) the term " _affiliate_ ," as applied to any person, shall mean any other person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, that person. For the purposes of this definition, "control" (including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as applied to any person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of that person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; 

   

 (b) the term " _knowledge_ ," of any person which is not an individual means the actual knowledge of such persons directors and executive officers; 

   

 (c) the term " _Person_ " or " _person_ " shall include individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, other entities and groups (which term shall include a "group" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act); and 

   

 (d) the term " _subsidiary_ " or " _subsidiaries_ " means, with respect to any Person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other legal entity of which such Person (either alone or through or together with any other subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the stock or other equity or beneficial interests, the holders of which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing body of such corporation or other legal entity. 

   

 8.11 _Specific Performance_. Except as specifically provided in Article 7 hereof, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, except as specifically provided in Article 7 hereof in the circumstances enumerated therein, it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United

 8.12 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. Any disclosure made with reference to one or more sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed only with respect to such section unless such disclosure is made in such a way as to make its relevance to the information called for by another section of the Company Disclosure Schedule readily apparent in which case, such disclosure shall be deemed to have been included in such other section, notwithstanding the omission of a cross reference thereto. 

  

 8.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso in _Section 8.03_, waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 8.15 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, unless the effects of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.
