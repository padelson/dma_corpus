and without any action on the part of the holder of any Company common stock, no par value per
share (&#147;<U>Common Shares</U>&#148;), the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Common Shares
referenced in <U>Section&nbsp;2.01(b)</U>) shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the
right to receive $42.50 in cash (the &#147;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&#148;), payable to the holder
thereof, without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of taxes, in the
manner provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.03</U>. All such Common Shares, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and each holder of a certificate or
certificates representing any such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as specified in the preceding
sentence.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Cancellation of Certain Common Shares</U>. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Shares, the Company or Merger
Sub, each Common Share that is owned by the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary as treasury
stock or otherwise or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</U>. As of the Effective Time, each share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (&#147;<U>Merger Sub Common Stock</U>&#148;) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder, the Company or Merger Sub, be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (&#147;<U>Surviving Corporation Common Stock</U>&#148;). Each certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub capital stock
shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the
same for exchange, represent the shares of the Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such
shares have been converted pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder
thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate representing the
shares of Surviving Corporation capital stock into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock
formerly represented thereby shall have been converted pursuant to the terms hereof.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Dissenting Shares</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
any Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder (a &#147;<U>Dissenting Shareholder</U>&#148;) who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance
with the DGCL (&#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.01(a)</U> hereof, but
shall represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder&#146;s right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder&#146;s right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive,
upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends
thereon, in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.01(a)</U>. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Common Shares, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of such delivery to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate, or that such person shall establish to the

and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the
failure to be in good standing or to have such governmental approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of Merger Sub and Parent is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term &#147;<U>Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means any effect, circumstance, event or fact that prevents or materially
delays the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to perform in all material respects their obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof.

and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Merger Sub or Parent are necessary to authorize their
execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than the filing
and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Merger Sub and Parent, and (assuming this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company) constitutes the valid and

its respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to creditors&#146; rights generally and to general principles of equity.
