Adjustments with respect to the calculation of the Working Capital Target

(c) If there are any Proposed Adjustments, TDCC shall, no later than thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, notify Purchaser
whether, in each case, TDCC accepts or rejects each such Proposed Adjustment.
Thereafter, TDCC and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that remain with respect to the Proposed Adjustments and to reach
agreement in writing on any Proposed Adjustments not accepted by TDCC. If any
of the Proposed Adjustments are not so resolved (the " _Unresolved
Adjustments_ ," and the aggregate difference between the parties respective
calculations of the Working Capital Target or the Closing Working Capital, as
applicable, resulting from the Unresolved Adjustments, the " _Unresolved
Balance_ ") within sixty (60) days after TDCCs notification to Purchaser of
its rejection of any portion of the Notice of Disagreement (or such longer
period as the parties may mutually agree in writing), then the Unresolved
Adjustments may be submitted for arbitration at the request of either TDCC or
Purchaser to Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ "); _provided_ , that
in the event that Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such
capacity, the parties shall mutually agree in writing to appoint a nationally
recognized firm with accounting expertise and relevant experiences in
resolving similar purchase price adjustment disputes to serve as the
"Accounting Firm" hereunder. The scope of the review by the Accounting Firm
shall be limited to (i) a disposition of the Unresolved Adjustments through a
strict application of the Working Capital Accounting Principles, (ii) based on
its determination of the matters described in _clause (i)_ , a final
calculation of the Working Capital Target and the Closing Working Capital
(including all items and amounts that were previously accepted or agreed upon
or deemed agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this _Section 2.4_),
as applicable, and (iii) an allocation of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm determined in accordance with the formula specified below in
this _Section 2.4(c)_. The Accounting Firm is not to, and the parties shall
not individually request the Accounting Firm to, (A) make any determination
other than as set forth in the previous sentence, (B) determine any Unresolved
Adjustment to be a value higher than the highest value or lower than the
lowest value proposed by the parties in their submissions to the Accounting
Firm; or (C) undertake any independent investigation of the facts relating to
the Unresolved Adjustments. TDCC and

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
render its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly
as practicable and, if at all possible, within thirty (30) days after such
submission of the Unresolved Adjustments. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_
shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and TDCC, on the other hand, as
determined by the Accounting Firm based on the inverse of the percentage that
the Accounting Firms determination (before such allocation) bears to the
total value of each partys respective position in relation to the total
amount of the Unresolved Balance. For purposes of illustration only, if the
Unresolved Balance is one hundred Dollars ($100) and if the final written
determination of the Accounting Firm states that eighty Dollars ($80) of the
Unresolved Balance is resolved in Purchasers favor and twenty Dollars ($20)
of the Unresolved Balance is resolved in TDCCs favor, Purchaser would bear
twenty percent (20%) of the Accounting Firms costs and expenses, on the one
hand, and TDCC would bear eighty percent (80%) of such costs and expenses, on
the other hand. All other fees, expenses and costs incurred by TDCC or
Purchaser in implementing the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ shall be borne
by TDCC or Purchaser, respectively.

 



 

(d) The calculation of the Working Capital Target and the Closing Working
Capital shall become final and binding on all parties upon the earliest of (i)
the date that a Notice of Acceptance is delivered to TDCC pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)(i)_ (in which case the Working Capital Target and the Closing Working
Capital shall be as set forth in the Initial Closing Working Capital Statement
delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_), (ii) the date that immediately
follows the sixty (60) day review period specified in _Section 2.4(b)_, if no
Notice of Disagreement has been delivered by Purchaser to TDCC pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)(ii)_ during such sixty (60) day period (in which case the
Working Capital Target and the Closing Working Capital shall be as set forth
in the Initial Closing Working Capital Statement delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.4(a)_), (iii) the date of an agreement in writing by TDCC and
Purchaser that the Initial Closing Working Capital Statement, together with

the 2017 Measurement Year. The aggregate amount paid with respect to the
Deferred Payment Period (such payment, the " _Deferred Payment_ ") shall be
determined and paid in accordance with this _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(b) Promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days, following the

Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017,
if the Calculated EBITDA is greater than or equal to the Target EBITDA, then
Purchaser shall pay to TDCC an amount equal to the Deferred Payment Amount.

 



 

(c) If the Calculated EBITDA is less than the Target EBITDA, then there shall

(d) _Business EBITDA Statements_.

 



 

(i) Within sixty (60) calendar days following the completion of each
Measurement Year, Purchaser shall deliver to TDCC a statement that sets forth
in reasonable detail its calculation of the Business EBITDA for such
Measurement Year and the elements thereof (each such statement, an " _Initial
Business EBITDA Statement_ "); _provided_ that, if Purchaser has paid the
Deferred Payment Amount to TDCC as of such date, neither Purchaser nor TDCC
shall have any further obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)_. Each
Initial Business EBITDA Statement shall (A) specifically and separately
identify (x) each excluded item from Business EBITDA and (y) each adjustment
to Business EBITDA, and (B) include a schedule reconciling the Business
Combined Income to the audited GAAP financial statements of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries for such fiscal year and (C) include all backup calculations
reasonably necessary to arrive at Purchasers calculation of the Business
EBITDA for such Measurement Year, and shall be certified by the Chief
Financial Officer of Purchaser as having been calculated in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 2.5_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
AgroFresh Entities to, keep true, complete and accurate records in sufficient

its consultants or professional advisors. Furthermore, in order to facilitate
TDCCs review of each Initial Business EBITDA Statement, Purchaser shall, at
its own expense and promptly upon request by TDCC, make available to TDCC and
its auditors copies of the work papers (including the work papers of
Purchasers independent auditors) and back-up materials used by Purchaser in
preparing such initial drafts and such other documents.

 



 

(ii) Upon receipt, TDCC shall review the Initial Business EBITDA Statement for
the 2016 Measurement Year and shall be entitled to, but shall not have an
obligation to, provide questions or comments to, or request information with
respect to, or provide notice of disagreement with, any item contained
therein; _provided_ that TDCCs failure to provide such comments, questions,
notice of disagreement or requests for information with respect to the Initial
Business EBITDA Statement for the 2016 Measurement Year prior to TDCCs
receipt of the Initial Business EBITDA Statement for the 2017 Measurement Year
shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to object under this _Section
2.5(d)(ii)_. Upon receipt, TDCC shall review the Initial Business EBITDA
Statement for the 2017 Measurement Year during the seventy-five (75) day
period commencing on the date that TDCC receives such Initial Business EBITDA
Statement (the " _EBITDA Review Period_ "). If TDCC disagrees with the Initial
Business EBITDA Statement for either of the 2016 Measurement Year or the 2017

 



      
 

 



 

Measurement Year (each, a " _Disputed Business EBITDA Statement_ "), it must,
prior to the end of the EBITDA Review Period, deliver a written notice to
Purchaser (a " _Notice of Business EBITDA Statement Disagreement_ ") setting
out its objections and specifying the adjustments that, in its opinion, should
be made to such Disputed Business EBITDA Statement (collectively, the "
_Proposed Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments_ "). To the extent that there
are any Proposed Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments, Purchaser shall, no
later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Proposed Business EBITDA
Statement Adjustments, notify TDCC which, if any, of the Proposed Business
EBITDA Statement Adjustments it accepts or rejects, and TDCC and Purchaser
shall seek in good faith to resolve any remaining differences in relation to
the Proposed Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments and to reach agreement in
writing on all such Proposed Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments.

 



 

(iii) If TDCC is satisfied with the applicable Initial Business EBITDA
Statement for both the 2016 Measurement Year and the 2017 Measurement Year
(either as originally submitted or after adjustments are agreed upon by
Purchaser and TDCC in accordance with _Section 2.5(d)(ii)_) or if TDCC fails
to deliver a Notice of Business EBITDA Statement Disagreement with respect to
either Initial Business EBITDA Statement before the end of the EBITDA Review
Period, then such Initial Business EBITDA Statement (incorporating, if
applicable, any agreed adjustments) shall be deemed to constitute the "
_Business EBITDA Statement_ " for the 2016 Measurement Year or the 2017
Measurement Year, as applicable, for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) If any of the Proposed Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments are not
resolved or otherwise agreed to (or deemed agreed to) in accordance with
_Sections 2.5(d)(ii)_ and _2.5(d)(iii)_ (such unresolved adjustments the "
_Unresolved Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments_ ") within forty-five (45)
days after Purchasers receipt of a Notice of Business EBITDA Statement
Disagreement, then the Unresolved Business EBITDA Statement Adjustments may be
submitted at the request of TDCC or Purchaser to the Accounting Firm for
arbitration. The scope of the review by the Accounting Firm shall be limited
to (A) a determination of whether the portions of the applicable Initial
Business EBITDA Statement relating to such Unresolved Business EBITDA
Statement Adjustments were prepared in accordance with this _Section 2.5(d)_
and (B) based on its determinations of the matters described in _clause (A)_ ,

Statement that are necessary with respect to the Unresolved Business EBITDA
Statement Adjustments in order to comply with the requirements of this
Agreement. The Accounting Firm is not to make, or be asked to make, any
determination other than as set forth in this _Section 2.5(d)(iv)_. TDCC and
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
render its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly
as practicable after such submission of the Unresolved Business EBITDA
Statement Adjustments. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred
pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(iv)_ and all fees, expenses and costs
incurred by TDCC in implementing the

 



      
 

 



 

provisions of this _Section 2.5_ shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and
one-half by TDCC.

 



 

(v) When, with respect to the Business EBITDA Statement for the 2016
Measurement Year or the 2017 Measurement Year, (A) pursuant to _Section
2.5(d)(ii)_ or _Section 2.5(d)(iii)_, such Initial Business EBITDA Statement
is deemed to constitute the Business EBITDA Statement for the applicable
Measurement Year for purposes of this Agreement, (B) TDCC and Purchaser reach
agreement in writing with respect to such Initial Business EBITDA Statement or
(C) such Initial Business EBITDA Statement is finally determined in accordance
with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.5(d)(iv)_, such Initial Business
EBITDA Statement as so agreed (or deemed agreed) or determined shall be the
"Business EBITDA Statement" for the applicable Measurement Year for purposes
of this Agreement, and the Business EBITDA set forth therein shall be the
"Business EBITDA" for the applicable Measurement Year shall be final and

which would be a reduction of, or deferral to a later period of, more than a
_de minimis_ amount of Business EBITDA;

 



 

(ii) sell, assign, lease or otherwise transfer (directly or indirectly, in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions) all or a portion of

Entities and (B) transactions pursuant to agreements, instruments or
arrangements to which any of the AgroFresh Entities were party on the date of
this Agreement with parties that are not Affiliates of the AgroFresh Entities,

(j) _Tax Treatment of Deferred Payment_. Purchaser and TDCC agree that for
federal, state and local income tax purposes, the Deferred Payment, including
any payment made upon an Event of Default pursuant to _Section 2.5(f)_, shall
be additional consideration for the sale of the AF Interests (and shall be
allocated among the AgroFresh Assets in accordance with the Tax Receivables
Agreement and applicable Law) and Purchaser shall cause such payments to be

taxable period (including any Straddle Period) that is related or attributable
to (A) "subpart F income" (within the meaning of Section 952 of the Code or
similar provision of state or local Law) or (B) the holding of "United States
property" (within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code or similar provision

Agreement, there are no Proceedings pending or, to TDCCs Knowledge,
threatened, against AgroFresh or any Seller (solely in relation to the
Business) before any Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected
to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.16(a)_ , the operation of the Business is not subject to any order,
judgment, decree, injunction, stipulation or consent order of or with any
Governmental Authority, the failure to comply with which would be reasonably
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect, other than any such
orders having application to industry-wide matters.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Proceedings pending or, to
TDCCs Knowledge, threatened, by or against AgroFresh or any Seller with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

3.17 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17_ ,
AgroFresh and the Asset Transferors (solely in relation to the Business) are
in compliance with all Laws applicable to or binding on them or any of the
Business Assets, except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be
expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2015,
none of AgroFresh or any Seller has received any written notice from a
Governmental Authority alleging that AgroFresh or any Seller (solely in
relation to the Business) is not in compliance with any applicable Law, except
where such failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect. This _Section 3.17_ does not address
matters that are specifically covered by other representations and warranties
contained in this _Article III_.

supplied by TDCC for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the
time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the stockholders of Purchaser, (ii) the time of the Purchaser
Stockholders Meeting or (iii) the Closing, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that TDCC makes no representation with respect to any forward-
looking statements supplied by TDCC for inclusion in, or relating to
information to be included in, the Proxy Statement.

 



 

3.19 _Securities Law Matters_. TDCC (or its applicable Affiliate) is acquiring
Purchaser Common Stock solely for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation
of the Securities Act, any applicable state securities Law or any applicable
foreign securities Law. TDCC acknowledges that the Purchaser Common Stock is
not registered under the Securities Act, any applicable state securities Law
or any applicable foreign securities Law and that such Purchaser Common Stock
may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to the registration provisions
of the Securities Act or applicable foreign securities Law or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to state or foreign securities
Laws, as applicable. TDCC (or its applicable Affiliate) has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Purchaser Common
Stock and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such investment. Each of
TDCC and its applicable Affiliates is

 



       
 

 



 

an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act.

 



 

3.20 _Independent Investigation_. In making the decision to enter into this
Agreement and the Related Agreements and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than reliance on the representations
and warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, TDCC has relied
solely on its own independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of
Purchaser and its business. TDCC confirms to Purchaser that TDCC is
sophisticated and knowledgeable about the Purchaser and its business and is
capable of evaluating the matters set forth above.

the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and has all requisite
corporate or other business entity power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and to conduct its business as currently conducted, except
where the failure to be in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not materially impair Purchasers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Copies of the Purchaser Organizational Documents that are

securities Laws and are not subject to, and were not issued in violation of,
any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,

AgroFresh Business Combination), there are not any outstanding Contracts of
Purchaser to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Interest in

accordance with the terms hereof, shall be duly authorized and validly issued,

(d) Purchaser has no Subsidiaries and does not own, directly or indirectly,
any Equity Interests or other interests or investments (whether equity or
debt) in any Person, whether incorporated or unincorporated. Purchaser is not

to or make any capital contribution to any other Person.

 



 

4.3 _Authorization_. Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and its Related Agreements (in
each case to the extent it is a party thereto) and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by Purchaser and each of its applicable Affiliates of this
Agreement and its Related Agreements (in each case to the extent it is a party

Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or other business entity action.
Purchaser has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, at
or prior to the Closing, Purchaser and each of its applicable Affiliates will

Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Related Agreements by the other parties hereto and thereto, this Agreement
constitutes, and each Related Agreement shall after the Closing constitute,
legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and the Affiliates of
Purchaser party thereto, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations.

 



 

4.4 _Governmental Consents; No Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements by Purchaser do not and will not require any Consent of or with any
Governmental Authority, other than any Consent the failure of which to be
obtained would not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation by Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and of the

constitute any of the foregoing under, any Contract to which Purchaser or any
such Affiliate is a party or by which Purchaser or any such Affiliate or their
respective assets are bound or (iii) violate or conflict with any provision of
the Purchaser Organizational Documents or similar organizational documents of
any such Affiliate, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), where
such violation, conflict, breach, cancellation, termination, default or Lien

Adverse Effect or would not prevent or materially delay the consummation by
Parent or any such Affiliate of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or furnished
by Purchaser with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since
Purchasers incorporation to the date of this Agreement, together with any
amendments, restatements or supplements thereto (all of the foregoing filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, the " _Purchaser SEC Reports_ "), and
will have filed all such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date (the " _Additional Purchaser SEC Reports_ "). All
Purchaser SEC Reports, Additional Purchaser SEC Reports, any correspondence
from or to the SEC or NASDAQ (other than such correspondence in connection
with the initial public offering of Purchaser) and all certifications and
statements required by (i) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) 18 U.S.C. § 1350 (Section 906) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to
any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Certifications_ ") are available on
EDGAR in full without redaction. Purchaser has heretofore furnished to TDCC
true and complete copies of all amendments and modifications that have not
been filed by the Purchaser with the SEC to all agreements, documents and
other instruments that previously had been filed by the Purchaser with the SEC
and are currently in effect. The Purchaser SEC Reports were, and the
Additional Purchaser SEC Reports will be, prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
Purchaser SEC Reports did not, and the Additional Purchaser SEC Reports will
not, at the time they were or are filed, as the case may be, with the SEC
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Certifications are each true and correct.
Purchaser maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Each director and executive
officer of Purchaser has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements
required with respect to Purchaser by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. As used in this _Section 4.5_, the term
"file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or
information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the Purchaser SEC Reports fairly present, and the financial statements and
notes to be contained in or to be incorporated by reference in the Additional
Purchaser SEC Reports will fairly present, the financial condition and the
results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of
Purchaser as at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in
such financial statements, all in accordance with (i) GAAP and (ii) Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in the case of interim
financial statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of
which will not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the
omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K,
as applicable. No financial statements other than those of Purchaser are
required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of
Purchaser.

 



 

4.6 _Trust Account_. Purchaser has (and will have immediately prior to the
Closing) at least two hundred twenty million five hundred two thousand nine
hundred sixty-one Dollars ($220,502,961) in the account established by
Purchaser for the benefit of its public stockholders at the Trustee (the "
_Trust Account_ "), such monies invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act and held in trust by Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of February 12, 2014, between
Purchaser and Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is
valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its
terms and has not been amended or modified. There are no separate Contracts,
side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of the Trust
Agreement in the Purchaser SEC Reports to be inaccurate or that would entitle
any Person (other than stockholders of Purchaser holding Purchaser Issued
Equity sold in Purchasers initial public offering who shall have elected to
redeem their Purchaser Issued Equity pursuant to the Purchaser Charter) to any
portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account may be released. There are no Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened with respect to the
Trust Account.

 



 

4.7 _Investment Company Act; JOBS Act_. Purchaser is not an "investment
company" or a Person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or acting on
behalf of an "investment company", in each case within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act. Purchaser constitutes an "emerging growth company"
within the meaning of the JOBS Act.

 



 

4.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of Purchasers
incorporation, (a) there has not been any change, effect, event or occurrence
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect and (b) Purchaser has conducted its business only in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Since January 1,
2015, there has not been any circumstance, action or activity that, if such
circumstance, action or activity had occurred or been taken after the date
hereof, would be a violation of _Section 5.2(a)_ or _5.2(c)_ by Purchaser.

 



 

4.9 _Title to Assets_. Subject to the restrictions on use of the Trust Account
set forth in the Trust Agreement, Purchaser owns good and marketable title to,
or holds a valid leasehold

 



      
 

 



 

interest in, or a valid license to use, all of the assets used by Purchaser in
the operation of its business and which are material to Purchaser, free and
clear of any Liens.

Affiliates any information or materials that would constitute "confidential
information" or "evaluation material" (or similar term defined in a Contract

TDCC or any of its Affiliates pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, non-
disclosure agreement or any other Contract containing confidentiality or non-
disclosure obligations (such information or materials, " _Third Party
Confidential Information_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

4.20 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser has delivered to TDCC true and complete copies of (i) an
executed commitment letter, dated as of April 30, 2015, respectively
(including all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets and the executed
fee letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ")) attached thereto or contemplated thereby
(collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Committed Lenders have
committed to provide debt financing contemplated thereby (the " _Debt
Financing_ ") for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) The aggregate net cash proceeds to Purchaser of the Financing (after
giving effect to any related fees or expenses) will provide sufficient funds
to Purchaser to pay (i) all amounts required to be paid in respect of the Cash
Consideration and any other amounts due and payable by Purchaser under this
Agreement at Closing, in each case, (A) without any increase in the
indebtedness or other obligations of the Company or (B) use of the assets of
the Company (other than the Trust Account) and (ii) any and all fees and
expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with the AgroFresh
Business Combination and the Financing. The obligations of the Committed
Lenders to fund the entire amount of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters are not subject to any condition or contingency, including
any subsequent approval process, other than the conditions explicitly set
forth in Section 6 entitled "Conditions Precedent" of the Debt Commitment
Letters (such conditions, as so explicitly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters as of the date hereof or as amended in accordance with the provisions
hereof, the " _Debt Financing Conditions_ "). There are no side letters or
other Contracts related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
Financing except for the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter. Assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other Person party thereto
(which, to the knowledge of Purchaser, is the case), each of the Debt
Commitment Letters (and the commitments of the Committed Lenders to provide
the Debt Financing set forth therein) is in full force and effect, has not
been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any manner, has been duly
executed by Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, each other Person
party thereto, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, each other Person party thereto,
enforceable against Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, each other
Person party thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations. Purchaser has fully paid, or caused to be fully
paid, any and all commitment, arrangement, upfront or other fees or amounts
that are due and payable in connection with the Financing, and no further
commitment or other fees will be required to be paid by Purchaser in respect
of the Financing at any time prior to the Closing. No event has occurred that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach,
default or failure of a condition by Purchaser or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, any other parties to the Commitment Letter, in each case, under the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this
Agreement, Purchaser, after conducting due inquiry, has no reason to believe
that any of the Debt Financing Conditions will not be satisfied on a timely
basis or that the Financing will not be available to Purchaser on the Closing
Date.

 



 

4.21 _Securities Law Matters_. Purchaser is acquiring the AF Interests and the
AgroFresh Entity Securities solely for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act, any applicable

 



      
 

 



 

state securities Law or any applicable foreign securities Laws. Purchaser
acknowledges that the AF Interests and AgroFresh Entity Securities are not
registered under the Securities Act, any applicable state securities Law or
any applicable foreign securities Laws and that such AF Interests and
AgroFresh Entity Securities may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to
the registration provisions of the Securities Act or applicable foreign
securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant
to state or foreign securities Laws, as applicable. Purchaser has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the AF Interests and
the AgroFresh Entity Securities and is capable of bearing the economic risks
of such investment. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

 



 

4.22 _Solvency_. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, any Alternative Financing and the payment
of the Cash Consideration, payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and payment of all related fees and expenses, Purchaser will be
Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after the consummation of the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of the foregoing, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the
definition of "Solvent", "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will
be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or
refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become
due. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Purchaser or its subsidiaries.

 



 

4.23 _Independent Investigation_. In making the decision to enter into this
Agreement, and the Related Agreements and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than reliance on the representations
and warranties of TDCC set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser has relied
solely on its own independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the
Business, AgroFresh and the Business Assets (including Purchasers own
estimate and appraisal of the value of the Business, financial condition,
operations and prospects of the Business, AF Interests , AgroFresh Entities
and Business Assets). Purchaser confirms to TDCC that Purchaser is
sophisticated and knowledgeable about the Business and is capable of
evaluating the matters set forth above.

every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible,

this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, enter into
any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any

(i) Purchaser shall comply with all Laws relating to the manufacture,
packaging, labeling, shipping, transportation, importation, exportation,
storage, handling and sale of the Products;

(e) Purchaser agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall acquire
any rights whatsoever in the Dow Names by virtue of their use of the Dow Names
during this transition period, and that all use of the Dow Names during this
transition period shall inure solely to the benefit of TDCC and its
Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, ensure that

the benefit of TDCC and its Affiliates. In no event shall Purchaser or its

other manner detrimental to TDCC or its Affiliates.

 



 

(f) Purchaser agrees that TDCC and its Affiliates shall have no responsibility
for claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the use by
Purchaser and its Affiliates of any Dow Names after the Closing. In addition
to any and all other available remedies, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless TDCC and its Affiliates, successors and assigns, from and against any
such claims that may arise out of the use of the Dow Names by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (i) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
_Section 5.4_, other than such claims that the Dow Names infringe the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party; or (ii) in violation of or
outside the scope permitted by this _Section 5.4_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser hereby acknowledges that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of this _Section 5.4_, the TDCC, in

Affiliates for and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from, any and
all Liability for any brokers or finders fees or other commissions arising

commissions arising with respect to brokers or finders retained or engaged by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (or claiming to have been retained or
engaged thereby) in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

5.6 _Preservation of Books and Records; Access and Assistance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
preserve and retain all Business Records and other accounting, legal, auditing
and other books and records of the Business (including any documents relating
to any governmental or non-governmental claims, Proceedings or investigations
with respect to the AgroFresh Entities or TDCC or its Affiliates) relating to
(i) the conduct of the Business or (ii) the ownership or operation of the
Business Assets or the AgroFresh Entities prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Retained Records_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser may dispose of any such books and records during such seven (7) year
period if such books and records are first offered in writing to TDCC and not
accepted by TDCC within thirty (30) days of such offer. If at any time after
the end of the applicable retention period Purchaser intends to dispose of any
such books and records, Purchaser shall not do so without first offering such
books and records to TDCC.

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall permit TDCC and its authorized
Representatives to have reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy, all
Retained Records and to meet with officers and employees of Purchaser on a
mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations with respect to such
Retained Records, to obtain additional information and for any other
reasonable business purpose, including the preparation of financial
statements.

 



 

(c) In the event and for so long as either party hereto is contesting or
defending against any Proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim or demand in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction prior
to the Closing Date involving any Business Asset, AgroFresh Entities or the
Business, the other party hereto shall (A) fully cooperate with the contesting
or defending party and its counsel in, and assist the contesting or defending
party and its counsel with, the contest or defense, (B) make available such
other partys personnel (including for purposes of fact finding, consultation,
interviews, depositions and, if required, as witnesses) and (C) provide such
information, testimony and access to its books and records, in each case as
shall be reasonably requested in connection with the contest or defense, all
at the sole cost and expense (not including employee compensation and benefits
costs) of the contesting or defending party. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 5.6(c)_ shall not apply with respect to disputes between the parties
hereto.

 



 

5.7 _Removal of Certain Assets_. Except as permitted under the terms and
conditions of the Occupancy Agreement or the Bailment Agreement with respect
to the Business Assets located at the facilities of TDCC or its Affiliates
subject thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in
any event within thirty (30) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall, at its
sole cost and expense, remove all of the Business Assets from any facility or
warehouse of TDCC or its Affiliates. In the event that any Business Asset has
not been removed as of the date that is thirty (30) days after the Closing,
TDCC shall have the right to use or

 



      
 

 



 

dispose of such Business Asset in its sole discretion. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing, but in any event within thirty (30) days after
the Closing, TDCC shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove the assets set
forth on _Schedule 5.7_ from any real property that is subject to the Real
Property Leases included in the Business Assets.

 



 

5.8 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges that (a) all of the insurance policies
and programs maintained by TDCC or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing
Date will be terminated with respect to the Business and the AgroFresh
Entities effective as of the Closing Date and (b) upon such termination, the
Business (including the AgroFresh Entities) will cease to be covered under
such policies and programs and Purchaser will have to obtain replacement
coverage (including coverage as Purchaser deems appropriate for the Business
Assets, AgroFresh Entities and the operation of the Business). For the
avoidance of doubt, TDCC shall retain all rights to control its and its
Affiliates insurance policies and programs, including the right to exhaust,
settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect
to any of its insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding whether any
such policies or programs apply to any Liability of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

5.9 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, (i) the obligations of
confidentiality and limited use contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall, without further action of any party, terminate with respect to
information relating solely to (x) the Business (but excluding information
relating to matters that are not Business Assets) or (y) the Business Assets
of AgroFresh; and (ii) the restrictions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement regarding contacting client, customers and suppliers and other
parties having a relationship to the Business shall, without further action of
any party, terminate. Purchaser acknowledges that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in all other respects in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that certain Transferred Employees may have
obtained confidential information associated with Other Dow Businesses
(collectively, " _Confidential Information_ "), and that these employees have
previously signed confidentiality agreements that contain covenants
prohibiting the use or disclosure of such Confidential Information. Purchaser
agrees to respect and not interfere with the terms and conditions of such
confidentiality agreements, including by not seeking or requiring the
disclosure of any Confidential Information by such employees in breach of such
confidentiality agreements.

 



 

5.10 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) TDCC shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law), all Tax Returns of the AgroFresh Entities and with respect to
the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that relate to Consolidated Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, in accordance with past practice (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law), all other Tax Returns of the AgroFresh Entities and with
respect to the Business.

 



 

(c) Any refunds (or credits for overpayment), rebates or similar payments of
Taxes, including any interest received from a Tax authority thereon, of the
AgroFresh Entities and with respect to the Business attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of TDCC. Promptly upon receipt by
Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) of any such refund (or credit for
overpayment), Purchaser shall pay over, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, any such refund (or the amount of any such credit), including
any interest thereon, to TDCC. At TDCCs request, Purchaser shall take, or
cause its Affiliate to take, any reasonable action necessary to promptly claim
refunds attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Following written notice
from Purchaser, TDCC will reasonably promptly reimburse Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, any such refund to the extent
subsequently disallowed by a relevant Tax authority.

 



 

(d)

 



 

(i) (A) Purchaser and each of the AgroFresh Entities agree to give written
notice to TDCC of the receipt of any written notice by Purchaser or any of the
AgroFresh Entities that involves the assertion of any claim for Taxes or the
commencement of any Tax Proceeding or Tax audit for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
and (B) TDCC agrees to give written notice to Purchaser of the receipt of any
written notice by TDCC which involves the assertion of any claim for Taxes
with respect to the AgroFresh Entities or the Business.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, TDCC shall control the
contest or resolution of any Tax Proceeding with respect to Consolidated
Taxes.

 



 

(e) After the Closing, TDCC and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns to the extent such filing requires one
party (or its Affiliates) to provide to the other party (or its Affiliates)
necessary information, records and documents relating to (i) the AgroFresh
Entities or (ii) the Business. TDCC and Purchaser shall cooperate in the same
manner in defending or resolving any audit, examination or litigation relating
to Taxes.

 



 

(f) After the Closing, AgroFresh will be responsible for all sales, use,
transfer, real property transfer, value added, recording, registration, stamp,
stamp duty or similar Taxes and fees and all formalities and recording costs,
arising out of the transfer of the AF Interests and the Business Assets
pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to any Restructuring
Transaction) and all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "). The Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be
timely prepared by the party legally obligated to make such filing. The
parties agree to cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation
and filing of such Tax Returns, in obtaining all available exemptions from
such Transfer Taxes and in timely providing each other with resale
certificates and any other documents necessary to satisfy any such exemptions.
At the Closing, TDCC shall

 



       
 

 



 

deliver to Purchaser a schedule setting forth TDCCs good faith estimate of
all Transfer Taxes by jurisdiction, which schedule shall be updated by TDCC
following determination of the Allocation Schedule (as defined in the Tax
Receivables Agreement).

 



 

(g) Wherever possible, the parties agree to subject any transfer of assets
pursuant to any Restructuring Transaction to the value added tax exemption
provisions which are set forth in paragraphs 19 and 29 of the European
Directive No. 2006/112/EC dated November 28, 2006, as amended, or to
equivalent provisions under applicable Law, and to cooperate in obtaining any
such exemptions. Any value added tax or other Transfer Taxes, if any,
applicable to the transfer of assets to the AgroFresh Entities pursuant to the
Restructuring Transactions or otherwise, that are required to be paid or
collected and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority by TDCC or any
Affiliate thereof, shall be paid by Purchaser to TDCC, as an addition to the
Purchase Price, on or before March 31, 2016 (the " _Transfer Tax Payment Date_
"); _provided_ that to the extent any AgroFresh Entity receives a refund or
recovery with respect to such Transfer Taxes prior to the Transfer Tax Payment
Date, Purchaser shall make payment to TDCC of such refund or recovery within
five (5) Business Days after receipt thereof (and the amount to be paid by
Purchaser to TDCC on the Transfer Tax Payment Date shall be reduced by the
amount of such prior payment).

 



 

(h) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not amend any previously filed Tax
Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, file Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period in a jurisdiction where AgroFresh has not historically filed Tax
Returns, initiate discussions or examinations with any Tax authority regarding
Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, make any voluntary
disclosures with respect to Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case,
without the prior written Consent of TDCC or as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(i) Purchaser and RandH shall make a timely joint election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code, and any similar election as may be available under
applicable state or local law (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_"), with respect to the AgroFresh Business Combination. Purchaser and
RandH agree to timely execute any and all forms (including IRS Form 8023 and
all such forms, schedules and attachments as are necessary or required to be
filed therewith pursuant to the applicable Treasury Regulations (and any
similar election as may be available under applicable state or local law)) as
are required in order to make a valid Section 338(h)(10) Election and
Purchaser and RandH shall each take such other actions as are necessary to
make or perfect the Section 338(h)(10) Election. For purposes of executing and

5.11 _Restructuring Transactions; Transition Efforts_.

 



 

(a) TDCC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the transactions
contemplated by _Exhibit K_ (the " _Restructuring Transactions_ ") to be
consummated at or before the Closing, _provided_ that to the extent any
Restructuring Transaction is not consummated at or before the Closing, subject
to _Section 2.4_ and _Section 5.3(h)_, TDCC shall cause such Restructuring
Transaction to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Closing. TDCC shall be entitled upon written notice to Purchaser to amend
_Exhibit K_ so long as such amendment does not adversely impact the operation
of the Business after the Closing in any material respect. At TDCCs request
from time to time, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly provide to TDCC, AgroFresh or either of their respective Affiliates
all reasonably requested information that TDCC, AgroFresh or either of their
respective Affiliates may require from Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the Restructuring Transactions.

 



 

(b) During the period before the Closing, each of TDCC and Purchaser shall
reasonably cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all necessary and appropriate actions to enable
AgroFresh and its Subsidiaries to conduct the Business from and after the
Closing without support from TDCC (other than the services provided pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement and the India Transition Services
Agreement and rights of the AgroFresh Entities under the Bailment Agreement,
Occupancy Agreement and Seconding Agreement). In furtherance and not in
limitation of such obligations, each party agrees to enter into, or to cause
its applicable Affiliate to enter into, the Sublease Agreement at the Closing.
The parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section 5.11(b)_ is not intended
to impose any obligation on the parties from and after the Closing and shall
not modify or otherwise impact in any respect the rights and obligations of
the parties under the Transition Services Agreement and the India Transition
Services Agreement.

 



 

(c) If there shall have occurred any fact or circumstance that constitutes a
breach of or inaccuracy in _Section 3.7(a)_ (such fact or circumstance, a "
_Deficiency_ "), at any time and from time to time from and after the Closing
Date until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser may
deliver to TDCC written notice setting forth (i) a reasonably detailed
description of such Deficiency, (ii) the impact of such Deficiency on the
operations of the Business and (iii) if available, the cost of the impact of
such Deficiency. Upon receipt of such notice of a Deficiency, TDCC shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, take (at the sole cost and expense of TDCC) all
actions necessary or appropriate to remediate the Deficiency and enable
Purchaser to operate the Business in all material respects in the manner in
which the Business would operate absent such Deficiency, including delivery of
such asset or services constituting such Deficiency or a reasonable
replacement thereto that remediates such Deficiency in the manner contemplated
by this _Section 5.11(c)_. The parties agree that this _Section 5.11(c)_ is
not intended to remediate immaterial impacts to the operation of the Business
that may be addressed through de minimis efforts of Purchaser. If there shall
have occurred any fact or circumstance that constitutes a breach of or
inaccuracy in _Section 3.7(b)_ (such fact or circumstance, a " _Non-Business
Liability_ "), at any time and from time to time from and after the Closing
Date until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser may
deliver to TDCC written notice setting forth (i) a reasonably detailed
description of such Non-Business Liability, (ii) the impact of such Non-
Business Liability on the operations of the Business and (iii) if available,
the cost of the impact of such Non-Business Liability. Upon receipt of such

 



      
 

 



 

notice of a Non-Business Liability, TDCC shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, take (at the sole cost and expense of TDCC) all actions necessary or
appropriate to assume and agree to pay and discharge when due such Non-
Business Liability. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with TDCC in
connection with the performance by TDCC of its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.11(c)_.

 



 

5.12 _Local Transfer Agreements_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, TDCC shall cause the Local Transfer Agreements to be prepared
and executed by the applicable parties ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Local Transfer Agreements that do not need to be executed and delivered until
Closing in order to give effect to the transactions contemplated thereby as of
Closing shall not be executed and delivered in advance). TDCC and Purchaser
agree that such Local Transfer Agreements shall not expand or limit the rights
and Liabilities of AgroFresh or TDCC or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates, on the other hand, beyond those
provided for in this Agreement, and that the Local Transfer Agreements shall
not provide for any additional rights or Liabilities of TDCC or Purchaser or
their respective Affiliates that are not provided for in this Agreement or
necessary to comply with applicable Law of any applicable foreign
jurisdiction. The Local Transfer Agreements shall be prepared in accordance
with this Agreement with only such modifications as may be necessary to comply
with applicable Law of any applicable foreign jurisdiction. In the event of
any conflict between the terms of any Local Transfer Agreement and this
Agreement, TDCC and Purchaser agree and acknowledge that the terms of this
Agreement shall control and that, if necessary, TDCC and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, deliver such additional
instruments as may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing. Before execution
of any Local Transfer Agreement, TDCC shall provide Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Local Transfer Agreement.

 



 

5.13 _Intercompany Accounts and Arrangements_. Prior to the Closing, TDCC
shall take (or cause one or more of its Affiliates or AgroFresh to take) such
actions required to settle, effective as of, or prior to, the Closing Date all
intercompany accounts so that there are no intercompany obligations, interest,
fees, payables or receivables between AgroFresh, on the one hand, and TDCC or
any of its Affiliates, on the other hand (in each case other than as may be
contemplated in connection with the Restructuring Transactions). In the event
TDCC is unable to settle all such intercompany accounts prior to the Closing,
the parties shall, upon request of TDCC, cooperate in good faith from and
after the Closing to equitably settle such accounts. TDCC shall be entitled to
terminate (and cause its Affiliates to terminate), effective upon the Closing,
any intercompany Contracts (or portions thereof), services, support and other
arrangements, whether written or oral (except for the Related Agreements or
the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.13_ ), between AgroFresh, on the one
hand, and TDCC or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, and from and after
the Closing, no further rights or Liabilities of any party shall continue
under such terminated Contracts (or portions thereof) or arrangements (in each
case other than as may be contemplated in connection with the Restructuring
Transactions). TDCC shall be entitled to terminate (and cause its Affiliates
to terminate), effective upon the Closing, the participation of AgroFresh in,
or contractual privity of AgroFresh to, any Group Contract and from and after
the Closing, no further rights or Liabilities of AgroFresh shall continue
under such Group Contract. Purchaser acknowledges that, from and after the
Closing, AgroFresh will no longer be able to participate with TDCC and its
Affiliates in Group Contracts

 



      
 

 



 

or any group and volume purchasing arrangements that AgroFresh may have
participated in prior to the Closing.

 



 

5.14 _Transfer of Registrations_.

 



 

(a) _Transfer of Registrations_. As promptly as reasonably practical after the
date hereof, TDCC and Purchaser shall cause the documents required to effect
the transfer of the Transferred Registrations in each applicable jurisdiction
to be prepared and, prior to the Closing, executed (if required) by the
applicable Persons. As promptly as reasonably practical after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, on behalf of the Asset Transferors (if applicable),
submit to the relevant Governmental Authorities those documents required to
transfer the Transferred Registrations to Purchaser or its designated
Affiliate and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
Consents with respect to the Transferred Registrations as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Purchaser shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses associated with transferring the Transferred Registrations and all
fees and expenses associated with the Transferred Registrations that become
due and payable following the Closing, including any out-of-pocket expenses of
TDCC or any of its Affiliates. The parties understand and agree that TDCCs
efforts under this _Section 5.14_ do not require TDCC or any of its
Affiliates to offer or grant financial accommodations or deliver anything of
value to any Person or to remain secondarily liable with respect to the
Business.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Transferred Registration Data_. TDCC shall deliver hard
copies of the Transferred Registration Data (or in such other method or form

enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter
(collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and related Fee Letter (or on such other terms acceptable to Purchaser
and the Committed Lenders so long as such other terms or conditions (x) do not
contain any conditions precedent to the consummation of the Debt Financing

not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to timely consummate the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Financing or the Closing), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis all of the Debt
Financing Conditions and any other conditions to funding of the Debt Financing

(ii) Without the prior written consent of TDCC, Purchaser shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, or replace, any Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Agreement if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement would
reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent the Closing Date, (B) modify
the Debt Financing Conditions or create any new condition to the Debt
Financing (other than the Debt Financing Conditions) if such modification or
creation would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing Date or
make the funding of the entire amount of the Debt Financing (or the

occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against other parties to any Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing
Agreement prior to the Closing. Without the prior written consent of TDCC,
Purchaser shall not permit any assignment of rights or obligations under any

Commitment Letter (taking into account flex provisions). Purchaser shall
promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of any Alternative
Financing commitment (together with a copy of any related fee letter with only
the fee amount redacted) to TDCC, and, to the extent applicable, thereafter

reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by such commitment letters (including fee letters) for
the Alternative Financing, (y) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" or the "Committed Lenders" shall be deemed to be the
commitment letters (including fee letters) for the Alternative Financing and
the lenders or other providers of such Alternative Financing, respectively,
and (z) any reference in this Agreement to the Debt Financing Conditions shall
include the conditions to the Alternative Financing set forth in the
commitment letters (including fee letters) for the Alternative Financing

arranging and obtaining the Debt Financing as contemplated by the Debt
Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _clause (i)_

Affiliates, (B) pay any commitment or similar fee in connection with such
financing, (C) enter into any agreement, document or instrument in connection

would result in a violation of any confidentiality arrangement or material
agreement or the loss of any attorney-client or other similar privilege, (F)
make any representation or warranty in connection with such debt financing or
the marketing or arrangement thereof, (G) prepare or deliver any financial
statements or other financial information other than any such financial
statements or other financial information to the extent required to be
delivered by TDCC under _Section 5.17(e)_, (H) provide any cooperation, or
take any action, that would cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be breached or any condition to Closing set forth in this
Agreement to fail to be satisfied, or (I) provide any cooperation, or take any
action, following the Closing. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_, as it applies to TDCCs
obligations under this _clause (i)_ shall be deemed satisfied unless TDCC
knowingly and intentionally materially breaches its obligations under this
_clause (i)_.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the TDCC Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of

information utilized in connection therewith or otherwise arising from the
Debt Financing. Purchaser shall from time to time, promptly upon request by
TDCC, reimburse TDCC and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives or agents for any and all reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses (including reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of counsel, accountants and other advisors) incurred by any
of them in connection with any of their cooperation or assistance with respect
to the Debt Financing or the provision of any information utilized in
connection therewith or otherwise arising from the Debt Financing. Purchaser
hereby covenants and agrees that all rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, "bank books", offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda, offering documents, lender presentations or any other marketing or
similar documents prepared in connection with the Debt Financing shall contain
disclosures and disclaimers exculpating TDCC and its Affiliates with respect
to any liability related to the contents or use thereof by the recipients
thereof.

constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Business Combination
Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement regarding, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way that would
otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to, any Business Combination or (iii)
commence, continue or renew any due diligence investigation regarding any
Business Combination. Purchaser shall and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Business Combination Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.22_ by any of Purchaser or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.22_ by
Purchaser.

 



 

5.23 _Purchaser Affiliate Agreements_. At or before the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Purchaser Affiliate Agreements to be amended, terminated or
otherwise modified in accordance with _Schedule 5.23_ and, if terminated, to

the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and notice thereof to the Trustee

the terms of the Trust Agreement), (a) in accordance with and pursuant to the
Trust Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) cause the documents,
opinions and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the

payable to stockholders of Purchaser holding shares of Purchaser Common Stock
sold in Purchasers initial public offering who shall have previously validly
elected to redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to the
Purchaser Charter (and, in accordance with the mechanics for such redemption
set forth in the Proxy Statement), and (B) immediately thereafter all
remaining amounts then available in the Trust Account in accordance with this
Agreement and (b) thereafter, the Trust Account shall terminate.

 



 

5.25 _Specified Retained Matter_. Each of TDCC and Purchaser agrees to (a)

agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to restructure payment of its
Transaction Expenses (other than commitment, arrangement, upfront and other
fees or amounts that are due and payable by Purchaser in connection with the
Debt Financing) such that, to the maximum extent possible, such Transaction
Expenses will be paid after the Closing or in non-cash consideration,
_provided_ that TDCC shall have the right to approve any such restructuring of
Transaction Expenses. Any reduction in the cash amount of Transaction Expenses
of Purchaser payable at Closing that is effectuated through performance of
Purchasers obligations under this _Section 5.26_ shall be deemed to reduce

Equity Interests shall have no right to vote on any matter on which holders of
Purchaser Common Stock are entitled to vote under the Purchaser Charter; and
(b) mutually agree on the selection of an independent certified public
accountant to serve as the auditor of Purchaser in accordance with Section
12(c)(i) of the Investor Rights Agreement.

Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; (iii) include a summary of
benefits to be provided to such US Employee, which benefits, during the first
twenty-four (24) months following the Closing, shall be substantially
comparable in value, when taken as a whole, to those to which such US Employee
was entitled prior to the Closing; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not have
any obligation to provide such U.S. Employees with any defined benefit pension
plan or similar defined benefit arrangement (it being understood that the
value of any such defined benefit pension or similar arrangement provided by
TDCC and its Affiliates shall be taken into account for purposes of
determining comparable value); and (iv) not require a Geographic Relocation of
the US Employee. Each such individual who accepts Purchasers offer of
employment shall become an employee of Purchaser (or its designated Affiliate)

Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.1(b)_ to the
contrary, for purposes of satisfying the comparability requirements of this
_Section 6.1(b_ _),_ such comparability may be made on an aggregate basis for
the Transferred US Employees as a whole and not individually for each
Transferred US Employee.

 



 

(c) Except for earned or accrued but unused vacation benefits (and the related
financial Liability), which are assumed by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)_, TDCC and its Affiliates shall pay to the Transferred US Employees all
compensation, bonuses and incentive payments earned by the Transferred US
Employees through the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Transferred US
Employee who is a Seconded Employee, through the expiration of such Employees
secondment period) in accordance with the terms and conditions (including
within the timing and form specified for payment therefor) of each TDCC
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(d) Except where otherwise required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall,
effective as of the Closing, assume all Liability for all earned or accrued
but unused vacation benefits of the Transferred US Employees, which current
unused vacation benefits for each Transferred US Employee shall be identified
by TDCC within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date in the form of
_Schedule 6.1(d)_ , and TDCC and its Affiliates shall be relieved of all
Liabilities for such benefits. Where required by applicable Law, TDCC and its
Affiliates shall pay out all earned or accrued but unused vacation benefits to
the Transferred US Employees as soon as administratively practicable following
the Closing Date (irrespective of the fact that such Transferred US Employees
will not be employed by TDCC or its Affiliates after the Closing Date).
Purchaser shall permit such Transferred US Employees who receive payment of
their earned or accrued but unused vacation benefits to take vacations after
the Closing that were scheduled before the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all or a portion of any such scheduled vacation may be on an unpaid basis
if and to the extent such vacation or portion thereof is attributable to the
unused accrued vacation benefits paid by TDCC and its Affiliates in accordance
with this _Section 6.1(d)_. Purchaser shall permit each Transferred US
Employee, during the balance of the calendar year during which the Closing
occurs, (i) to accrue additional vacation days, if any, to which the
Transferred US Employee would be entitled for such calendar year under the
vacation policy of AgroFresh or TDCC and its Affiliates covering such
Transferred US Employee immediately prior to the Closing at the rate
applicable to such Transferred US Employee under such vacation policy and (ii)
to take vacation days for the amounts of unused vacation assumed by Purchaser
with respect to each such Transferred US Employee and for the amounts of any
vacation days accrued during the balance of the calendar year during which the
Closing occurs to the extent any such Transferred US Employee could take
vacation days under the vacation policy of TDCC and its Affiliates covering
such Transferred US Employee immediately prior to the Closing. For the
calendar year following that in which the Closing occurs and each year
thereafter, the Transferred US Employees shall, as applicable, receive
vacation benefits under the terms of the vacation benefit policies of
Purchaser applicable to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates, in the case of each such calendar year, after giving pre-Closing
service credit for each Transferred US Employee as provided in _Section
6.1(g)_ below. With respect to each Transferred US Employee who is a

 



      
 

 



 

Seconded Employee, the provisions of this _Section 6.1(d)_ shall apply as of
the expiration of such Employees secondment period.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this _Article
VI_, TDCC or its designated Affiliate shall retain all Liabilities in respect
of benefits earned and accrued as of the Closing Date by Transferred US
Employees (or through the expiration of the Transferred US Employees
secondment period if such Employee is a Seconded Employee) under the TDCC
Benefit Plans, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
Liability with respect thereto. TDCC or its designated Affiliates will retain
all assets and Liabilities related to the TDCC Benefit Plans except with
respect to the earned and accrued but unused vacation assumed by Purchaser,
severance, and rollovers, and except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this _Article
VI_, TDCC and its Affiliates shall retain, bear and discharge all Liabilities
for claims of Transferred US Employees incurred prior to the Closing Date (or
prior to the expiration of the Transferred US Employees secondment period if
such Employee is a Seconded Employee) under the TDCC Benefit Plans, and
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, in the ordinary course of business and in
a manner consistent with past practice (including with respect to the timing
of any payments), bear and discharge all Liabilities for claims of Transferred
US Employees incurred on and after the Closing Date (or, in the case of a
Transferred US Employee who is a Seconded Employee, claims that are incurred
from and after the expiration of such Employees secondment period) under the
Purchaser Benefit Plans. For purposes of this _Section 6.1(f)_, a claim will
be deemed "incurred" on the date that the event that gives rise to the claim
occurs (for purposes of life insurance, severance and
sickness/accident/disability programs) or on the date that treatment or
services are provided (for purposes of health care programs).

 



 

(g) Effective on the Closing Date at the applicable time provided in _Section
8.1_, and for the twenty-four (24) month period following the Closing Date,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide the Transferred US Employees with
employee benefits that satisfy the requirements of this _Article VI_.
Purchaser agrees that Transferred US Employees shall be eligible immediately
to commence participation in the Purchaser Benefit Plans without regard to any
eligibility period, waiting period, elimination period, evidence of
insurability requirements or pre-existing condition limitations. Purchaser
further agrees that the Transferred US Employees shall be eligible to
participate in any future benefit plans adopted or maintained by Purchaser or
its Affiliates in which other similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its
Affiliates are eligible to participate. Purchaser and its Affiliates will
recognize all service of the Transferred US Employees with TDCC or any of its
Affiliates or AgroFresh and with any predecessor employer (to the extent such
predecessor employer service was taken into account under the applicable TDCC
Benefit Plans) for all purposes (including for purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and receive benefits, benefit forms, premium
subsidies or credits, early retirement and waiver of any reduction factors,
and benefit calculations and accruals) under those existing, newly established
and future Purchaser Benefit Plans (including plans providing for retiree
medical benefits and other retiree benefits) in which the Transferred US
Employees are eligible to participate or are enrolled by Purchaser or its
Affiliates at any time on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to
recognize such service for purposes of benefit accruals under the defined
benefit

 



      
 

 



 

pension plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates covering the Transferred US
Employees. With respect to the Transferred US Employees, Purchaser and its
Affiliates further agree to waive deductible and out-of-pocket requirements
under the Purchaser Benefit Plans that provide group health benefits and
otherwise to give credit under the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans for
amounts paid under a corresponding TDCC Benefit Plan that provides group
health benefits, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans; _provided_ ,
_however_ , and only to the extent that, each Transferred US Employee (and his
or her dependents and beneficiaries, as applicable) provides appropriate
written Consent for disclosure to Purchaser or Purchaser Benefit Plans upon
their request of any information reasonably necessary for Purchaser and the
applicable Purchaser Benefit Plans to implement such waiver and credit.
Purchaser further agrees to cause any group term life insurance plan
maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates to waive any medical certification
for such Transferred US Employee up to the amount of coverage the Transferred
US Employee had under the applicable life insurance plan of TDCC or its
Affiliates or AgroFresh (but subject to any limits on the maximum amount of
coverage under the life insurance plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates).

 



 

(h)

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Purchaser shall, for the Transferred US Employees,
establish or designate one or more Purchaser Benefit Plans that are defined
contribution plans for the benefit of the Transferred US Employees (the "
_Successor Savings Plan_ "), and take all necessary action to cause the
Successor Savings Plan to be tax-qualified under the applicable provisions of
the Code (to the extent the Successor Savings Plan is not so tax-qualified),
and make any and all filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities required to be made by Purchaser with respect to the establishment
or designation of such Successor Savings Plan. Purchaser shall take all
actions necessary to allow the Transferred US Employees to make eligible
rollover contributions to the Successor Savings Plan of their account balances
under the savings plans of AgroFresh or TDCC and its Affiliates as soon as
practicable following the Closing.

 



 

(ii) As of the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Transferred US Employee who
is a Seconded Employee, upon the expiration of such Employees secondment
period), the Transferred US Employees shall no longer be active participants
in the TDCC Benefit Plans. Those Transferred US Employees who are vested under
the terms of The Rohm and Haas Company Retirement Plan and the Dow Employees
Pension Plan shall have the same benefit options as normal terminees under
such applicable plan. No pension plan assets or Liabilities will be
transferred to Purchaser or its Affiliates other than as required by
applicable Law; rather, all such assets and Liabilities shall be retained by
the applicable TDCC Benefit Plan sponsored by TDCC or an Affiliate of TDCC
other than as required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred US
Employee any right to continued employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates,
nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of Purchaser or its
Affiliates to relocate or terminate the employment of any of the Transferred
US Employees at any time after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall bear the cost
and expense of the termination of the employment of any Transferred US
Employee on and after the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall,
for each Transferred US Employee who, within twenty-four (24) months following
the Closing Date, (i) is involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates without Good Cause, (ii) has his or her compensation or benefits
reduced other than a reduction by reason of a circumstance that constitutes
Good Cause, and such Transferred US Employee elects to terminate his or her
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, (iii) has a diminution in his or
her position, title, job responsibilities or level of authority or (iv) elects
to terminate his or her employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates following
a requirement that such Transferred US Employee take an alternative position
that requires a Geographic Relocation (or otherwise requires such Transferred
US Employee to undergo a Geographic Relocation), provide severance and other
separation benefits to each such Transferred US Employee that are at least
equal to the greater of (A) the severance and other separation benefits such
Transferred US Employee would have received under the terms of the applicable
severance plan of TDCC or its Affiliates or AgroFresh as of immediately prior
to the Closing and (B) the severance and other separation benefits such
Transferred US Employee would receive under the terms of the applicable
severance plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the time of such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any such
Transferred US Employee receive less than four (4) calendar weeks of severance
and other separation benefits. Purchaser shall bear all Liability for any
claims of any Transferred US Employee arising out of the employment or
termination of such Transferred US Employee by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

Except as expressly set forth herein or as provided to the contrary by
applicable local Law, Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities in
respect of benefits accrued on and after the Closing Date by Transferred US
Employees under the Purchaser Benefit Plans, and neither TDCC nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any Liability with respect thereto. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall take all steps necessary to cause all Purchaser Benefit Plans
to fulfill the Liabilities agreed to by Purchaser under this _Article VI_.

 



 

(j) _WARN Act_. Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to assume full
responsibility for compliance with any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any
similar state or local Law, including notices, if any, which may be required
as a result of any employment losses caused by the transaction or by reason of
any events occurring on or after the Closing Date in relation to any of the
Transferred US Employees.

 



 

6.2 _Remaining Employees_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 6.2(a)_ sets forth a preliminary list of the titles and
locations of individuals who are employed by TDCC and its Affiliates outside
of the United States in connection with the Business (other than the Affected
French Business Employees) and who have been identified by TDCC as being in-
scope with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Remaining Employees_ "). Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _11.16_ to the contrary and subject to applicable Law, TDCC may update
_Schedule 6.2(a)_ prior to the Closing Date to provide the names of each
Remaining Employee and to reflect changes, if any, on account of: (i) new
hires added, and separations occurring, in the ordinary course of business
prior to the Closing Date; (ii) attrition among the Remaining Employees prior
to the Closing Date; (iii) non-material changes intended to correct good faith
errors or omissions by TDCC in determining which Remaining Employees are in-
scope for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) any Remaining
Employees who reject an offer of employment from Purchaser or its designated
Affiliates; (v) changes that in the sole discretion of TDCC are necessary for
completion of the Restructuring Transactions; and (vi) other changes agreed to
between the parties hereto. TDCC shall provide to Purchaser a final version of
_Schedule 6.2(a)_ on the Closing Date setting forth all of the Remaining
Employees.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the Remaining Employees are transferred to Purchaser or its
designated Affiliates with effect from the Closing Date, whether the transfer
is: (a) implemented through the operation of applicable Law; (b) through the
process of Purchasers offering to employ, effective as of and from the
Closing Date, the Remaining Employees; or (c) by any other applicable means.
In the event that the parties hereto are not able to provide for a Remaining
Employee to transfer to Purchaser or a designated Affiliate of Purchaser with
effect from the Closing Date, then TDCC and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Remaining Employee to remain an
employee of TDCC and its Affiliates for a transition period not to exceed six
(6) months following the Closing Date and to be available to Purchaser and its
Affiliates for the performance of services during such transition period
pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement. Each Remaining
Employee who is or becomes an employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
as of or (in the case of a Remaining Employee covered by the Transition
Services Agreement for a transition period or a Remaining Employee covered by
the Seconding Agreement for a secondment period) after the Closing shall be
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Remaining Employee_ ". Except where
otherwise required by applicable Law, (i) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, effective as of or (in the case of a Remaining Employee covered
by the Transition Services Agreement for a transition period or a Remaining
Employee covered by the Seconding Agreement for a secondment period) after the
Closing, assume all Liability for all earned or accrued but unused vacation
benefits of the Transferred Remaining Employees and TDCC and its Affiliates
shall be relieved of all Liabilities for such benefits and (ii) Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that, during the twenty-four (24) month period following the Closing
Date, the Transferred Remaining Employees receive protections with respect to
terms and conditions of employment and base salary and bonus opportunities
that are no less favorable to such Transferred Remaining Employees than those
provided immediately prior to the Closing and benefits to such Transferred
Remaining Employees that are substantially comparable in value, when taken as
a whole, to the benefits provided under the TDCC Benefit Plans in which such
Transferred Remaining Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such comparability may be made on an aggregate
basis for the Transferred Remaining Employees as a whole and not individually
for each Transferred Remaining Employee. The current accrued but unused
vacation benefits for each Transferred Remaining Employee shall be identified
by TDCC within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date in the form of
_Schedule 6.2(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

6.3 _French Employees_. Immediately upon a Put Option Exercise Event, this
_Section 6.3_ shall apply to the Affected French Business Employees without
any further action by the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, until and unless a Put Option
Exercise Event occurs, no Affected French Business Employees shall be deemed
to be Transferred French Employees. _Schedule 6.3(a)_ sets forth a
preliminary list of the titles and locations of the Affected French Business
Employees as of the date hereof. TDCC shall provide to Purchaser a final
version of _Schedule 6.3(a)_ on the Closing Date setting forth all of the
Affected French Business Employees. With respect to the Affected French
Business Employees to be listed in _Schedule 6.3(a)_ , the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that after the occurrence of a Put Option Exercise
Event, the subsequent transfer of the French Assets pursuant to the French
Transfer Agreement shall constitute transfers of the undertakings pursuant to
Article L.1224-1 of the French Labor Code and that the parties hereto shall,
and shall cause their applicable Affiliates to, comply with the applicable
requirements of Article L.1224-1 of the French Labor Code.

 



 

(a) The following additional defined terms apply to this _Section 6.3_:

 



 

(i) " _Affected French Business Employees_ " means those employees of TDCC or
its Affiliates in France who are primarily devoted to the Business and to whom
Article L.1224-1 of the French Labor Code applies.

 



 

(ii) " _Protected French Business Employees_ " means those Affected French
Business Employees whose transfer to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser is
subject to the prior authorization of the French labor inspector.

 



 

(iii) " _Transferred French Employees_ " means, subject to the occurrence of a
Put Option Exercise Event and completion of the transactions contemplated by
the Put Option Agreement, including the Consultation Proceeding (as defined in
the Put Option Agreement) and any required prior authorization by the French
labor inspector with respect to any Protected French Business Employee, those
Affected French Business Employees who are or become employees of Purchaser as
of the consummation of the transfer of French Assets pursuant to the French
Asset Transfer Agreement, all in accordance with the Put Option Agreement,
French Asset Transfer Agreement and applicable provisions of the French Labor
Code. The date on which an Affected French Business Employee transfers to
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate shall be referred to herein as a "
_French Employee Transfer Date_."

 



 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Affected French Business Employees
include one (1) Protected French Business Employee, who will be separately
designated on the updated _Schedule 6.3(a)_ , whose transfer to Purchaser or
an Affiliate of Purchaser is subject to the prior authorization of the French
labor inspector. TDCC will request (or will cause to be requested) the
authorization of the labor inspector to transfer the Protected French Business
Employee in accordance with the provisions of the French Labor Code. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the transfer of the employment
Contract(s) of the Protected French Business Employee to Purchaser or an
Affiliate of Purchaser will only be effective as from the date on which the
authorization of the labor inspector is obtained. TDCC

 



      
 

 



 

will use reasonable efforts to obtain the authorization of the French labor
inspector to transfer the Protected French Business Employee. TDCC agrees to
inform Purchaser of the receipt of such authorization. Notwithstanding
anything in _Section 6.3(a)(iii)_ to the contrary, if the French labor
inspectors authorization is obtained after the French Employee Transfer Date
of the Affected French Business Employees who are not Protected French
Business Employees, the Protected French Business Employee shall become a
Transferred French Employee effective as from the date on which the
authorization is obtained and such date shall be the French Employee Transfer
Date with respect to the Protected French Business Employee. If the French
labor inspector refuses the transfer of the Protected French Business
Employee, the parties hereto agree that the Protected French Business Employee
will not transfer employment to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and neither
TDCC nor Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification from any other party hereto with respect to such Protected
French Business Employee.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any unilateral undertaking
and custom applicable to Affected French Business Employees, as listed on
_Schedule 6.3(a)_ , shall continue to apply collectively to the Transferred
French Employees after the Closing Date, to the extent such unilateral
undertaking and custom are applicable to the Transferred French Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the mandatory profit sharing
scheme applicable to the Affected French Business Employees prior to the
French Employee Transfer Date(s) ( _Accord de participation de groupe d
erogatoire_) shall no longer be applicable to an Affected French Business
Employee after such Affected French Business Employees French Employee
Transfer Date, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall implement a new scheme,
in accordance with the requirements of Section L.3323-8 of the French Labor
Code.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article VI_ to the contrary, the
transfer of the Affected French Business Employees and Protected French
Business Employee to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall result in the
transfer of all rights, duties, Liabilities related to such Affected French
Business Employees to Purchaser and its Affiliates. Accordingly, Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall, as of the French Employee Transfer Date(s), be fully
responsible for, and bear all costs in relation to, all Liabilities related to
the Transferred French Employees, including any salaries or other costs, paid
holidays, thirteenth-month pay, time saving accounts, bonus, pension
Liabilities, Taxes and social security charges.

 



 

(f) Subject to applicable Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, ensure that the Transferred French Employees receive protections with
respect to terms and conditions of employment and compensation and benefits
that are no less favorable to such Transferred French Employees than those
provided to the Transferred French Employees by TDCC or one of its Affiliates
prior to the French Employee Transfer Date(s). The current unused vacation
benefits for each Transferred French Employee shall be identified by TDCC
within thirty (30) days after the French Employee Transfer Date(s) in the form
of _Schedule 6.3(f)_.

 



       
 

 



 

6.4 _Seconded Employees_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the US Employees and Remaining Employees identified on _Schedule
6.4_ (each, a " _Seconded Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Seconded
Employees_ "), which _Schedule 6.4_ shall be provided by TDCC to Purchaser
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, who otherwise
would become Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date shall instead be
seconded to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser in accordance with the
terms of an applicable seconding agreement, substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Seconding Agreement_ "), with such secondments
to be effective from the Closing Date up to and including the respective dates
set forth in the Seconding Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
secondment period under the Seconding Agreement shall exceed six (6) full
calendar months after the Closing Date. TDCC expects the number of Seconded
Employees to be ten (10) or fewer US Employees and Remaining Employees in the
aggregate. Effective upon the expiration of the Seconded Employees secondment
period, such Seconded Employee shall transfer to Purchaser or a designated
Affiliate of Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1(b)_
(in the case of Seconded Employees who are US Employees) or _Section 6.2(b)_
(in the case of Seconded Employees who are Remaining Employees) and each such
Seconded Employee who becomes an employee of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing shall be a Transferred Employee as of the
expiration of the Seconded Employees secondment period, and any obligations
of Purchaser and its Affiliates hereunder with respect to any such Seconded
Employee shall not commence until such Seconded Employee becomes a Transferred
Employee.

 



 

6.5 _Employee Matters Indemnity_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall indemnify
and hold harmless TDCC and its Affiliates, and each of their respective
officers, directors and employees, from all costs, expenses or other damages
that may result in respect of claims made by any Employee or Transferred
Employee, as applicable, for (a) severance or other separation benefits
arising out of or in connection with Purchasers or its Affiliates employment
of, Purchasers or its Affiliates failure to provide notice of employment or
an offer of employment to, or Purchasers or its Affiliates termination of
employment of, any Transferred Employee not in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or the provisions of applicable Law and (b) any failure of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to discharge their respective obligations under
this _Article VI_.

 



 

6.6 _Workers  Compensation_. Except as otherwise provided under an applicable
workers compensation insurance policy or fund or as otherwise determined by
an applicable Governmental Authority with respect to workers compensation,
TDCC and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all workers compensation
claims by any Employee arising out of any injuries and diseases incurred,
sustained, or resulting from work-related exposures or conditions prior to the
Closing Date (regardless of whether the claim related thereto is filed after
the Closing). Purchaser shall be responsible for all workers compensation
claims by any of the Transferred Employees arising out of any injuries and
diseases incurred, sustained, or resulting from work-related exposures or
conditions on or after the Closing, including any compensable acceleration or
aggravation occurring on or after the Closing Date of any pre-Closing illness
or injuries. For purposes of this _Section 6.6_, references to the "Closing"
and the "Closing Date" mean (a) with respect to each Transferred French
Employee, the applicable "French Employee Transfer Date" in each case, (b)
with respect to each Remaining Employee covered by the Transition Services
Agreement for a transition period, the applicable date as of which the
Remaining Employee becomes a Transferred Remaining Employee, and (c) and with
respect to each Transferred

 



      
 

 



 

Employee who was a Seconded Employee, the applicable date as of which the
Employees secondment period expired.

 



 

6.7 _Payment of Obligations_. TDCC and its Affiliates shall pay to the
Transferred Remaining Employees and the Transferred French Employees all
compensation, bonuses and incentive payments earned by the Transferred
Remaining Employees and Transferred French Employees through the Closing Date
(or through the expiration of the employees secondment period in the case of
Transferred Remaining Employees who are Seconded Employees or through the
applicable French Employee Transfer Date(s) with respect to the Transferred
French Employees or through the end of the applicable transition period in the
case of Transferred Remaining Employees who are covered by the Transition
Services Agreement for a transition period) in accordance with the terms and
conditions (including within the timing and form specified for payment
therefor) of each TDCC Benefit Plan.

ARTICLE X 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

10.1 _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and
warranties contained herein or in any certificate delivered in connection with
this Agreement and each covenant contained herein that requires performance
prior to the Closing shall terminate effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing such that no claim for breach of any such representation or warranty,

the Closing until the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing, (b) _Section

and nothing in this _Section 10.1_ shall limit the right of any party to
bring a claim for breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement that
requires performance at or after the Closing.

 



 

10.2 _Indemnification by TDCC_. From and after the Closing, subject to the
provisions of this _Article X_ (including the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.4_), TDCC shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to)
indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified
Party_ ") against, be liable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for and hold
each Purchaser Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by each Purchaser Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of any
of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental Representation made by TDCC
in _Article III_; and

 



 

(b) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representation set forth in _Section
3.4(b)_.

 



 

10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the provisions of this _Article X_ (including the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.4_), Purchaser shall

 



      
 

 



 

indemnify TDCC and its Affiliates (each, a " _TDCC Indemnified Party_ ")
against, be liable to the TDCC Indemnified Parties for and hold each TDCC
Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by
each TDCC Indemnified Party to the extent arising out of any breach of or
inaccuracy in any Fundamental Representation made by Purchaser in _Article
IV_;

 



 

10.4 _Limitations on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any right or remedy available under any Law:

 



 

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right to payment by TDCC
under _Section 10.2(b)_ only if, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall have incurred, (i) as to any individual claim under
_Section 10.2(b)_, an indemnifiable Loss in excess of one hundred thousand
Dollars ($100,000) and (ii) as to all claims under _Section 10.2(b)_,
indemnifiable Losses in excess of forty million Dollars ($40,000,000) in the
aggregate (the " _Claims Deductible_ ") (in determining whether the Claims
Deductible has been satisfied, only Losses for claims under _Section 10.2(b)_
exceeding the per claim threshold set forth in the foregoing _clause (i)_
shall be included), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have
a right to payment only to the extent that Losses satisfy the requirements set
forth in _clause (i)_ and _clause (ii)_.

 



 

(b) TDCC shall have no Liability under or otherwise in connection with this
_Article X_ in excess of (i) as to _Section 3.4(b)_, two hundred million
Dollars ($200,000,000) in the aggregate, and (ii) as to the Fundamental
Representations, an amount equal to the Purchase Price; _provided_ that in no
event shall the aggregate amount of TDCCs Liability under _clause (i)_ and
_clause (ii)_ exceed the Purchase Price. Purchaser shall have no Liability
under or otherwise in connection with this _Article X_ in excess of an amount
equal to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) The limitations set forth in this _Section 10.4_ shall not apply with
respect to TDCCs or Purchasers fraud and such Person shall be liable to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the TDCC Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
for the full amount of Losses resulting from, arising out of or related to
such fraud.

 



 

10.5 _Claims_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware
of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a Third
Party Claim, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
first becoming aware of such claim, the Indemnified Person shall give written
notice to the Indemnifying Person of such claim in accordance herewith (a "
_Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent (if any)
that the Indemnifying Person shall have been materially prejudiced thereby.
The Claim Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (a) the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such claim for indemnification, including all
relevant supporting documentation, (b) the nature of the Losses suffered or
incurred or expected to be suffered or incurred, (c) a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Losses have been
suffered or incurred or are expected to be suffered or incurred, (d) the
amount of Losses actually suffered or incurred and, to the extent the Losses
have not yet been suffered or incurred, a good faith estimate of the amount of
Losses that could be expected to be suffered or incurred and (e) such other
information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that
the limitations in this _Article X_ (including the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.4_) have been

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied or do not apply.

 



 

10.6 _Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnified
Person shall give a Claim Notice (in the form contemplated by _Section 10.5_)
as promptly as is reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days after receiving notice thereof, to the Indemnifying Person
of the assertion of any claims, or the commencement of any Proceeding, by any
Person who is not an Indemnified Person in respect of which claims for
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under
this Agreement except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person
shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own
expense, (a) participate in the defense of any such Third Party Claim and (b)
upon written notice to the Indemnified Person, at any time during the course
of any such Third Party Claim, assume the defense thereof with counsel of its
own choice and in the event of such assumption, shall have the exclusive
right, subject to _clause (a)_ in the proviso in _Section 10.7_, to settle
or compromise such Third Party Claim, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Person
obtain as a condition of any settlement or other compromise, a complete
release of the Indemnified Person subject to such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have
the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend
or prosecute any such Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, including all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Persons
possession or under the Indemnified Persons control relating thereto (or in
the possession or control of any of its Representatives) as is reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Person or its counsel.

 



 

10.7 _Settlement or Compromise_. Any settlement or compromise made or caused
to be made by the Indemnified Person (unless the Indemnifying Person has the
exclusive right to settle or compromise under _clause (b)_ of _Section
10.6_) or the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any such Third Party
Claim shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified
Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or
decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of
such settlement or compromise; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) no Liability,
restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of
such settlement or compromise without its prior written Consent, which Consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (b) the
Indemnified Person shall not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim
without the prior written Consent of the Indemnifying Person.

 



 

10.8 _Time Limits_. Any right to indemnification or other recovery under this
_Article X_ shall apply only to Losses with respect to which the Indemnified
Person shall have notified the Indemnifying Person in writing within the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_ and in accordance with
_Section 10.5_ or _10.6_ , as applicable. If any claim for indemnification or
other recovery is timely asserted under this _Article X_, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right to bring a Proceeding with respect to such claim
after the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section
10.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

10.9 _Mitigation; Net Losses_.

 



 

(a) In the event of any Loss that may give rise to an indemnification
obligation hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of
such Loss, including (i) cooperating with the Indemnifying Person, if so
requested by the Indemnifying Person and (ii) taking all such reasonable
measures that are required to prevent any contingent Liability from becoming
an actual Liability. If any Indemnified Person shall fail to take such
measures specified in _clause (i)_ or _clause (ii)_ , then notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Person shall not
be required to indemnify the Indemnified Person for any Loss that would
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such efforts had been made.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person shall be calculated
after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received from unaffiliated
third parties by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with
respect to such Losses, (ii) any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified
Person (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the facts or circumstances
giving rise to such Losses or by the Indemnified Person (or any of its
Affiliates) from any indemnification payment with respect to such Losses, and
(iii) any recoveries obtained by the Indemnified Person (or any of its
Affiliates) from any other unaffiliated third party, and (iv) any amounts
recorded in the Historical Financial Information with regard to such Losses.
If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified
Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after the
Indemnifying Person has made a payment to the Indemnified Person with respect
thereto, the Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate) shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Person the amount of such proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to
the amount of the Indemnifying Persons payment with respect to such Losses).

 



 

10.10 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. To the extent permitted by Law, any
amounts payable under _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ shall be treated by
Purchaser and TDCC as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that an
adjustment is made to or taken into account in determining the Purchase Price
or any payments are made in respect of any matter relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any
indemnification or any other payment with respect to such matter to the extent
of such adjustment or payment and such matter will not, to the extent of such
adjustment or other payment, constitute a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.

 



 

10.11 _Knowledge_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
after the Closing, no Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of such Indemnifying Person
contained in this Agreement, or any breach of or failure to perform any
covenant or obligation by such Indemnifying Person, in any such case if the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates had knowledge, at or before the
Closing, of the facts as a result of which such representation or warranty was
breached or inaccurate or such covenant or obligation was breached or not
performed. The parties understand and agree that the knowledge of Persons who
are employees of TDCC or its Affiliates or any AgroFresh Entity immediately
before Closing shall not be imputed to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for
purposes of this _Section 10.11_.

 



       
 

 



 

10.12 _References_. All references in _Section 3.4(b)_ to "material" shall be
excluded with regard to both (i) determining whether any inaccuracy in or
breach of such representation has occurred and (ii) determining the amount of
any Losses in connection therewith.

itself by notice given as herein provided.

 



 

11.3 _United States Dollars_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in a
Local Transfer Agreement, all payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire
transfer in Dollars in immediately available funds without any set-off,
deduction or counterclaim whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth herein or
therein, any Contract, Liability, claim or document referred to in this
Agreement (including any amount included in the calculation of the Working
Capital Target or the Closing Working Capital) that is denominated in a
currency other than Dollars, will be deemed, for purposes of this Agreement,
to be converted into Dollars using TDCCs internal trading rate in effect on
the Closing Date (the " _Conversion Rate_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Closing Date is a date other than the last day of a month, the Conversion
Rate shall be TDCCs internal trading rate in effect on the last day of the
month preceding the month in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

11.4 _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof or claim damages with respect thereto
shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same. No
waiver by a party of any condition or of any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be effective
unless it is in a writing signed by such party, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other condition
or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty.

 



 

11.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment of this Agreement or any
rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, may be made
by any party without the written Consent of the other party, other than, in
the case of TDCC only, to an Affiliate of TDCC (but no such assignment shall
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder). Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be null and void _ab initio_.

 



 

11.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
5.15_, this Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and

 



      
 

 



 

permitted assigns and, to the extent provided herein, their respective
Affiliates, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Without
limiting the preceding sentence, no provision of _Article VI_ shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of AgroFresh or TDCC or any
of its Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)
with either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and no provision of _Article
VI_ shall create any such rights in any such Person in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any TDCC Benefit Plan or
any Purchaser Benefit Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided
in this _Section 11.6_, Committed Lenders shall be express third party
beneficiaries of _Section 11.1_, this _Section 11.6_, _Section 11.13_,
_Section 11.14_, and _Section 11.15_

 



 

11.7 _Publicity_. No public announcement or other publicity regarding the
existence of this Agreement or the Related Agreements or its or their contents
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be made by Purchaser,
AgroFresh, TDCC or any of their respective Representatives without the prior
written Consent of Purchaser and TDCC, in any case, as to form, content,
timing and manner of distribution or publication (which Consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the prior written Consent of the other party shall not be required hereunder
with respect to any press release, public announcement or communication that
is substantially similar to a press release, public announcement or
communication previously issued with the prior written Consent of such other
party. Each of TDCC and Purchaser agrees to hold confidential the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 11.7_ shall prevent either party or its Affiliates
or any other Person from making any public announcement or disclosure required
by Law or the rules of any stock exchange.

11.15 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that, in the event of any non-
performance or breach of this Agreement, the non-performing or non-breaching
party, as the case may be would be immediately and irreparably harmed by such
non-performance or breach and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It
is accordingly agreed that, with respect to any such non-performance or
breach, each party hereto (a) shall waive, in any action for equitable relief
(including specific performance, injunctive relief and any other equitable
remedy), the defense of adequate remedy at law and (b) shall, in addition to
any other right or remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled, at law or
in equity (including monetary damages), be entitled to equitable relief
(including the compelling of specific performance of this Agreement,
injunctive relief and any other equitable remedy) with no obligation to prove
actual damages or post any bond in connection therewith, in any action
instituted in accordance with _Section 11.14_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the TDCC shall be
entitled to enforce specifically Purchasers obligations under _Section 5.3_
and Purchasers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and to pay the
Cash Consideration and issue the Stock Consideration) if the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied (other than the
conditions that by their terms are not to be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to the waiver or fulfillment of such conditions at the Closing). The
parties hereto agree that they will not contest the appropriateness of
specific performance as a remedy. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall TDCC or any of its Affiliates (other than,
following the Closing, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) bring any Proceeding
against, or otherwise seek any monetary damages or any equitable remedy or
specific performance from, or in respect of, any Committed Lender (or any of
such financial institutions Affiliates and their and their Affiliates
respective directors, officers and employees) in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters or any transaction contemplated hereby
or thereby. TDCC and its Affiliates (other than, following the Closing,
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) hereby waive all claims or causes of action,
whether in law or equity, against any Committed Lender (or any of such
financial institutions Affiliates and their and their Affiliates respective
directors, officers and employees) arising out of this Agreement, any Debt
Commitment Letter or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

(b) **In no event shall either party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates or AgroFresh or any Committed Lender (or any of such financial
institution s Affiliates and their and their Affiliates respective
directors, officers and employees) have any liability under this Agreement or
any Local Transfer Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Restructuring Transactions) or thereby for
any special, punitive, exemplary, speculative, indirect, remote or
consequential damages, damages for lost profits or damages based upon a
multiple of earnings or diminution in value or any similar damages, regardless
of whether such damages were foreseeable.**

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive Liability and
responsibility of the parties hereto and the parties to the Local Transfer
Agreements (and, in each case, their respective Affiliates) and AgroFresh
under or in connection with (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in _Section
3.4(b)_ or a Fundamental Representation (regardless of the theory upon

 



      
 

 



 

which any claim may be based, whether contract, equity, tort, fraud, warranty,
strict liability or any other theory of liability), and the sole and exclusive
remedy of such Persons with respect to any of the foregoing, shall be as set
forth in _Article X_; and (ii) any breach of or in accuracy in _Section 3.7_
(regardless of the theory upon which any claim may be based, whether contract,
equity, tort, fraud, warranty, strict liability or any other theory of
liability), and the sole and exclusive remedy of such Persons with respect to
any of the foregoing, shall be as set forth in _Section 5.11(c)_. In the
event the Closing occurs, in no event shall any party be entitled to
rescission of the transactions consummated hereby. None of the parties hereto,
their respective Affiliates nor any other Person (including AgroFresh) may
bring a claim under any Local Transfer Agreement (except as expressly provided
therein), and any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the
Business, any Local Transfer Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Restructuring Transactions) must be brought
under and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that,
from and after the Closing, any party hereto or any party to a Local Transfer
Agreement or AgroFresh has any Losses for which it would otherwise be entitled
to assert any claim or right to indemnification, contribution or recovery
against any other party hereto or to a Local Transfer Agreement (or any of
their Affiliates) in connection with any Local Transfer Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Restructuring
Transactions) other than pursuant to the exclusive remedies described in this
_Section 11.15(c)_, (i) TDCC hereby waives, releases and agrees not to assert
such claim or right, and TDCC agrees to cause each of its Affiliates and, with
respect to the period prior to the Closing, AgroFresh, to waive, release and
agree not to assert such claim or right and (ii) Purchaser hereby waives,
releases and agrees not to assert such claim or right, and Purchaser agrees to
cause each of its Affiliates to waive, release and agree not to assert such
claim or right, in each case regardless of the theory upon which any claim may
be based, whether contract, equity, tort, fraud, warranty, strict liability or
any other theory of liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this _Section 11.15(c)_ shall not apply to the Put Option
Agreement or the French Asset Transfer Agreement (each as defined in _Exhibit
K_) or the transactions contemplated thereby unless and until the transactions
contemplated thereby have been consummated.

 



 

(d) With respect to any obligation of TDCC pursuant to this Agreement to cause
or otherwise bring about any action by any of its Affiliates or AgroFresh, in
the event that such action is not taken by the applicable Affiliate or
AgroFresh, neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall have any cause of action
against such Affiliate of TDCC or AgroFresh.

 



 

(e) Neither TDCC nor any of its Affiliates nor AgroFresh shall have any
Liability under or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any Local
Transfer Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby for any
Loss (i) to the extent arising from any action or inaction by TDCC or its
Affiliates or AgroFresh, (A) if TDCC or its Affiliates or AgroFresh were
required or permitted to take such action or required or permitted not to take
such action, in each case, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (B) if
TDCC or its Affiliates or AgroFresh were required to take such action or
required not to take such action, in each case, pursuant to applicable Law, or
(C) Purchaser has directed or requested TDCC or any of its Affiliates or
AgroFresh to take or to not take such action; (ii) to the extent arising from
or relating to any matter disclosed in any Schedule or in the virtual data
room made available to Purchaser by TDCC in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the index of which as of the date hereof is
set forth on _Schedule 11.15_ ; (iii) to the extent arising from

 



      
 

 



 

a change in Law that becomes effective on or after the Closing Date; (iv) to
the extent arising as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Purchaser or its Affiliates; or (v) to the extent such Loss is provided for
in, or otherwise could have been taken into account in, the Closing Working
Capital Statement.

 



 

11.16 _Schedules_. Any information disclosed pursuant to any Schedule hereto
shall be deemed to be disclosed in each other Schedule to the extent its
applicability to such other Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face to
Purchaser. Neither the specification of any Dollar amount or any item or
matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific
item or matter in any Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so specified or included, or
other items or matters, are or are not material, and no party shall use the
fact of the specification of any such amount or the specification or inclusion
of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any item or matter not specified herein or included in any
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Neither the
specification of any item or matter in any provision of this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item or matter in any Schedule is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business or in a manner consistent with past practice, and
no party shall use the fact of the specification or the inclusion of any such
item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any item or matter not specified herein or included in any Schedule is or is
not in the ordinary course of business or in a manner consistent with past
practice for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

11.17 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
III_, none of TDCC, its Affiliates or AgroFresh or any of their respective
Representatives has made, in connection with Purchasers investigation of the
Business or otherwise, any representation or warranty, express or implied,
including with respect to (A) merchantability or fitness for any particular
use or purpose; (B) the operation of the Business by Purchaser after the
Closing; (C) the probable success or profitability of the Business after the
Closing or (D) the accuracy or completeness of any information, written or
oral, relating to the Business, including the information set forth in the
immediately following sentence (the " _Business Information_ "). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that none of
TDCC or AgroFresh or their respective Representatives has made or is making
any representation or warranty with respect to (and Purchaser has not relied
on) (a) any projections, forecasts or forward-looking statements made or made
available to Purchaser or its Representatives or (b) any memoranda, charts,
summaries (including summary of the terms of certain agreements), schedules or
other information about the Business or its operations made available to
Purchaser or its Representatives (including the CIM, any information provided
to Purchaser or its Representatives by any financial advisor for TDCC or any
of TDCCs Affiliates or AgroFresh, and any information, documents or materials
made available to Purchaser or its Representatives, whether orally or in
writing, in certain "data rooms," management presentations, functional "break-
out" discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser or
its Representatives or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), except as expressly set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement. Purchaser agrees that none of TDCC or AgroFresh or any
of their respective Representatives shall have any Liability to Purchaser or
its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Business
Information or any errors or inaccuracies therein or

 



      
 

 



 

omissions therefrom, except for any Liability resulting from the breach of the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this
Agreement, but subject to the limitations and restrictions set forth herein.
Purchaser also agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, neither it nor any of
its Representatives has relied upon any representations or warranties of any
nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to TDCC or AgroFresh or their
respective Representatives, and Purchaser acknowledges that, in entering into
this Agreement, it has relied solely on the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement, subject to the
limitations and restrictions specified herein.

 



 

11.18 _Privileged Communications_. Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself and,
after the Closing, on behalf of AgroFresh, that all communications in any form
or format whatsoever between or among Mayer Brown LLP or any other legal
counsel to any of AgroFresh (including, in-house legal counsel), on the one
hand, and AgroFresh or any of its Representatives, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the preparation for or negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute
arising under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_
") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and that the Privileged
Communications and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto
belong solely to TDCC and may be controlled by TDCC and shall not pass to or
be claimed by Purchaser or AgroFresh. Notwithstanding anything set forth in
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 11.18_ to the contrary, in the
event that after the Closing a dispute arises between Purchaser or AgroFresh,
on the one hand, and a third party other than a party to this Agreement, on
the other hand, AgroFresh may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of Privileged Communications to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Purchaser nor AgroFresh may waive such privilege
without the prior written Consent of TDCC.

 



 

11.19 _Certain Agreements and Actions_. Purchaser acknowledges that it has
agreed (a) pursuant to _Section 8.2_, that TDCC shall cause to be delivered
to Purchaser at the Closing the Transition Services Agreement, the India
Transition Services Agreement and the Bailment Agreement, each duly executed
by an AgroFresh or one of its Affiliates; and (b) pursuant to _Section
5.11(b)_, that TDCC take certain actions in respect of the transition of
AgroFresh to a standalone business operation. Purchaser agrees that, as of and
immediately following the Closing, (i) each of the Transition Services
Agreement, India Transition Services Agreement and Bailment Agreement shall be
a valid and legally binding agreement, enforceable against AgroFresh (in the
case of the Transition Services Agreement and India Transition Services
Agreement) and its applicable Affiliate (in the case of the Bailment
Agreement) in accordance with its respective terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations, and Purchaser shall not raise any defense to the
validity or enforceability of the Transition Services Agreement, India
Transition Services Agreement or Bailment Agreement based on the fact that it
was executed while the parties thereto were under control of TDCC and (ii)
TDCC and its Affiliates shall have no Liability to Purchaser or any Affiliate
of Purchaser arising out of or relating to any action (or failing to take any
action) by TDCC or its Affiliates in connection with the efforts contemplated
by _Section 5.11(b)_.

 



 

11.20 _Trust Account_. Dow hereby agrees that it does not have any right,
title, interest or claim arising out of this Agreement in or to any monies in
the Trust Account and waives, solely

 



      
 

 



 

in connection with this Agreement, any such claim it may have in the future
solely as a result of, or arising out of, any breach by Purchaser of this
Agreement, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account, in each case
solely in connection with this Agreement, _provided_ that (a) nothing in this
_Section 11.20_ shall limit the right of TDCC to pursue a claim against
Purchaser for legal relief against monies or other assets held outside the
Trust Account or for specific performance or other equitable relief (including
a claim for Purchaser to specifically perform its obligations under this
Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in
the Trust Account to TDCC in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Trust Agreement); and (b) nothing in this _Section 11.20_ shall limit any
claims that TDCC may have in the future against Purchasers assets or funds
that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been
released from the Trust Account and any assets that have been purchased or
acquired with any such funds). The covenants and obligations set forth in this
section shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

 



 

11.21 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by .pdf file exchanged via email or other electronic
transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

2015 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things,
Purchaser and its designated Affiliates have agreed to purchase from TDCC and
its Affiliates, and TDCC and its Affiliates have agreed to sell to Purchaser

NOW THEREFORE, in view of their respective covenants set forth below, the
parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****_The Property_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Property includes only the Inventory and equipment described on
_Exhibit A_ to this Agreement, as such _Exhibit A_ may be amended or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with _Section 6_.

 



 

(b) All of the Property will at all times be and remain the sole property of
AF France. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as
granting Dow France a lien, security interest or encumbrance on the Property.

      
 

 



 

(c) AF France will be responsible for any personal property taxes assessed
against the Property, and will also be responsible for obtaining and
maintaining insurance on the Property at appropriate levels.

 



 

(d) Dow France will hold the Property as a bailee for AF France, but will not
be responsible for any loss or damage to the Property while in Dow Frances

negligence or willful misconduct while such Property is in Dow Frances
possession and control.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****_Removal of the Property_** **.** Upon the Termination Date
(defined below) or upon such earlier date mutually agreed upon by the parties,

writing signed by both Dow France and AF France.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****_Waivers_** **.** The failure of a party hereto at any time or
times to require performance of any provision hereof or claim damages with
respect thereto shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce
the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of any breach of any term,
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be
effective unless it is in a writing signed by such party, and no waiver in any
one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of

remedy of the Company (whether any such claim arises in contract, tort, breach
of warranty or any other legal or

Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in such Registration
shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such Underwritten
Offering and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All such Holders

determined that the Registration Statement be abandoned or withdrawn with
respect to its Registrable Securities, in which event the Company shall
abandon or withdraw such Registration Statement and notify all other Holders
participating in such Demand Registration. In such event, such withdrawn
Registration shall not be counted as a Demand Registration effected under
_Section 2(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _Section 2(e)_.

Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by

 



      
 

 



 

the Company and by the stockholders of the Company including pursuant to
_Section 2_), other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection
with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange
offer or offering of securities solely to the Companys existing stockholders,
(iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of
the Company or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall
give written notice of such proposed filing to all of the Holders of
Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but not less than ten (10) days
before the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement, which
notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in
such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the
proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and
(B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to
register the sale of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may
request in writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice
(such Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good
faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the
Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this _Section
3(a)_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and
conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such
Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through
an Underwritten Offering under this _Section 3(a)_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

 



 

(b) _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a Piggyback
Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of Common Stock that the Company desires to
sell, taken together with (i) Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration
has been demanded pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with
Persons other than the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the
Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested pursuant
_Section 3_, and (iii) Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has
been requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back
registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum
Number of Securities, then:

 



 

(i) If the Registration is undertaken for the Companys account, the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or other equity
securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause
(A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 3(a)_, Pro Rata, that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to
the extent that the Maximum Number

 



      
 

 



 

of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of
the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities;

 



 

(ii) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by Persons other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall include in any such
Registration (A) first, Common Stock or other equity securities, if any, of
such requesting Persons, other than the Holders of Registrable Securities,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Section 3(a),_ Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D)
fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), Common Stock or other
equity securities for the account of other Persons that the Company is
obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements
with such Persons, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities.

 



 

(c) _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable Securities
shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no
reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the Underwriter
or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from such
Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the SEC with respect to such Piggyback Registration. The
Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a
request for withdrawal by Persons pursuant to separate written contractual
obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the SEC in
connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _Section 3(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity, any
Registration effected pursuant to _Section 3_ shall not be counted as a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under _Section 2_.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _Selection of Underwriters_ _._ If any Piggyback Registration is an
Underwritten Offering, the Company will have the right to select the
Underwriters and to manage such offering.

 



 

4. **_Registrations on Form S-3_** **. **The Holders of Registrable Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that the Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the SEC), register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 (" _Form S-3_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect such request through an Underwritten Offering. Within five (5) days of the Companys receipt of a written request from a Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall promptly give written notice of the proposed Registration on Form S-3 to all other Holders of Registrable Securities, and each Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in such Registration on Form S-3 shall so notify the Company, in writing, within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. As soon as practicable thereafter, but not more than twelve (12) days after the Companys initial receipt of such written request for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall register all or such portion of such Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such written request, together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such Registration pursuant to this _Section 4_ if (i) a Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or (ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the Holders of any other equity securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such Registration, propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such other equity securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than $5,000,000.

 



 

5. **_Restrictions on Registration Rights_** **.** If (a) during the period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company-initiated Registration, the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2(a)_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become effective (to the extent not yet effective); (b) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly underwrite the offer; or (c) in the good faith judgment of the Board such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner more than once in any 12-month period.

 



      
 

 



 

6. **_General Procedures_** **.** If the Company is required to effect the Registration of Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect such Registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible:

 



 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a Registration
Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and
remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the
Prospectus, as may be requested by the Holders or any Underwriter of

instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the Registration
Statement effective until all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the
Prospectus;

 



 

(c) prior to filing a Registration Statement or prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any, and

each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement

Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration or the legal counsel for any such Holders may request in order to

Holders;

 



 

(d) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its reasonable

distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other Governmental Authorities as may be necessary by
virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be

service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
otherwise so subject;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities

Registration Statement;

 



 

(g) advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it shall
receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order
by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use
its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to
obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

 



 

(h) at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into such
Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to each seller of

(j) permit a representative of the Holders, the Underwriters, if any, and any

at each such Persons own expense, in the preparation of the Registration
Statement, and cause the Companys officers, directors and employees to supply
all information reasonably requested by any such representative, Underwriter,
attorney or accountant in connection with the Registration; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such representatives or Underwriters enter into a
confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such information;

 



 

(k) obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Companys independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold
comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and
reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating
Holders;

 



 

(l) on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to
such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel representing
the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to the Holders,
the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any,
covering such legal matters with respect to the Registration in respect of
which such opinion is being given as the Holders,

 



      
 

 



 

placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are
customarily included in such opinions, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority in interest of the participating Holders;

 



 

(m) in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with
the managing Underwriter of such offering;

 



 

(n) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable,

Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

 



 

(p) otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection
with such Registration.

 



 

7. **_Registration Expenses_** **.** The Registration Expenses of all Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration Expenses," all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

 



 

8. **_Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_** **.** No Person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

 



 

9. **_Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_** **.** Upon receipt of written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at any time would 

 



      
 

 



 

require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require the
inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to the Company for reasons beyond the Companys control, the
Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders,
delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such
Registration Statement for the shortest period of time, but in no event more
than thirty (30) days, determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary
for such purpose. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the
preceding sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their
receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating
to any Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders in writing of the
expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this
_Section 9._

 



 

10. **_Reporting Obligations_** **.** As long as any Holder shall own Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be reporting under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

connection with the operation of the business of such Holder or its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

Each of the financial statements referred to in _subparagraphs (i)_ , _(ii)_
and _(iii)_ above shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
the dates and for the periods stated therein, subject in the case of the
unaudited financial statements to changes resulting from normal year-end
adjustments for recurring accruals (none of which would, alone or in the
aggregate, be materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or

prospects or customer, supplier or employee relations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole).

 



 

(b) _Inspection Rights_ _._ The Company shall permit any representatives
designated by any Holder of Dow Registrable Securities, upon reasonable notice
and during normal business hours to (i) visit and inspect any of the

(d) _Subsidiary Boards_. Subject to applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement until the Expiration Date, at the request of TDCC, the Company shall
take all necessary action to cause the Preferred Director (or any person
designated by the Preferred Director) to be elected to the board of directors
(or similar governing body) of each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Sub
Board_ "). The Preferred Director (or its designee, if applicable) shall be
entitled to fees, other compensation and reimbursement of expenses paid to Sub
Board members who are not employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) _Board Committees_. Subject to applicable Law (including applicable Tax
regulations) and applicable stock exchange rules, from the date of this

any Governmental Authority that, by the terms of such Competition Law, require
the participation of TDCC in connection with such waiver, expiration or
termination of a waiting period, clearance, Consent or order (any such
requirement or action, a " _Filing Requirement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such reasonable cooperation shall not be deemed to include any

(other than as may be directly required pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Filing Requirement, such as filing fees), commence, defend or
participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial
or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Authority). TDCC
shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to convert
all or any portion of its Common Stock into Equity Interests of the Company,
the terms of which shall be identical in all respects to the Common Stock
except that, only for so long as such Equity Interests are held by TDCC or its
Subsidiaries, such Equity Interests shall have no right to vote on any matter
on which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote under the Charter. Upon
written notice from TDCC pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company shall convert such Common Stock as contemplated pursuant to this
_Section 11(f)_.

required by this _Section 12(a)(iv)_ shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of this _Section 12(a)(iv)_. No later than twenty-one (21) days
after the end of each of the Companys fiscal quarters, the Company will
deliver to TDCC the final form of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and
certifications thereof by the Companys principal executive and financial
officers in substantially the forms required under SEC rules for periodic
reports and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to TDCC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 12(a)(iv)_, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to file its quarterly report on
Form 10-Q with the SEC on the same date that TDCC files TDCCs quarterly
financial statements with the SEC unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or as otherwise reasonably agreed between the parties after due consideration
to, among other things, the securities Laws implications of filing on
different dates.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any time periods to the contrary in _Section 11(a)_,
while the provisions of this _Section 12_ are applicable, no later than
fourteen (14) days after the end of the Companys fiscal year, the Company
will deliver to TDCC the following (which may be preliminary):

 



 

A. (1) any financial and other information and data with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their business, properties, financial
position, results of operations and prospects as is reasonably requested by
TDCC in connection with the preparation of TDCCs financial statements and
annual report on Form 10-K and (2) a discussion and analysis by the Companys
management of the Company and its Subsidiaries financial condition and
results of operations for such year, including an explanation of any material
period-to-period change and any off-balance sheet transactions, all in
reasonable detail and prepared in accordance with Items 303(a) and 305 of
Regulation S-K; and

 



 

B. (1) drafts of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and notes thereto) for such year, setting forth in each case in
comparative form the consolidated figures (and notes thereto) for the previous
fiscal years and all in reasonable detail and prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-X and GAAP and (2) attestations of the Companys principal
executive and financial officers in substantially the forms required under SEC
rules for periodic reports and in form and substance

 



       
 

 



 

reasonably satisfactory to TDCC relating to such financial statements.

 



 

The information described in _(A)_ and _(B)_ above is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Annual Financial Statements_ " and a draft of the
Companys report on Form 10-K containing the information described in _(A)_
and _(B)_ above for such annual period that is delivered when required by
this _Section 12(a)(v)_ shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this
_Section 12(a)(v)_. The Company will deliver to TDCC all revisions to such
drafts as soon as any such revisions are prepared or made. No later than
thirty (30) days after the end of the Companys fiscal year, the Company will
deliver to TDCC the final form of its annual report on Form 10-K and
certifications thereof by the Companys principal executive and financial
officers in substantially the forms required under SEC rules for periodic
reports and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to TDCC, accompanied
by an opinion on the annual financial statements included therein by the
Companys independent certified public accountants. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 12(a)(v)_, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to file its Annual Financial Statements with the SEC
on the same date that TDCC files TDCCs Annual Financial Statements with the
SEC unless otherwise required by applicable Law or as otherwise reasonably
agreed between the parties after due consideration to, among other things, the
securities Law implications of filing on different dates.

 



 

(vi) With reasonable promptness, the Company and its Subsidiaries will deliver
to TDCC such additional audited and unaudited financial statements, financial
and other information and data with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their business, properties, financial positions, results of
operations and prospects as from time to time may be reasonably requested by
TDCC, including such financial information and comfort letters as may be
requested or required in connection with the sale or registration of
securities by TDCC.

 



 

(b) _Cooperation on TDCC Filings_.

 



 

(i) The Company will cooperate fully, and cause its auditors and other
Representatives to cooperate fully, with TDCC to the extent requested by TDCC
in the preparation of TDCCs public earnings or other press releases,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports to Stockholders, Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, any Current Reports on Form 8-K and any other proxy, information
and registration statements, reports, notices, prospectuses and any other
filings made by TDCC with the SEC, any national securities exchange or
otherwise made publicly available (collectively, the " _TDCC Public Filings_
").

 



 

(ii) The Company agrees to provide to TDCC all information that TDCC
reasonably requests in connection with any TDCC Public

 



      
 

 



 

Filings or that, in the judgment of TDCCs legal advisors, is required to be
disclosed or incorporated by reference therein under any Law. The Company will
provide such information in a timely manner on the dates requested by TDCC
(which may be earlier than the dates on which the Company otherwise would be
required hereunder to have such information available) to enable TDCC to
prepare, print and release all TDCC Public Filings on such dates as TDCC will
determine but in no event later than as required by applicable Law. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys auditors
and other Representatives to consent to any reference to them as experts in
any TDCC Public Filings required under any Law and to provide their consent to
the incorporation of their reports in TDCC Public Filings.

 



 

(iii) If and to the extent requested by TDCC, the Company diligently and
promptly will review all drafts of such TDCC Public Filings and prepare in a
diligent and timely fashion any portion of such TDCC Public Filing pertaining
to the Company.

 



 

(iv) Prior to any printing or public release of any TDCC Public Filing, an
appropriate executive officer of the Company will, if requested by TDCC,
certify that the information relating to any the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective businesses in such TDCC Public
Filing is accurate, true, complete and correct in all material respects.

 



 

(c) _Auditors and Audits; Annual Financial Statements and Accounting_.

 



 

(i) The Company and TDCC agree that [*] (or its affiliate accounting firms)
shall be engaged as promptly as practicable after the date hereof to serve as
the Companys (and the Companys Subsidiaries) independent certified public
accountants (the " _Company s Auditors_"), and the Company shall not select a
different accounting firm to serve as the Companys Auditors without TDCCs
prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld); provided that
nothing herein shall prevent a change in the Companys Auditors to the extent
that the Companys Board or its audit committee determines that a change is
reasonably necessary in order for the members thereof to comply with their
fiduciary duties.

 



 

(ii) The Company will provide to TDCC on a timely basis all information that
TDCC reasonably requires to meet its schedule for the preparation, printing,
filing, and public dissemination of the TDCC Annual Financial Statements in
accordance with _Sections 12(a)_ through _12(f)_ and as required by
applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
will provide

 



      
 

 



 

all required financial information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Companys Auditors in a sufficient and reasonable time and
in sufficient detail to permit the Companys Auditors to take all steps and
perform all reviews necessary to provide sufficient assistance to TDCCs
auditors with respect to information to be included or contained in the TDCC
Annual Financial Statements.

 



 

(iii) The Company will authorize the Companys Auditors to make available to
TDCCs auditors both the personnel who performed, or are performing, the
annual audit of the Company and work papers related to the annual audit of the
Company, in all cases within a reasonable time prior to the Companys
Auditors opinion date, so that TDCCs auditors are able to perform the
procedures they consider necessary to take responsibility for the work of the
Companys Auditors as it relates to TDCCs auditors report on TDCCs
statements, all within sufficient time to enable TDCC to meet its timetable
for the printing, filing and public dissemination of the TDCC Annual Financial
Statements.

 



 

(iv) If TDCC determines in good faith that there may be some inaccuracy in the
financial statements of the Company or any its Subsidiaries or deficiency in
such Persons internal accounting controls or operations that could materially
impact TDCCs financial statements, at TDCCs request, the Company will
provide TDCCs internal auditors or any public accounting firm or consultant
retained by TDCC with access to the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries so that TDCC may conduct reasonable audits relating to the
financial statements provided by the Company under this Agreement as well as
to the internal accounting controls and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) _Notice of Changes_ _._ Subject to _Section 11(a)_ and _Section 12(c)_,
the Company will give TDCC as much prior notice as reasonably practicable of
any proposed determination of, or any significant changes in, the Companys
accounting estimates or accounting principles with respect to the business
from those in effect with respect to the business as of immediately prior to
the Closing. The Company will consult with TDCC and, if requested by TDCC, the
Company will consult with TDCCs auditors with respect thereto. The Company
will not make any such determination or changes without TDCCs prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) if such a determination or a change
would be sufficiently material to be required to be disclosed in the Companys
or TDCCs financial statements as filed with the SEC or otherwise publicly
disclosed therein; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of the
Companys Board or its audit committee to make such a determination or change
to the extent it determines is reasonably necessary in order for its members
to comply with their fiduciary duties.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Special Reports of Deficiencies or Violations_ _. _The Company will
report in reasonable detail to TDCC the following events or circumstances
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after any executive
officer of the Company or any member of the Companys Board becomes aware of
such matter:

 



 

(i) all material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting that could materially
affect or are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information (including any
corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses);

 



 

(ii) any significant changes in the internal controls (or any other factors)
that are reasonably likely to materially affect the internal control over the
Companys financial reporting;

 



 

(iii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting;

 



 

(iv) any illegal act within the meaning of Section 10A(b) and (f) of the
Exchange Act;

 



 

(v) any internal control over financial reporting found to be ineffective,
flawed or deficient as of the end of the fiscal year; and

 



 

(vi) any report of a material violation of Law that an attorney representing
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries has formally made to any officers
or directors of the Company pursuant to the SECs attorney conduct rules (17
C.F.R. Part 205).

 



 

(f) _Applicability of Section 12_ _. _The provisions of this _Section 12_
shall apply during any and each period(s) in which TDCC and/or any Person
affiliated with TDCC (in TDCCs good faith determination) is required to
consolidate the results of operations and financial position of the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries or to account for its investment in the Company
under the equity method of accounting (determined in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with the SEC reporting requirements).

 



 

13. **_Lock-up Agreement_** **.**

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 13(b)_, during the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending on the first anniversary of the date hereof, no Holder shall
(i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant
any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of,
directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or
liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section
16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to any Registrable Securities or any
securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, any
Registrable Securities owned by such Person, (ii) enter into any swap or other
arrangement that

 



      
 

 



 

transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of any Registrable Securities or any securities convertible into, or
exercisable, or exchangeable for, Registrable Securities owned by such Person,
whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities,
in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any
transaction specified in _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_.

 



 

(b) If TDCC determines in good faith, in its sole discretion, that maintaining
the TDCC Ownership Percentage as of any date of determination would reasonably
be expected to require TDCC and/or any Person affiliated with TDCC to
consolidate the results of operations and financial position of the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries (determined in accordance with GAAP and
consistent with the SEC reporting requirements) (a " _Consolidation Risk_ "),
TDCC shall notify the Company in writing of such Consolidation Risk, the TDCC
Ownership Percentage that is, in TDCCs sole discretion, necessary to
remediate such Consolidation Risk, and its plan to remediate such
Consolidation Risk (a " _Consolidation Notice_ "). The Company shall have a
period of twenty (20) Business Days following the date of the Consolidation
Notice (such period, the " _Company Remediation Period_ ") to engage, with the
prior written consent of TDCC (not to be unreasonably withheld), in
transactions that would reduce the TDCC Ownership Percentage to a level that
remediates the Consolidation Risk. In the event that TDCC determines that the
Consolidation Risk remains following the Company Remediation Period,
notwithstanding _Section 13(a)_ and solely to the extent needed to remediate
the Consolidation Risk (as determined by TDCC, in its sole discretion), TDCC
shall have the right to (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell,
hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or
agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put
equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within
the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to any Registrable
Securities or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable
for, any Registrable Securities owned by such Person, (ii) enter into any swap
or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any Registrable Securities or any
securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Registrable
Securities owned by such Person, whether any such transaction is to be settled
by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly
announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in _clause (i)_ or
_(ii)_.

 



 

14. **_Indemnification_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by Law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each Person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused
by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their

 



      
 

 



 

officers and directors and each Person who controls such Underwriters (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the
foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

 



 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by Law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each Person who controls the Company
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly
for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation to indemnify
shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable
Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities
shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such
Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers, directors and each Person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

 



 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it
seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall
not impair any Persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such
failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless
in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between
such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such
claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified
by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the
reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist
between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Companys or such
Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

 



 

(e) If the indemnification provided under this _Section 14_ from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying partys and
indemnified partys relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _Section 14(e)_ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 14(a)_, _Section 14(b)_ and
_Section 14(c)_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _Section 14(e)_ were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in this _Section 14(e)_. No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to
this _Section 14(e)_ from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

15. **_Other Arrangements_** ** _._** The Company represents and warrants that no Person, other than a Holder of Registrable Securities, has any right to require the Company to register any securities of the Company for sale or to include such securities of the Company in any Registration filed by the Company for the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of any other Person. Further, the Company represents and warrants that this Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. The Company and the Founding Holders hereby terminate the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of February 12, 2014 by and among the Company and the Founding Holders and any similar agreement, as of the date hereof. The Company shall not hereafter enter into any agreement with respect to its securities which is

 



      
 

 



 

inconsistent with or violates the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable
Securities in this Agreement.

 



 

16. **_Miscellaneous_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Remedies_ _._ Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that, in the event
of any non-performance or breach of this Agreement, the non-performing or non-
breaching party, as the case may be would be immediately and irreparably
harmed by such non-performance or breach and could not be made whole by
monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that, with respect to any such non-
performance or breach, each party hereto (a) shall waive, in any action for
equitable relief (including specific performance, injunctive relief and any
other equitable remedy), the defense of adequate remedy at law and (b) shall,
in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party hereto may be
entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages), be entitled to
equitable relief (including the compelling of specific performance of this
Agreement, injunctive relief and any other equitable remedy) with no
obligation to prove actual damages or post any bond in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) _Amendments and Waivers_ _._ The failure of a party hereto at any time or
times to require performance of any provision hereof or claim damages with
respect thereto shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce
the same. Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this
Agreement may be amended or waived only upon the prior written consent of the
Company and Holders of a majority of Dow Registrable Securities; _provided_
that if any such amendment or waiver would adversely affect in any material
manner the rights of any Holders of Registrable Securities relative to other
Holders of Registrable Securities similarly situated with respect to such
rights under this Agreement, such amendment or waiver must be approved in
writing by the Holders of a majority of such Registrable Securities so
adversely affected.

 



 

(c) _Successors and Assigns_ _._ All covenants and agreements in this
Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and inure to
the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto
whether so expressed or not. In addition, whether or not any express
assignment has been made, the provisions of this Agreement which are for the
benefit of purchasers or Holders of Registrable Securities are also for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, any subsequent Holder of Registrable
Securities.

 



 

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly set forth herein, this
Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and, to the extent provided herein, their
respective affiliates, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Severability_ _._ If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the

 



      
 

 



 

provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable provision as similar as
possible to the provision at issue.

 



 

(f) _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by .pdf file exchanged via email or other electronic
transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

(g) _Other Definitional Provisions and Interpretation_. The headings preceding
the text of Articles and Sections included in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be deemed part of this Agreement or be given
any effect in interpreting this Agreement. The use of the masculine, feminine
or neuter gender or the singular or plural form of words herein shall not
limit any provision of this Agreement. The meaning assigned to each term
defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and the plural
forms of such term. The use of "including" or "include" shall in all cases
herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include, without limitation,"
respectively. The use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly
indicated otherwise. Reference to any Person includes such Persons successors
and assigns to the extent such successors and assigns are permitted by the
terms of any applicable agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular
capacity excludes such Person in any other capacity or individually. Reference
to any agreement (including this Agreement), document or instrument shall mean
such agreement, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the
terms hereof. Underscored references to Articles, Sections or clauses shall
refer to those portions of this Agreement. The use of the terms "hereunder,"
"hereof," "hereto" and words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section, paragraph or clause of
this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement have the defined meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto, unless otherwise defined.

 



 

(h) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by and
construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

 



 

(i) _Notices_ _._ Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been given, (a) when received if given in person or by courier or a
courier service or (b) on the date of transmission if sent by facsimile
transmission (receipt confirmed) on a Business Day during or before the normal
business hours of the intended recipient, and if not so sent on such a day and
at such a time, on the following Business Day. Such notices, demands and other
communications shall be sent to the Company, TDCC and each Founding Holder at
the address indicated on the signature pages hereto or to such other address
or to the attention of such other Person as the recipient party has specified
by prior written notice to the sending party.

Date (as hereinafter defined) has occurred in respect of any Grantees
Premises (the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 



 

(b) The Term with respect to each Grantees Premises shall commence on the
Commencement Date and expire on the earlier of (i) the term as set forth for
such Grantees Premises in _Schedule A_ ; (ii) in the case of any Grantees

_Section 3(c)_, _Section 3(d)_, _Section 3(e)_, or 3(f) (in each instance,
the " _Premises Expiration Date_ ").

 



 

(c) With respect to any Leased Premises, if at any time subsequent to the
Commencement Date, the owner or landlord, as applicable, of the Building
notifies the applicable Grantor that its consent for the occupancy by the
Grantee is required, then the applicable Grantor shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent. In the event that such consent is
not obtained and as a result thereof the Grantees right to occupy its
Premises is terminated, the Grantee shall vacate as soon as reasonably
practicable at its sole cost and expense.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Grantee
wishes to terminate its right to use and occupy its Premises, such Grantee may
terminate such right, and the applicable Companion Agreement, upon not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the applicable Grantor.

to the applicable Grantee.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, TDCC or the
applicable Grantor may terminate this Agreement and any Companion Agreement,
effective immediately, if the applicable Grantee fails to pay Rent or any
other sums due hereunder within thirty (30) days of the date on which such
amounts become due and payable hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Upon the termination or discontinuance of use by any Grantee of any
Premises under any circumstances in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, such Grantee shall provide an acknowledgement of termination with
respect to each such Premises to be executed by the applicable Grantor and
delivered to such Grantee within a reasonable period of time.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Grantee may not
terminate its obligation with respect to _Section 12_ hereof.

 



 

4. **_Condition of Premises_** **.**

 



 

Purchaser agrees that it enters into this Agreement, and each Grantee enters
into the applicable Companion Agreement, without any representations,
warranties or statements by TDCC or any Grantor, their agents,
representatives, employees, servants, brokers or any other Person as to the
present or future condition of any Grantees Premises or the use that may be
made of such Grantees Premises or any improvements thereon, except as
specifically contained in this Agreement and/or the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Each Grantor shall deliver the applicable Grantees Premises to such Grantee
and such Grantee shall accept such Grantees Premises from such Grantor in its
"AS IS" condition, and such Grantor shall have no obligation to improve or
alter such Grantees Premises for such Grantees occupancy. No Grantor shall
have any liability pursuant to this Agreement by reason of the condition of
such Grantors Premises, the applicable Grantees Premises, or the applicable
Building, including any defect or any limitation on its use, except to the
extent it is specifically contained in this Agreement. Prior to any Grantees
occupancy of its Premises, such Grantee shall provide a certification to the
applicable Grantor executed by Grantee (i) certifying that such Grantee
accepts its Premises as clean pursuant to best commercial practices for the
Business and suitable for all use intended or exercised by such Grantee and
(ii) releasing the applicable Grantors landlord from any obligation and
liability associated with the cleanliness and suitability of the use of
Grantees Premises by such Grantee.

 



 

5. **_Rent_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Rent_. Each Grantee shall pay to the applicable Grantor, without any
prior demand therefor and without any deduction or set-off whatsoever, the
fixed rent for such Grantees Premises as specified in _Schedule A_ (" _Rent"_
) by wire transfer of funds to such Grantors account, as designated by such
Grantor. Rent for each of the Grantees Premises shall be due and payable in
monthly installments in advance on the first day of each and every calendar
month during the Term with respect to each such Grantees Premises.

 



 

(b) _Past Due Rent_. If a Grantee shall fail to pay any installment of Rent
before the fifteenth day after such Rent is due and payable, such Grantee
shall pay a charge (the " _Late Charge_ ") which shall be 5% of the amount of
such unpaid installment of Rent. The parties hereto agree that the amount of
such Late Charge represents a reasonable estimate of the cost and expense that
will be incurred by a Grantor in processing each delinquent payment of Rent by
a Grantee and that such Late Charge shall be paid to Grantor as liquidated
damages for each delinquent payment. Any amount due from a Grantee to a
Grantor which is not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate equal at all
times to the prime rate of interest as published in _The Wall_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ , from time to time, plus 5%, but in no
case higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law, after the
expiration of any applicable grace period, on the unpaid amount from the due
date until the date paid. The rate so determined shall continue in effect
following any default by a Grantee pursuant to this Agreement. Payment of such
interest shall not excuse or cure any default by a Grantee under this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the payment of interest and the
payment of Late Charges provided for in this _Section 5(b)_ are distinct and
separate from one another in that the payment of interest is to compensate
such Grantor for its inability to use the money improperly withheld by such
Grantee, while the payment of Late Charges is to compensate such Grantor for
its additional administrative expenses in handling and processing delinquent
payments.

 



 

(c) Each Grantee shall pay Rent, without any set-off, counterclaim, abatement
or deduction whatsoever, except as may be expressly set forth in this
Agreement, in U.S. dollars and in accordance with _Section 5(a)_. Rent for
any partial month including upon expiration or termination of the Agreement
shall be prorated for a per diem charge to reflect only the portion of the
month for which this Agreement is in effect. Any failure or delay by a Grantor
in billing any Rent amount shall not constitute a waiver of the applicable
Grantees obligations to pay the same in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Each Grantee shall reimburse the applicable Grantor promptly upon
demand for any additional rent or late fees incurred by such Grantor solely by
reason of such Grantees failure to remit any payments of Rent to such Grantor
in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(d) Grantees obligation to pay the applicable Rent and all other sums payable
under this _Section 5_ shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of
this Agreement in respect of any period prior to such expiration or earlier
termination.

 



 

6. **_Permitted Use_** **.**

 



 

Grantees Premises shall be used and occupied only for use consistent with its
current use as operated and used in connection with the Business (" _Current
Use_ ").

 



 

7. **_Grantee s Insurance_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Grantee shall procure and maintain, at its own cost and expense,
comprehensive general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance and
any additional insurance required under applicable Law, including such
insurance as the applicable Grantor is required to carry for its use at its
Premises. All such insurance (except the workers compensation insurance)
shall be endorsed to name the applicable Grantor, as well as any other Person
required pursuant to agreements of such Grantor with independent third
parties, as additional insured parties.

 



 

(b) Each Grantee shall undertake that all insurance policies to be procured
and maintained under the provisions of this Agreement shall be endorsed to
provide that (i) insurers waive their rights of subrogation against the
applicable Grantor and any other Person required pursuant to the agreements of
such Grantor with independent third parties with respect to losses payable
under such policy or policies, (ii) the policies may be cancelled or
materially altered or reduced in coverage (except as otherwise permitted under
the terms of this Agreement) by the

 



      
 

 



 

insurer only after thirty (30) days prior written notice to such Grantee, and
the insurer will give written notice to such Grantee in the event of
nonpayment of premium by such Grantee when due. The policies of insurance
required under this _Section 7_ shall not be invalidated against a Grantor by
reason of any violation of a condition or breach of warranty of the policies
or the application therefore by the applicable Grantee. Each Grantee shall
undertake that all such policies shall be issued by insurers of recognized
responsibility and where applicable shall provide coverage with respect to
incidents occurring anywhere in the jurisdiction in which each of such
Grantees Premises is situated. All such insurance companies shall be rated in
A.M. Bests Insurance Guide or any successor thereto (or an organization
having a similar national reputation) or other insurer reasonably acceptable
to the applicable Grantor, which may include a captive insurer owned or
controlled by either party and shall have (save in respect of any such captive
insurer) a rating of at least "A-" with a "Financial Size Category" of at
least "VIII" in Bests Insurance Guide (or other comparable rating for a
rating by an organization other than A.M. Best). In the event that any of the
liability insurance policies maintained by a Grantee shall now or hereafter
provide coverage on a "claims-made" basis, such Grantee shall continue to
maintain such policies in effect for a period of not less than three (3) years
after the expiration of this Agreement. Upon the execution of this Agreement
and thereafter not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of
any expiring policies required under this _Section 7_, each Grantee shall
furnish the applicable Grantor with certificates of the insurance coverage
required by this _Section 7_.

 



 

8. **_Assignment_** **.**

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall not, and no Grantee shall, voluntarily or involuntarily,
by operation of Law or otherwise, assign, mortgage, pledge, encumber, or
transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or estates hereunder, sublet any
of its Premises or any part thereof, or suffer or permit any Premises, or any
part thereof, to be used or occupied by others, without the prior written
consent of TDCC and the applicable Grantor, which may be withheld in their
sole discretion. A change of control of Purchaser or any Grantee, including
any transfer of stock or other ownership interest in Purchaser or such
Grantee, merger, consolidation, or any other corporate reorganization of
Purchaser or such Grantee shall be an assignment under this Agreement and

requirement of obtaining TDCCs and the applicable Grantors prior written
consent.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 8(a)_, Purchaser or any Grantee may assign,
transfer or convey all of its rights and interests in this Agreement, or in
any of its Premises or portions thereof, to an Affiliate of Purchaser or of
such Grantee without TDCCs or the applicable Grantors consent, but upon not
less than five (5) days prior written notice to TDCC and to the applicable
Grantor.

 



 

(c) This Agreement may be assigned by TDCC or any Grantor to any third party
without the consent of Purchaser or any Grantee in connection with a sale,
transfer, conveyance, disposition, divestiture, contribution to a joint
venture or a similar transaction, including by merger, consolidation,
reorganization, or other business combination, by TDCC or Grantor of all or
substantially all of any Grantees Premises or any individual or any portion
of Grantees Premises, in which case TDCC or such Grantor, as applicable may
only assign such rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement as may be
connected with such portion of

 



       
 

 



 

Grantees Premises. Upon the assignment of this Agreement and the express
assumption by the assignee of the assigned obligations of TDCC or any Grantor
under this Agreement through the execution of an assignment and assumption
agreement, TDCC and such Grantor shall be automatically, fully and
unconditionally released from all obligations and liabilities under this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed in any way or for any purpose to
create any form of partnership or to impose any tortious or fiduciary duty on
any party hereto and no party hereto shall have the power, authority or right
to assume or impose any obligations or liability on behalf of any other party
hereto without the prior written approval of such party.

 



 

9. **_Premises Condition and Compliance_** **.**

Notwithstanding the aforesaid, no Grantee shall be obligated to carry out any
improvements to its Premises, to put its Premises in any better state of
repair and condition than they are in as of the date hereof and each Grantee
shall maintain and operate its Premises in the same manner as it had been
maintained and operated immediately prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Each Grantee shall, at its own expense, comply with all laws, ordinances,
orders, rules, regulations policies or procedures (i) of all Governmental
Authorities, (ii) pursuant to applicable Law, (iii) of all insurance bodies
and their fire prevention engineers at any time in force, (iv) promulgated by
the owner or landlord of any Leased Premises with respect to the maintenance,
use and operation of the applicable Grantees Premises, which may be amended
by the owner or landlord from time to time and (v) promulgated by the
applicable Grantor with respect to the maintenance, use and operation of the
applicable Grantees Premises, including any office and laboratory space
within each Grantees Premises (items (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v),
collectively, " _Rules and Regulations_") during the Term of this Agreement.
Each Grantor shall provide the applicable Grantee with a written copy of the
applicable building, office and laboratory space procedures and policies.

 



 

(c) Each Grantor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
owner or landlord, as applicable, of the Building continues to comply with and
fulfill its obligations with respect to the maintenance and operation of the
Building and any property of which the Building forms a part.

 



 

(d) Each Grantor shall continue to maintain and operate its Premises in a
substantially similar manner as it has prior to the date hereof, including
compliance with all applicable Laws and Rules and Regulations. In addition,

Grantees Premises (" _Alterations_ ") without first obtaining the applicable
Grantors prior written consent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.
If Alterations by a Grantee are consented to as aforesaid, such Grantee shall
comply with all applicable Law and Rules and Regulations in connection with
the performance of any Alterations and shall take such measures as may be
reasonably required to minimize interference with or disturbance of the
Grantor, or other tenants and occupants in the Building in making such
Alterations. In addition, each Grantee shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the applicable Grantor and its Affiliates against liability, loss,
cost, damage, liens and expenses imposed on such Grantor or its Affiliates
arising out of performance of or incurred in connection with Alterations made
by such Grantee.

 



 

(b) Each Grantor further reserves the right to renovate any Grantees Premises
at such time that such Grantor is renovating all or a part of the applicable
Grantors Premises that includes such Grantees Premises. In exercising such
right, each Grantor shall use reasonable efforts to perform the renovations in
a manner which minimizes interference with the conduct of the applicable
Grantees business in such Grantees Premises.

 



 

11. **_Surrender_** **.**

 



 

Upon the expiration of this Agreement, upon the earlier termination of this
Agreement in its entirety with respect to each Grantees Premises or upon the
applicable Premises Expiration Date, such Grantee shall at once surrender and
deliver the applicable Grantees Premises, together with all improvements
thereon, to the applicable Grantor in no worse condition than as of the date
hereof, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, as between any Grantor and any Grantee, (i) such Grantee shall not
be required to remove any alterations performed by such Grantor prior to the
Commencement Date or to restore such Grantees Premises to their condition
prior to the making of such alterations, and (ii) no Grantee shall be required
to surrender any items of Trade Property (as defined below) which shall remain
the property of such Grantee whether or not affixed to such Grantees
Premises, provided the same shall be removed from such Grantees Premises in

repair any damage to its Premises which may result from such removal. If such
Grantee does not remove its Trade Property from its Premises upon the
expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement with respect to its
Premises or upon the applicable Premises Expiration Date, the applicable
Grantor may, at its option: (i) remove the same (and repair any damage
occasioned thereby as aforesaid) and dispose thereof, and such Grantee shall
pay the cost of such removal, repair and restoration, if any, to such Grantor
within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoice or (ii) choose to retain the

provisions, covenants or agreements of this Agreement, for a period of five
(5) days; or

 



 

(ii) a non-monetary default, for a period of ten (10) days, which reasonably
could:

relevant third party agreement in respect of the applicable Grantees
Premises,

 



 

D. materially disturb or interfere with such Grantors use and business
operations at its Premises, or

 



 

E. negatively affect the permits and or authorizations held by such Grantor,
which affect its Premises.

 



 

14. **_Consents_** **.**

 



 

All references in this Agreement to the consent or approval of a Grantor or a
Grantee shall be deemed to mean the written consent or approval of such
Grantor or Grantee (as appropriate) and no consent or approval of such Grantor
or Grantee shall be effective for any purpose unless such consent or approval
is set forth in a written instrument executed by such Grantor or Grantee (as
appropriate).

 



 

15. **_Covenants and Indemnity_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Grantor and Grantee agree to perform and to observe all of their
obligations, covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions under
this Agreement. Grantee shall take any action, other than merely occupying its
Premises and using it in accordance with the Current Use. Each Grantor and
Grantee shall refrain from any action, which would (i) constitute or cause the
applicable Grantor to be in default under, or breach any relevant third party
agreement, (ii) cause the rights of such Grantor to its Premises and the
rights of such Grantee to its Premises to be cancelled, terminated or
forfeited, (iii) cause a party hereto to become liable for damages, costs,
claims or penalties, (iv) adversely affect, reduce, disturb or

 



      
 

 



 

interfere with the use and business operations of a party hereto or (v) cause
damage in the common areas in or relating to any of such Grantors Premises or
of any Building.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and each Grantee shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend
and hold TDCC and each Grantor and their directors, officers, agents,
employees and representatives, harmless of, from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, suits, penalties, claims, demands, actual and
reasonable costs and expenses, of every kind or nature, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses of defending and enforcing this indemnity,
whether actual or potential, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
contingent or non-contingent, whether concealed or hidden, upon any theory of
law or equity, based upon past or future events, now existing or coming into
existence in the future (" _Claims_ "), by reason of any Grantees failure to
comply in any material respect with any obligation, covenant or agreement set
forth herein or arising from the use, occupancy or manner of use and/or
occupancy of such Grantees Premises or of any business conducted therein, or
from any work or thing whatsoever done, or any condition created by or any
other act or omission of such Grantee, its assignees, or their respective
employees, agents, servants, contractors, invitees, visitors or licensees, in
or about such Grantees Premises or any part of the Building or the applicable
Grantors Premises.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section
15_ shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement or
the applicable Premises Expiration Date with respect to each of the Premises.

 



 

16. **_Access Rights_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Grantor reserves the right of access to its risers, conduits, cables,
installations and equipment located within the applicable Grantees Premises
to which access will be required by such Grantor from time to time to assure
the continued functioning of electric, electronic, ventilation, water,
drainage and other similar systems in such Grantors Premises in the Building.
During the Term of this Agreement, any Grantor may enter the applicable
Grantees Premises from time to time for purposes of inspecting, repairing or
replacing such risers, conduits, cables, installations and equipment. In
exercising such right, such Grantor shall take such measures as may be
reasonably required to minimize interference with the conduct of such
Grantees business in its Premises.

 



 

(b) Each Grantor and Grantee grant to the other party during the Term of this
Agreement, the rights to enter or pass through each of their respective
premises within the applicable Building for the sole purposes of ingress to
and egress from their premises and/or common areas of such Grantors Premises
or the Building, as appropriate, and consistent with the manner of ingress and
egress exercised prior to the date hereof. To the extent any Grantor has other
access rights over property owned by a third party to access its Premises
pursuant to third party agreements, such Grantor grants to the applicable
Grantee such equivalent rights for the sole purpose of ingress to or egress
from the Building as reasonably necessary to conduct its business and
consistent with such conduct immediately prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(c) In exercising the rights under this _Section 16_, each party shall use
reasonable efforts to minimize interference with the use by a party hereto of
its premises and

 



      
 

 



 

promptly repair any damage caused to the premises or personal property of
another party hereto caused by such access.

 



 

17. **_Quiet Enjoyment_** **.**

 



 

Provided any Grantee is in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, such
Grantee shall enjoy the peaceful and quiet use, possession and enjoyment of
its Premises without hindrance or disturbance by any Grantor or any Persons
claiming by, through or under such Grantor except as expressly permitted by
the terms hereof or by applicable Law.

 



 

18. **_Confidentiality_** **.**

 



 

(a) The term "Confidential Information" shall include any and all information,
know-how and data of a party hereto (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), its
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, representatives (including
financial advisors, attorneys and accountants), third-party contractors or
agents (with respect to each party hereto, its " _Representatives_ ") made
available or disclosed, directly or indirectly, to another party hereto (the "
_Receiving Party_ ") or its Representatives in connection with this Agreement,
regardless of the manner or form in which it is furnished, whether furnished
before, on or after the date of this Agreement, including, (i) this Agreement
(including, its terms and information disclosed during the negotiation of this
Agreement); (ii) information relating to facilities, trade secrets, processes,
patent applications, product development, pricing, customers or sales,
customer and supplier lists, policies and strategies, client and consultant
contracts, operations, methods, business plans or opportunities, business
performance, business acquisition plans, personnel matters, finances; (iii)
all other confidential or proprietary information disclosed in connection with
this Agreement; and (iv) all notes, analyses, compilations, studies,
forecasts, interpretations, summaries, data and other documents and materials
in whatever form maintained, whether prepared by the Receiving Party, its
Representatives or others, which contain or reflect, or are derived from, any
of the information described in clauses (i) through (iii) above.

 



 

(b) The term "Confidential Information" does not include information, that (i)
is published or otherwise becomes part of the public domain other than as a
result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in
violation of this Agreement or other obligation of confidentiality (but only
after, and only to the extent that, it is published or otherwise becomes part
of the public domain); (ii) the Receiving Party can prove was in its or its
Representatives possession; provided, that such information is not subject to
a legal, fiduciary or contractual obligation of confidentiality or secrecy to
the Disclosing Party or any other Person; (iii) the Receiving Party can prove
was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to
Confidential Information; or (iv) the Receiving Party can prove became
available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a Person
other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives; provided, that such
Person is not bound by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality or secrecy to the Disclosing Party or any other Person. For
the purpose of this _paragraph (b)_ , specific information, such as operating
procedures and equipment for producing or processing specific materials, shall
not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is
embraced by more general information in the public domain and any combination
of features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely

 



      
 

 



 

because individual features are separately in the public domain, unless the
combination itself, and its principle of operation, are in the public domain.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, each Receiving Party shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, (i) treat and maintain Confidential Information
of the Disclosing Party as confidential; (ii) not disclose Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party; (iii) use Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party only for the purposes of exercising rights
or fulfilling obligations under this Agreement or as authorized in writing by
the Disclosing Party; and (iv) not include Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party in any patent, patent application or other public document.
The obligations set forth in the preceding sentence shall expire or terminate
five (5) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any
breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such expiration or termination.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party hereto may (i) disclose
Confidential Information to its Representatives; (ii) disclose Confidential
Information to the other partys Representatives; and (iii) receive
Confidential Information of the other party through its Representatives, in
each case, to the extent (x) reasonably necessary for the performance of this
Agreement; and (y) its Representatives agree to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement as if they were parties hereto. Each party hereto shall be
responsible for any failure of its Representatives to comply with the terms of
this _Section 18_ and agrees to take, at its sole expense, all reasonable
measures (including court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from
prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the other partys Confidential
Information.

 



 

(e) In the event that a Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is
required by Law to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law, notify the
Disclosing Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a
request, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order
or other remedy or waive its compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and,
if the Disclosing Party seeks such an order, the Receiving Party shall provide
such cooperation as the Disclosing Party may reasonably request). In the event
that such protective order or other remedy is denied, or the Disclosing Party
waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, and
the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are nonetheless legally
compelled to disclose such information, the Receiving Party or its
Representatives, as the case may be, shall furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that is legally required, and the Receiving Party
shall exercise its reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of
the remainder of the Confidential Information. A disclosure that is required
to obtain or maintain operating permits or to meet recording and reporting
requirements or to properly report and pay taxes shall be considered required
by Law under this _paragraph (e)_. A disclosure that is required only to
obtain patents or other intellectual property protection shall not be
considered required by Law under this _paragraph (e)_.

 



 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto would be
irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this _Section 18_ are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached
and that any non-performance or breach of this _Section 18_ by any party
hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages

 



      
 

 



 

alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party
hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary damages), such
party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this _Section 18_ by a
decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the
provisions of this _Section 18_ without posting any bond or other
undertaking. The parties hereto agree that they will not contest the
appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

 



 

(g) _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, NO PARTY HERETO OR ANY
OF ITS RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF ITS
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

 



 

19. **_Holding Over_** **.**

 



 

No Grantee shall have any right to occupy its Premises or any portion thereof
after the expiration of this Agreement, after the earlier termination of this
Agreement or of such Grantees right to possession in consequence of an Event
of Default hereunder or upon the applicable Premises Expiration Date. In the
event any Grantee or any party claiming by, through or under such Grantee
holds over, the applicable Grantor may exercise any and all remedies available
to it at law or in equity to recover possession of such Grantees Premises,
and to recover damages. For each and every month or partial month that any
Grantee or any party claiming by, through or under such Grantee remains in
occupancy of all or any portion of such Grantees Premises after the
expiration of this Agreement or after termination of this Agreement or such
Grantees right to possession, such Grantee shall pay, as minimum damages and
not as a penalty, monthly rental at a rate equal to double the rate of Rent
payable by such Grantee hereunder immediately prior to the expiration or other
termination of this Agreement or of such Grantees right to possession. The
acceptance by any Grantor of any lesser sum shall be construed as payment on
account and not in satisfaction of damages for such holding over. In addition,
not withstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Grantee and
Purchaser shall indemnify the applicable Grantor and TDCC against any losses,
costs and expenses incurred by such Grantor and/ or TDCC arising from claims
by third parties as the result of any Grantee holdover.

 



 

20. **_Successors in Title_** **.**

 



 

Subject to _Section 8_ and _Section 3(b)_, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of successors in title by operation of Law to
the whole or substantially the whole of the business of the parties hereto and
to their permitted assignees and transferees of the rights and obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 

21. **_Amendment_** **.**

 



 

Except by the execution of a Companion Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof, this Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented (a) by an
instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the parties hereto that
expressly references the section of this Agreement to be amended; or (b) by a
waiver in accordance with _Section 31_.

 



       
 

 



 

22. **_Severability_** **.**

 



 

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be deemed
substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

SECTION 2. _Overlap_. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the terms of the Purchase Agreement with respect to Taxes, the
terms of this Agreement shall govern.

 



 

SECTION 3. _Filing of Tax Returns; Cooperation; Contest_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser and AgroFresh shall permit TDCC to review and comment on
each Tax Return of AgroFresh and its Affiliates to the extent that such Tax
Return involves (i) treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement, (ii) the basis of any AgroFresh Asset,
(iii) the eligibility of any AgroFresh Asset for depreciation or amortization,
(iv) the amount or timing of any deduction for depreciation or amortization
relating to any AgroFresh Asset or (v) the gain or loss recognized by
Purchaser, AgroFresh or any Affiliate thereof arising from the transfer, sale
or other disposition of any AgroFresh Asset (collectively, the " _Covered
Matters_ "). Purchaser shall submit each such Tax Return to TDCC no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return
(taking into account any valid extensions) and shall make all changes
reasonably requested by TDCC with respect to any such Covered Matters (except
to the extent of any position for which substantial authority does not exist
within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall or shall cause
AgroFresh and its Affiliates to elect or report, as applicable, for U.S.
federal, state or local income tax purposes, the cost recovery, depreciation
or amortization method, as the case may be, with respect to each AgroFresh
Asset that would allow for the earliest possible recovery of the Redetermined
Tax Basis (except to the extent of any position for which substantial
authority does not exist within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder).

 



 

(b) In the event of any audit, Proceeding or other claim for Taxes with
respect to a Tax Return that relates to, or could have any effect on, the
Covered Matters (a " _Contest_ "), Purchaser shall timely notify TDCC of such
Contest and TDCC shall have the exclusive right, in its sole discretion and at
its own expense, to control, resolve, compromise, settle or agree to any
deficiency, claim or adjustment arising out of such Contest, except to the
extent that any such Contest, in Purchasers reasonable opinion, cannot be
dealt with separately from any matter that is not a Covered Matter, and
subject, in all instances, to the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If TDCC does not elect
to so control any such Contest, Purchaser shall keep TDCC reasonably informed
of all material developments with respect to such Contest and shall not
settle, compromise or otherwise resolve such Contest without TDCCs prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 



 

(c) TDCC and Purchaser shall each cooperate fully (and each shall cause its
respective Affiliates to cooperate fully) with all reasonable requests from
the other Party in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any Contest, the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
relating to the Covered Matters and any calculation or determination
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Allocation Schedule and
determinations of Hypothetical Tax Liability, Actual Tax Liability, Stand-
Alone Hypothetical Tax Liability and Stand-Alone Actual Tax Liability). Such
cooperation shall include at each Partys own expense, (i) the retention until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including applicable
extensions), and the provision upon request, of Tax Returns, books, records,
documentation and other information relating to Tax Returns and/or the
calculations and determinations contemplated under this Agreement and (ii) the
execution of any document that may be necessary or reasonably helpful in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return or control of any Contest,
including, but not limited to, the execution by Purchaser and any Affiliate of
Purchaser of a power of attorney authorizing TDCC and its accountants, tax
advisors and other representatives to represent Purchaser and/or any Affiliate
of Purchaser with respect to any matter described in this _Section 3_. Each
Party shall make its employees and facilities available on a reasonable basis
in connection with the foregoing matters. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Purchaser shall not be entitled to obtain any information
relating to Taxes of TDCC or any of its Affiliates other than information
relating solely to any of the AgroFresh Entities.

 



 

SECTION 4. _Preparation of Allocation Schedule_.

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the date on which Final Closing Working
Capital is determined, TDCC shall deliver to Purchaser a schedule (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") setting forth (i) the Tax basis of each AgroFresh
Asset or AgroFresh Asset Class as recorded on AgroFreshs Tax books and
records as of the Closing Date (the " _Beginning Basis_ "), (ii) the
allocation of the Purchase Price and any other amounts constituting
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes (collectively, the "
_Consideration_ ") among the assets of AgroFresh as of the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 338 and Section 1060 of the Code (the " _Redetermined
Tax Basis_ ") and (iii) with respect to each AgroFresh Asset or AgroFresh
Asset Class, the excess, if any, of the Redetermined Tax Basis over the
Beginning Basis (the " _Basis Adjustment_ ").

 



 

(b) If within ten (10) days after receipt of the Allocation Schedule,
Purchaser notifies TDCC in writing that Purchaser objects to one or more items
reflected on the Allocation Schedule (the " _Unresolved Allocation_ "), then
Purchaser and TDCC shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If
TDCC and Purchaser fail to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days
after TDCCs receipt of Purchasers notice (or such longer period as the
Parties may mutually agree in writing), then, at the request of either TDCC or
Purchaser, the Parties shall submit the Unresolved Allocation for arbitration,
in accordance with Section 338 and Section 1060 of the Code, to Grant Thornton
LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ "); _provided_ , that in the event that Grant
Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Parties
shall mutually agree in writing to appoint a nationally recognized firm with
accounting expertise and relevant experiences in resolving similar disputes to
serve as the "Accounting Firm" hereunder. The scope of the review by the
Accounting Firm shall be limited to a disposition of the Unresolved Allocation
(including all items and amounts that were previously accepted or agreed upon
or deemed agreed upon by the Parties). The Accounting Firm is not to, and the
parties shall not individually request the Accounting Firm to, (A) make any
determination other than as set forth in the previous sentence, (B) determine
any Unresolved Allocation to be a value higher

 



      
 

 



 

than the highest value or lower than the lowest value proposed by the Parties
in their submissions to the Accounting Firm or (C) undertake any independent
investigation of the facts relating to the Unresolved Allocation. TDCC and
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
render its written decision resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly
as practicable and, if at all possible, within thirty (30) days after such
submission of the Allocation Schedule. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 4(b)_ (and
pursuant to _Sections 5(c)_ , _7(b)_ and _7(d)_ of this Agreement) shall be
borne one half by Purchaser and one half by TDCC. All other fees, expenses and
costs incurred by TDCC or Purchaser in implementing the provisions of this
_Section 4(b)_ shall be borne by TDCC or Purchaser, respectively.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the payment of any amount
pursuant to this Agreement, TDCC shall deliver to Purchaser an amended
Allocation Schedule that takes into account the amount of such payment (other
than Imputed Interest) as an adjustment to the Consideration and sets forth
the revised computation of the Redetermined Tax Basis and Basis Adjustment of
each AgroFresh Asset or AgroFresh Asset Class. If within ten (10) days after
receipt of the amended Allocation Schedule, Purchaser notifies TDCC in writing
that Purchaser objects to one or more items reflected on the amended
Allocation Schedule, such dispute shall be treated as an Unresolved Allocation
subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 4(b)_.

 



 

(d) Absent a Final Determination to the contrary, the Parties shall file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule, and shall not take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any position
inconsistent therewith for Tax reporting purposes or in any Contest. Any
adjustment to the Consideration (including any Deferred Payment Amount) shall
be allocated as provided by U.S. Department of Treasury Regulation
§1.1060-1(c).

 



 

SECTION 5. _Tax Benefit Payments_.

 



 

(a) The provisions of this _Section 5_ shall be effective for an AgroFresh
Asset Class only in the event that the aggregate Redetermined Tax Basis for
such AgroFresh Asset Class exceeds the aggregate Beginning Basis for such
AgroFresh Asset Class.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) days following the date on which Purchaser, AgroFresh or
any Affiliate thereof actually files its United States federal income tax
return or any state income tax return, as applicable, that includes the
Business for any Covered Taxable Year, Purchaser shall submit to TDCC a
preliminary determination (the " _Preliminary Determination_ ") of (A) the
liability for Taxes that would be due on such date assuming the same facts and
using the same methods, elections, conventions and practices used in
determining the actual liability for Taxes for such Covered Taxable Year;
provided, however, that such liability shall be calculated (i) with reference
to the Beginning Basis instead of the Redetermined Tax Basis of each AgroFresh
Asset or AgroFresh Asset Class and (ii) excluding any deduction attributable
to Imputed Interest (such liability so calculated, the " _Hypothetical Tax
Liability_ ") and (B) the actual liability for Taxes due on such date with
respect to such Tax Return (" _Actual Tax Liability_ ") and, except as
otherwise provided in _Section 5(f)_, shall pay to TDCC an amount equal to
eighty-five percent (85%) of the

 



       
 

 



 

excess, if any, of the Hypothetical Tax Liability over the Actual Tax
Liability as shown in the Preliminary Determination.

 



 

(c) Within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Preliminary
Determination, TDCC shall notify Purchaser in writing of any proposed
adjustments thereto. Promptly thereafter, Purchaser shall make such
adjustments to the Preliminary Determination to the extent reasonably
requested in good faith by TDCC. If the Parties, acting in good faith, are
unable to successfully resolve the issues raised by TDCC within sixty (60)
days after delivery of the Preliminary Determination to TDCC, Purchaser and
TDCC shall submit the dispute to the Accounting Firm for resolution of the
dispute in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 4(b)_, which
resolution shall be final and binding on both Parties. Within five (5) days
after such finalization of such determination then, as applicable, (i)
Purchaser shall pay to TDCC the excess, if any, of (A) eighty-five percent
(85%) of the excess of such Hypothetical Tax Liability over such Actual Tax
Liability over (B) the aggregate amount previously paid by Purchaser to TDCC
under _Section 5(b)_ with respect to such Covered Taxable Year, or (ii) TDCC
shall pay to Purchaser the excess, if any, of (A) the aggregate amount
previously paid by Purchaser to TDCC under _Section 5(b)_ with respect to
such Taxable Year over (B) eighty-five percent (85%) of the excess, if any, of
such Hypothetical Tax Liability over such Actual Tax Liability, in each case
subject to any adjustments required by _Section 5(f)_.

 



 

(d) If the amount of any Tax Benefit Payment with respect to a Covered Taxable
Year (an " _Original Payment_ ") would have been different from the amount
actually paid for such Covered Taxable Year if calculated based upon (i) a
Final Determination relating to such Covered Taxable Year, (ii) an amended Tax
Return filed for such Covered Taxable Year for which TDCC has been previously
provided an opportunity to review and comment upon and consent to the filing
thereof as required by _Section 3(a)_ above, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, (iii) a correction of inaccuracies in the calculation
of Hypothetical Tax Liability, Stand-Alone Hypothetical Tax Liability or
Stand-Alone Actual Tax Liability identified as a result of factual information
relating to such Covered Taxable Year in the original Allocation Schedule
identified after the Closing Date as a result of the receipt of additional
information relating to facts or circumstances on or prior to the Closing
Date, or (iv) the carryback of a loss or other tax item to such Covered
Taxable Year (each, a " _Recomputing Event_ " and the Tax Benefit Payment as
so calculated, a " _Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment_ "), then, as applicable,
(A) TDCC shall pay to Purchaser the excess, if any, of the Original Payment
over the Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment together (in the case of Recomputing
Events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above) with any interest thereon,
computed at the Acceleration Rate commencing from the date the Original
Payment was due and payable, or (B) Purchaser shall pay to TDCC the excess, if
any, of the Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment over the Original Payment together
(in the case of Recomputing Events described in (i), (ii) or (iii) above) with
any interest thereon, computed at the Acceleration Rate commencing from the
date the Original Payment was due and payable. If Purchaser or TDCC receives
notice of or otherwise becomes aware of any Recomputing Event that could
result in any difference between an Original Payment and a Recomputed Tax
Benefit Payment, it shall promptly notify the other party in writing and shall
provide the other party with any related information reasonably requested by
such other party. Within thirty (30) days following notice of any such
Recomputing Event, Purchaser shall deliver a notice to TDCC setting forth the
amount of the Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment, and, upon review by TDCC, shall
promptly make adjustments to such

 



      
 

 



 

calculation to the extent reasonably requested in good faith by TDCC. If the
Parties, acting in good faith, are unable to successfully resolve the issues
raised by TDCC within sixty (60) days after delivery of the notice of the
Recomputing Event to TDCC, Purchaser and TDCC shall employ the dispute
procedures described in _Section 4(b)_. Within five (5) days of finalizing
the Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment, the Party required to make a payment
hereunder with respect to such Recomputed Tax Benefit Payment shall make such
payment to the other Party except, however, that TDCC shall not be required to
make any payment resulting from a Recomputing Event arising as a result of the
carryback of a loss or other tax attribute until ten (10) days after the
filing of the income Tax Return for the Taxable Year from which the loss or
other tax attribute was carried back.

 



 

(e) For the Covered Taxable Year following which the aggregate Basis
Adjustment (excluding for this purpose the adjustment to the Basis Adjustment
as a result of the making of the Tax Benefit Payment for such Covered Taxable
Year) has been fully depreciated or amortized (the " _Final Recovery Year_ ")
the Tax Benefit Payment shall be increased by the Gross-Up Amount. The
Preliminary Determination delivered by Purchaser with respect to the Final
Recovery Year shall include in reasonable detail the calculation of the Gross-
Up Amount, and any dispute between the Parties regarding such calculation
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
5(c)_. Except as provided in _Section 5(d)_, the Tax Benefit Payment with
respect to the Final Recovery Year shall be the final Tax Benefit Payment due
under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) For each Covered Taxable Year ending on or after the date on which an
Acquisition Event occurs, as part of the Preliminary Determination, Purchaser
shall also determine (A) the liability for Taxes of AgroFresh that would be
due on such date using the same methodology applied in the determination of
the Hypothetical Tax Liability, but calculated as if AgroFresh were the parent
of a stand-alone consolidated or combined group and no Acquisition Event had
occurred (such liability so calculated, the " _Stand-Alone Hypothetical Tax
Liability_ ") and (B) the liability for Taxes of AgroFresh that would be due
on such date, calculated as if AgroFresh were the parent or a stand-alone
consolidated or combined group and no Acquisition Event had occurred (the "
_Stand-Alone Actual Tax Liability_ "). If the excess of the Stand-Alone
Hypothetical Tax Liability over the Stand-Alone Actual Tax Liability is
greater than the excess of the Hypothetical Tax Liability over the Actual Tax
Liability determined pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ for such Covered Taxable
Year, then Purchaser shall pay to TDCC an amount equal to eighty-five percent
(85%) of the excess, if any, of the Stand-Alone Hypothetical Tax Liability
over the Stand-Alone Actual Tax Liability as shown in the Preliminary
Determination (and shall not make any additional payment pursuant to _Section
5(b)_ on such date). Any amount paid by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
5(f)_ shall be subject to review and adjustment pursuant to the principles set
forth in _Section 5(c)_ and _Section 5(d)_, in each case such that the net
Tax Benefit Payment payable by Purchaser to TDCC for each Covered Taxable Year
to which this _Section 5(f)_ applies equals the greater of (a) the excess of
the Hypothetical Tax Liability over the Actual Tax Liability and (b) the
excess of the Stand-Alone Hypothetical Tax Liability over the Stand-Alone
Actual Tax Liability, each as finally determined. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Tax Benefit Payment with respect to any Covered Taxable
Year be less than such Tax Benefit Payment would have been but for application
of this _Section 5(f)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) No duplicative payment of any amount (including interest) will be required
under this Agreement.

 



 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be made with
respect to any assets transferred to a non-U.S. Affiliate of AgroFresh
pursuant to the Restructuring Transactions.

 



 

SECTION 6. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payment by TDCC or Purchaser under
this Agreement (other than any amount treated as Imputed Interest) shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Consideration, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 7. _Acceleration; Asset Transfers_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser may terminate this Agreement at any time by paying to TDCC the
Acceleration Payment. If Purchaser chooses to exercise its right of early
termination under this _Section 7(a)_, Purchaser shall deliver to TDCC a
written notice (the " _Acceleration Notice_ ") specifying Purchasers
intention to make the Acceleration Payment and showing in reasonable detail
the calculation of the Acceleration Payment, and attaching the additional
materials described in _Section 7(b)_.

 



 

(b) At the time Purchaser delivers the Acceleration Notice to TDCC it shall
deliver to TDCC schedules and work papers providing reasonable detail
regarding the calculation of the Acceleration Payment, and within five (5)
days thereafter shall pay to TDCC an initial payment based on the estimate of
the Acceleration Payment set forth on the Acceleration Notice (the "
_Estimated Acceleration Payment_ "). The calculation of the Acceleration
Payment provided in the Acceleration Notice shall become final and binding on
the Parties unless TDCC, within thirty (30) days after receiving such
Acceleration Notice, provides Purchaser with notice of objection to such
determination of the Acceleration Payment. If the Parties, acting in good
faith, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within sixty (60) days after such Acceleration Notice was delivered to TDCC,
the dispute shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 4(b)_, and the determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding. Within five (5) days of the
determination of the Acceleration Payment becoming final and binding, as
applicable, (i) Purchaser shall pay to TDCC any amount by which the
Acceleration Payment, as finally determined, exceeds the Estimated
Acceleration Payment or (ii) TDCC shall pay to Purchaser any amount by which
the Estimated Acceleration Payment exceeds the Acceleration Payment, as
finally determined.

 



 

(c) Upon payment of the Acceleration Payment by Purchaser, neither TDCC nor
Purchaser shall have any further payment obligations under _Section 5_ of
this Agreement, other than for any (i) Tax Benefit Payment due and payable but
unpaid as of the date of the Acceleration Payment Notice and (ii) Tax Benefit
Payment due for the Covered Taxable Year ending with or including the date of
the Acceleration Payment Notice (except to the extent that the amount
described in clause (i) or (ii) is included in the calculation of the
Acceleration Payment).

 



 

(d) In the event that Purchaser transfers all or any material portion of the
AgroFresh Assets in a transaction in which the full amount of gain or loss is
not recognized for federal

 



      
 

 



 

income tax purposes and such transfer is not a Change of Control, then, within
thirty (30) days of such transfer, Purchaser shall notify TDCC, in sufficient
written detail, of such transfer of AgroFresh Assets and the date thereof (the
" _Asset Transfer Date_ "), and as soon as practicable thereafter, Purchaser
shall deliver to TDCC in writing a good faith determination of the Partial
Acceleration Payment attributable to such transfer (the " _Partial
Acceleration Payment Notice_ "). The " _Partial Acceleration Payment_ " shall
be an amount equal to the product of: (i) the Acceleration Payment (calculated
as of the Asset Transfer Date as if an Acceleration Notice had been delivered
as of such date) and (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate
adjusted basis (determined as of the Asset Transfer Date) of the amortizable
and depreciable AgroFresh Assets transferred and the denominator of which is
the aggregate adjusted basis (determined as of the Asset Transfer Date) of all
of the amortizable and depreciable AgroFresh Assets (including those
transferred on the Asset Transfer Date). The calculation of the Partial
Acceleration Payment provided in the Partial Acceleration Payment Notice shall
become final and binding on the Parties unless TDCC, within thirty (30) days
after receiving such Partial Acceleration Payment Notice, provides Purchaser
with notice of objection to such determination of the Partial Acceleration
Payment. If the Parties, acting in good faith, are unable to successfully
resolve the issues raised in such notice within sixty (60) days after such
Partial Acceleration Payment Notice was delivered to TDCC, the dispute shall
be submitted to the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section 4(b)_, and the determination of the Accounting Firm shall
be final and binding. Within five (5) days of the determination of the Partial
Acceleration Payment becoming final and binding Purchaser shall pay to TDCC an
amount equal to the Partial Acceleration Payment.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Survival of Obligations_. Except to the extent inconsistent with
applicable law, the indemnity and payment obligations set forth in this
Agreement will survive until the date which is six months after the date of
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions
or waivers thereof). The right to indemnification with respect to claims of
which notice was given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period will survive such expiration until such claim is finally resolved and
any obligations with respect thereto are fully satisfied.

 



 

SECTION 9. _Indemnity_. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless TDCC and
its Affiliates from and against any losses that are attributable to, or result
from, the breach by Purchaser or its Affiliates of any of their respective
obligations under this Agreement. The Parties shall settle any indemnification
obligations within thirty (30) days after receipt of written demand for
payment, which demand shall set forth in reasonable detail the circumstances
and amount of the indemnity payment.

 



 

SECTION 10. _Notices_. Any notices given pursuant to this Agreement shall be
made in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11\. _Payments_. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, all
payments pursuant hereto shall be made by wire transfer in Dollars in
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the payee.
The amount of all or any portion of a payment not made when due under this
Agreement shall be payable together with any interest thereon, computed at the
Late Payment Rate.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 12\. _Waivers_. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof or claim damages with respect
thereto shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the
same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of any breach of any term,
covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be
effective unless it is in a writing signed by such party, and no waiver in any
one or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of
any such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other
condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or warranty

 



 

SECTION 13. _Assignment_. No Party may assign its duties and obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of all other Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be assignable in whole in
connection with a merger or consolidation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of a Party so long as the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person assumes all the obligations of the relevant party thereto by operation
of Law or pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the other Party. This Agreement shall be binding on, and shall
inure to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and to their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



 

SECTION 14. _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by
and construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with the internal laws of
the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
law thereof.

 



 

SECTION 15. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

 



 

SECTION 16. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

 



 

SECTION 17. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all previous agreements, negotiations,
discussions, writings, understandings, commitments and conversations with
respect to such subject matter, and there are no agreements or understandings
between the Parties other than those set forth or referred to herein or in the
Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement to
the contrary, in the event and to the extent that there is a conflict between
the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement shall control. This Agreement is not intended
to confer any rights or remedies hereunder upon any person other than the
Parties hereto.

 



 

SECTION 18. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by .pdf file exchanged via email or other electronic
transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 19. _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement shall be deemed to be the joint
work product of the Parties and any rule of construction that a document shall
be interpreted or construed against a drafter of such document shall not be
applicable.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each Party hereto has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.

in order to perform fully its duties under this Agreement.

 



 

2.5 In performing the Services hereunder, TDCC and the Company acknowledge and
agree that TDCC, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall be
considered independent contractors with respect to the Company. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed to create the relationship of partnership,

among the Parties. Additionally, TDCC shall have the exclusive authority and

 



      
 

 



 

responsibility to select the means, manner and method of performing the
Services described in _Schedule 1_.

Services to the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to
reasonable access to the applicable facilities and personnel of the Company
upon advance request and as reasonably necessary to perform TDCCs obligations

instructions or policies from the Company, TDCC will comply with reasonable
input, instructions or policies of the Company, _provided_ that until the
Company provides such input, instructions or policies, TDCC may, at its
option, either be excused from performing the Services, or perform the
Services in accordance with its own applicable practices as of the date the
Services are to be delivered.

 



 

2.8 _Software Ownership Rights_.

 



 

2.8.1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that: (i) nothing in this Agreement
(including the provision of Services hereunder) shall be construed as
transferring any ownership interest in any software of any Third Party or any

referred to as a " _Third Party Provider_ "), or any proprietary software of
TDCC or its Affiliates used in connection with the provision of the Services
(" _TDCC Proprietary Software_ "); (ii) it shall not obtain or claim any
right, title or ownership interest in the Third Party Software or TDCC
Proprietary Software, or any portion thereof or any Intellectual Property
rights therein; and (iii) except for the rights granted to the Company

Intellectual Property rights, in and to all portions of the Third Party
Software and TDCC Proprietary Software, any derivative works, and any copies
thereof.

 



 

2.8.2. The Company acknowledges and agrees that it shall not make any copies
and shall have no right to receive copies of any Third Party Software or TDCC
Proprietary Software except as transferred and permitted pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement. The Company may not recompile, decompile, disassemble,
reverse engineer, or make or distribute any other form of, or any derivative
work from, TDCCs or its Affiliates hardware or software. Upon termination
of this Agreement or termination of any Service as provided under this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to TDCC all Third Party Software, all
TDCC Proprietary Software, and any copies of any of the foregoing in the
possession or control of the Company or any of its Affiliates, as the case may
be. Where TDCC has given the Company access to Intellectual Property in
connection with the Services and for a period of seven (7) years after
expiration or termination of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the Company will provide to TDCC or, at TDCCs request, to the
Third Party licensors of such Intellectual Property or independent auditors,
access at reasonable hours to the Companys personnel, the Companys
facilities, the Companys records and other pertinent information, as TDCC or
such Third Party licensor or independent auditors may reasonably request, to
verify the Companys compliance with this _Section 2.8_. Except as otherwise
provided under the Purchase Agreement, any hardware or other physical assets
acquired by TDCC or its Affiliates during the term of this Agreement in order
to provide the Services shall be owned and retained by TDCC or such
Affiliates, unless the Company specifically paid or reimbursed TDCC or its
Affiliates for any such hardware or other physical assets, in which case, TDCC
or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall transfer to the Company, without
charge, such hardware or physical assets upon the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

2.9 To the extent applicable in receiving the Services, the Company will, and
will cause its personnel and the personnel of its Affiliates to, comply with

facilitating local billing of the Service Fees set forth in _Schedule_

 



      
 

 



 

 _1_. Unless and to the extent an individual Companion Agreement expressly
provides otherwise, each Companion Agreement shall incorporate by reference
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall not be construed as
altering or superseding the rights and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement.

 



 

4.2.2. The Company shall be fully responsible and liable for all obligations
of the individual Service Recipients, and TDCC shall be fully responsible and
liable for all obligations of itself or any of TDCCs Affiliates, in each case

exercise and receive the benefits of all remedies (including damages) of each
Service Recipient, to the same extent as if the Company were such Service
Recipient, subject to the limitations of liability applicable under this

terms of all Companion Agreements) on behalf of each TDCC Affiliate that
enters into a Companion Agreement, and to assert all rights and exercise and

the TSA Execution Fee contemplated to be deferred pursuant to Section 2.3(a)
and Schedule 2.3 of the Purchase Agreement shall not be payable on the
Effective Date but instead shall be paid by the Company to TDCC on December
31, 2015. The remaining portion of the TSA Execution Fee not so deferred shall
be paid to TDCC as provided in _Section 4.3.1_ on the Effective Date.

 



 

 **Article 5:** ** ** 
TAXES

 



 

5.1 All legally required sales tax, VAT or other similar taxes will be added

5.2 If the Company is required by any applicable Law to deduct taxes from or
in respect of any sum payable to TDCC hereunder, the Service Fees invoiced to
the Company shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all
such required deductions, TDCC receives an amount equal to the sum that would
have been received had no such deductions been required.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Article 6:** ** ** 
INVOICING

 



 

6.1 TDCC will aggregate and invoice in a single invoice each month all of its
Service Fees that are to be paid by the Company for such month. With each
invoice, TDCC will provide reasonable supporting documentation with respect to
the Service Fees included thereon, provided, however, that TDCC will not be
required to divulge any Third Party pricing or other confidential information.

 



 

6.2 TDCCs Service Fees will be invoiced monthly, in arrears, and the Company
shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice.
Payments past due shall bear interest calculated on a per annum basis from but
not including the date on which payment was due through and including the date
of payment at a fluctuating interest rate equal at all times to the prime rate
of interest announced publicly from time to time by Citibank, N.A., plus three
percent (3%), but in no case higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

6.3 The Company shall not be entitled to set off or reduce payments of the
Service Fees by any amounts which it claims are owed to it by TDCC under this
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or any Related Agreement.

 



 

 **Article 7:** ** ** 
CONFIDENTIALITY

 



 

7.1 During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years after
the expiration or termination hereof (or for any longer period as may be
required by applicable Law or the terms of service of any Third Party
contractor), each Party shall keep confidential any business or technical
information provided to it by, or obtained from, the other Party (including
oral disclosures that are subsequently confirmed in writing) and identified by
the disclosing Party with the appropriate mark, stamp or legend as
"Confidential" or "Proprietary" to such disclosing Party.

 



 

7.2 Except with respect to information or materials that are subject to
restriction under privacy Laws or other Laws, no Party shall have any
confidentiality restriction hereunder regarding any information or materials
that:

 



 

7.2.1. at the time of disclosure are in the public domain or that, after
disclosure, enter the public domain except as a result of a breach of this
Agreement or any other obligation of confidentiality;

 



 

7.2.2. was in the possession of the receiving Party on a non-confidential
basis prior to receipt of the same from the disclosing Party or its
Affiliates;

 



 

7.2.3. are provided to such Party by a Third Party, except where the Third
Party is subject to an obligation to maintain such information and materials
in confidence;

 



 

7.2.4. are independently developed for such Party or its Affiliates by the
employees or contractors of such Party or its Affiliates who do not have
access to the other Partys confidential information; or

 



      
 

 



 

7.2.5. the receiving Party is legally required to disclose to Governmental
Authorities under applicable Law; provided, however, that all reasonable steps
are taken to restrict further disclosure by such Governmental Authorities and
the affected information so disclosed is not otherwise removed from the
secrecy obligation.

 



 

7.3 The receiving Party, at the disclosing Partys request, shall return all
documentation and other materials furnished to it incorporating any of the
disclosing Partys proprietary or confidential information and shall destroy
any documentation and other materials the receiving Party may have created
incorporating any such proprietary or confidential information.

 



 

7.4 If the receiving Party is required by Law or Governmental Authority to
disclose proprietary or confidential information, the receiving Party will use
its best efforts to promptly notify the disclosing Party prior to such
disclosure to enable the disclosing Party to seek a protective order at the
disclosing Partys sole expense. If the disclosing Party does not obtain such
protective order, the receiving Party will request confidential treatment of
proprietary or confidential information so disclosed.

 



 

 **Article 8:** ** ** 
STANDARD OF SERVICES; WARRANTIES; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

 



 

8.1 TDCC warrants that it shall use substantially the same level of care in
providing the Services as it does for itself and in no event less than a
reasonable level of care. TDCC may change operational aspects of the Services
or the way in which they are provided, or substitute them with other services
so long as such changes are made in a nondiscriminatory manner and the
Services are provided or procured to substantially the same level of care as
its uses for itself. If changes or substitutions are made, TDCC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts so that:

 



 

8.1.1. the Services are not disrupted; and

 



 

8.1.2. the change or substitution does not result in an increase in the
Service Fees, unless the Company has agreed to the increase in advance.

 



 

8.2 The Company warrants that it will use, and cause its Affiliates approved
to receive Services to use, the Services in accordance with all applicable
Laws, including U.S. Laws and regulations governing the export, re-export,
transfer or release of technical data to certain entities or destinations.

 



 

8.3 TDCC shall be under no obligation to materially alter or modify its
operations, procedures, method of doing business, reporting mechanisms or
information technology systems in connection with rendering any Service or
causing any Service to be rendered hereunder.

 



 

8.4 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS _SECTION 8_, NONE OF TDCC, ITS
AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES MAKE OR HAVE MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN
RESPECT OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO (A) MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, (B) THE USE OF THE SERVICE BY
COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AFTER THE

 



       
 

 



 

RECEIPT THEREOF, OR (C) THE PROBABLE SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANYS
BUSINESS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE SERVICES.

 



 

8.5 If the Company notifies TDCC in writing of any Services that do not meet
the standards in _Section 8.1_ (" _Substandard Services_ ") no later than
thirty (30) days after the Substandard Services were delivered, TDCC shall
either correctly re-perform any Substandard Services without further cost to
the Company or refund any amounts that the Company paid for such Services, at
the discretion of TDCC. Except in the case of gross negligence or willful
misconduct of TDCC, the corrective re-performance of Substandard Services or
refund in accordance with this _Section 8.5_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company (whether any such claim arises in contract, tort, breach
of warranty or any other legal or equitable theory), and the total liability
of TDCC for Substandard Services, and the Company waives any other recovery.

 



 

 **Article 9:** ** ** 
FORCE MAJEURE

 



 

9.1 If a Force Majeure Event is claimed by TDCC, TDCC shall orally notify the
Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such Force
Majeure Event.

 



 

9.2 TDCC will not be liable for any nonperformance or delay in performance of
the terms of this Agreement when such nonperformance or delay is due to a
Force Majeure Event.

 



 

9.3 Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the same will, so far as
possible, be remedied as expeditiously as possible using commercially
reasonable efforts. It is understood and agreed that nothing in this _Section
9.3_ shall require the settlement of strikes, lockouts or industrial disputes
or disturbances by acceding to the demands of any opposing party therein when
such course is inadvisable in the discretion of TDCC.

 



 

 **Article 10:** ** ** 
LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY

 



 

10.1 Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this _Article 10_,
and except as expressly provided in _Section 10.2_, the Company shall
indemnify, defend, and hold TDCC, TDCCs Affiliates, and Third Party
contractors providing the Services, together with each of their respective
directors, officers and employees, harmless from and against any and all
Losses based upon or related to the Services performed for the Company
hereunder, even if such Losses were the result of the negligence or strict
liability of TDCC, any Affiliate of TDCC or any Third Party contractor
providing the Services or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, contractors or agents.

 



 

10.2 Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this _Article 10_,
TDCC shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Company, its directors, officers
and employees, harmless from and against any and all Losses based upon or
related to the Services performed for the Company hereunder to the extent that
any such Losses were caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
TDCC.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3 In no event shall TDCC, TDCCs Affiliates or Third Party contractors
providing the Services be liable to the Company or the Companys Affiliates
for indirect, incidental, consequential (including lost profits) or punitive
damages; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to any
indirect, incidental, consequential (including lost profits) or punitive
damages asserted or awarded to any Third Party for which TDCC would otherwise
be responsible under _Section 10.2_.

 



 

10.4 Any cause of action that either Party may have against the other Party,
such other Partys Affiliates, or its or their Third Party contractors (if
any) providing the Services that may arise under or in connection with the
Services or this Agreement must be commenced within two (2) years after the
cause of action has accrued, or shall be deemed to have been waived and
withdrawn.

 



 

10.5 Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of TDCC, Affiliates of TDCC and Third Party contractors
providing the Services to the Company under or in connection with this
Agreement shall not exceed and shall be limited to the amount of the Service
Fees actually received by TDCC from the Company for the Service with respect
to which the claim is made during the six (6) months preceding the last act or
omission giving rise to such damages or, in the event such last act or
omission occurs during the first six (6) months following the Effective Date,
an amount equal to six (6) times the Service Fees paid in the month preceding
such last act or omission for the Service with respect to which the claim is
made. TDCC may, in its sole discretion, replace any Services to which any
indemnified damages are attributable in mitigation of such damages.

 



 

10.6 Except for any claims seeking equitable relief in connection with the
failure of any Party to perform its covenants or agreements hereunder, the
Parties, for themselves and their respective Affiliates, agree that the
provisions of this _Article 10_ shall be the exclusive remedies of the
Parties (and their respective Affiliates) with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and the Parties (and their respective Affiliates) shall not
be entitled to any further indemnification, contribution, recovery or other
rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof (whether under
this Agreement or under any common law theory or any statute or other Law or
otherwise), all of which the Parties hereby waive.

 



 

10.7 The Company agrees that any and all claims, disputes or demands that the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company may have that is in any way related to
the provision of the Services (whether the Service(s) in question was provided
by TDCC, an Affiliate of TDCC or a Third Party contractor of TDCC) shall only
be asserted against TDCC (and not against an Affiliate or Third Party
contractor of TDCC) under and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Article 11:** ** ** 
TERMINATION

 



 

11.1 The Company may terminate this Agreement (in whole) at any time upon at
least ninety (90) days prior written notice to TDCC. The Company may also
terminate less than all of the Services subject to _Section 11.2_, subject to
the written notice periods set forth therein.

 



      
 

 



 

11.2 _Termination of Highly Integrated Services_. If the Company wishes to
terminate any Service designated in _Schedule 1_ as "Highly Integrated"
without also terminating all of the other Services under this Agreement, the
Company shall request that TDCC evaluate the cost and operational impact of
terminating such Highly Integrated Services using the and other subject matter
experts for the affected Services. Such evaluation shall take into account, as
applicable, the scope of integrated service dependencies, interfaces necessary
to continue to provide ongoing Services, the data elements necessary for the
Company to bid replacement services, and the recommendations for components of
Disengagement Services necessary to accomplish the migration of the relevant
services to the Company or a third party. The Parties shall work together in
good faith to find a mutually acceptable approach for the termination of such
Highly Integrated Services. If the Parties agree on an approach for
terminating such Highly Integrated Services, such Highly Integrated Services
shall be terminated in accordance with such approach. TDCC will notify the
Company if the Company selects an approach for removing Highly Integrated
Services that would have an adverse impact on TDCCs costs to provide and/or
its ability to perform the remaining Services (it being understood that the
evaluation of such impact on TDCCs costs shall only consider the resulting
costs of providing remaining Services post termination of the requested Highly
Integrated Services and shall not include any impact on TDCCs costs with
respect to maintaining or providing such terminated Service for or to any
other party). The Company may then either choose to proceed with its approach
or withdraw its request. If the Company elects to proceed with its proposed
approach for removing the Highly Integrated Services, (1) the Company shall be
responsible for any resulting increase in the Service Fees associated with the
additional costs incurred by TDCC (as determined in accordance with the Price
Adjustment Process in _Schedule 1-D_ ); (2) TDCC shall have the right to
terminate any remaining Services that cannot be practicably provided as a
result of the removal of the Highly Integrated Services. The Parties shall
document the approach and any resulting impact on the remaining Services and
Service Fees in writing prior to proceeding with the removal of the Highly
Integrated Services.

 



 

11.2.1. _Services Other Than Highly Integrated Services_. If the Company
desires to terminate for convenience any Services that are not Highly
Integrated Services, it will provide the amount of notice (i) mutually
determined by the Parties representatives in good faith, taking into account
(A) the complexity of the Service(s) to be terminated and (B) any reasonably
anticipated Disengagement Services required. If the Parties representatives
are not able to agree on a specific notice period, then it will be thirty (30)
days from the date on which notice to terminate is received by TDCC from the
Company.

 



 

11.2.2. In the event of any termination of Services, such termination shall
not in any event entitle the Company or any third party to use the TDCC
Systems or any Intellectual Property owned or licensed by TDCC or its
Affiliates and supplied to the Company under this Agreement for the
performance of the terminated Services, nor shall it entitle the Company or
require TDCC to disclose any of TDCCs Confidential Information to any third
parties

 



 

11.2.3. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties or required by the terms
of this Agreement, the termination of any Services shall be effective as of a
calendar month end.

 



 

11.2.4. The Price Adjustment Process in _Schedule 1-D_ shall apply in the
event of a termination of any Services (among other Price Adjustment Events).

 



      
 

 



 

11.3 TDCC may terminate this Agreement or suspend performance of its
obligations hereunder in the event the Company (i) fails to pay any invoice
sent to the Company pursuant to _Article 6_ within thirty (30) days of the
invoice date or (ii) materially breaches this Agreement (other than as
described in _clause (i)_ above) and fails to cure such breach within fifteen
(15) days after TDCC sends the Company written notice of such breach.

 



 

11.4 The Parties may mutually agree in writing to terminate this Agreement or
any portion thereof at any time.

 



 

11.5 Either Party may terminate this Agreement, upon written notice having
immediate effect, in the event that the other Party (i) files for bankruptcy,
(ii) becomes or is declared insolvent, or is the subject of any proceedings
(not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to its liquidation, insolvency
or the appointment of a receiver or similar officer, (iii) makes an assignment
for the benefit of all or substantially all of its creditors, (iv) takes any
corporate action for its winding-up, dissolution or administration or (v)
enters into an agreement for the extension or readjustment of substantially
all of its obligations or if it suffers any foreign equivalent of the
foregoing.

 



 

11.6 Except as provided in _Section 11.9_ and subject to any rights or
obligations which have accrued prior to termination, neither Party shall have
any further obligations to the other Party in respect of the part or parts of
this Agreement that have been terminated.

 



 

11.7 Commencing (i) upon expiration of the term of this Agreement, (ii) upon
receiving the Companys notice of termination, or (iii) upon TDCCs notice of
termination pursuant to this _Section 11_ of the Agreement, and continuing
for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days (or, if less, the remaining term
of this Agreement) after the applicable commencement date, TDCC will provide
Disengagement Services reasonably requested by the Company, subject to the
Parties mutual agreement on the price of such Disengagement Services;
provided that if this Agreement is terminated by TDCC pursuant to this clause
(i) of _Section 11.3_ due to the Companys failure to make payment when due,
TDCCs obligation to provide Disengagement Services shall be conditioned upon
the Company paying all past-due amounts and paying monthly in advance for all
further Services including Disengagement Services. The Disengagement Services
shall be agreed to in writing by the Parties. The Company will remain
responsible for the Service Fees for ongoing Services during the period of
disengagement, which shall be the same as the Service Fees for the ongoing
Services otherwise provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

11.8 Upon termination of this Agreement, each Party shall return or deliver to
the other Party all proprietary or confidential information received from the
other Party and shall take all reasonable measures to expunge such information
from any computer, word processor or other device containing such information;
provided, however, that (i) a Party shall not be required to expunge
electronic material in backup or archive storage where to do so would be
commercially impracticable and the material is unavailable to general users or
if the material is only retrievable using forensic computer recovery
techniques, which electronic material (if any) shall remain subject to such
Partys obligations under this Agreement and (ii) TDCC shall not be required
to return, deliver or delete data or information that is commingled with data
or information of TDCC, that pertains to time periods prior to the Effective
Date, or that is stored by TDCC other

 



      
 

 



 

than in electronic form; provided, however, that any confidential information
of the Company that is retained by TDCC shall be continue to be subject to the
obligations of _Article 7_.

 



 

11.9 Upon the earlier to occur of (x) the Termination Date or (y) the
applicable Service Termination Date of the Services to which such equipment or
other assets relate, the Company shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly
return or deliver to TDCC or its designated Affiliate any equipment or other
assets owned by or leased to TDCC, its Affiliates or any Third Party
contractor that are in the possession of the Company in connection with the
provision of such Services.

 



 

11.10 Upon termination of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately pay
all amounts accrued for Services and work performed prior to the applicable
Service Termination Date that have not already been paid.

 



 

11.11 The Surviving Provisions, together with any other clause reasonably
intended to survive termination, shall survive termination of this Agreement
or a Service.

during which such Seconded Employees shall continue to be employed by Dow but
be assigned to a position within the Host Company; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, following the conclusion of their respective

Seconded Employees became Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date (other
than the Seconded Employees participation in

 



      
 

 



 

benefit plans sponsored by Dow and its Affiliates following the Closing Date),
(2) the Seconded Employees shall become, subject to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, Transferred Employees at the conclusion of their respective
Secondments, and (3) following the conclusion of their Secondments, the
treatment of the Seconded Employees shall be governed by the terms of the
Purchase Agreement as though they had become Transferred Employees upon the

Secondment Termination Date. Provided that the Seconded Employees accept the
offers of employment, the Host Company recognizes and agrees that the Seconded
Employees shall be entitled to the same treatment as the Transferred
Employees, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, beginning on the Secondment
Termination Date.

 



 

3.7 Unless the Seconded Employee is terminated for cause or voluntarily
resigns, the Host Company shall reimburse Dow for any severance payment owed
by Dow to a Seconded Employee under the terms of a TDCC Benefit Plan by reason

(30) days of receipt of the applicable invoice. Payments shall be made in
immediately available funds by wire transfer into the bank account specified
in the invoice or otherwise communicated by Dow (or its Affiliate) on or

remains unpaid after its due date, Dow (or its Affiliate, as applicable) shall
be entitled to receive interest on the unpaid amount accruing from (but
excluding) the relevant due date up to (and including) the date of actual
payment in full at a rate equal to LIBOR (as quoted on the due date) plus one
percent (1%). Such interest shall accrue from day to day on the basis of a
365-day year.

Affiliates, except as provided in _Article 6_ (Indemnities) hereof, accept
any obligation or liability whatsoever for the acts, omissions, or other
performance of the Seconded Employees during the Secondments. In no event

incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.

expenses, liabilities, obligations, and damages (including reasonable

accrue and arise out of, result from, or relate to (a) the acts, omissions, or
other performance of services by the Seconded Employees during the
Secondments, (b) any negligent or intentional act or omission on the part of
the Host Company, its Affiliates, or their respective officers, employees

its Affiliates, failure to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, or
orders with respect to the Seconded Employees, except as set forth in Section
6.2 below.

 



 

6.2. Dow shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Host Company, its

assessments, penalties, fines, administrative orders, claims, losses,
expenses, liabilities, obligations, and damages (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses incidental thereto) that in any way arise
out of, result from, or relate to (a) Dows failure to comply with all
applicable laws, regulations, or orders with respect to the Seconded
Employees, including but not limited to payment of compensation and benefits,
or (b) any negligent or intentional act or omission on the part of Dow, its
Affiliates, or their respective officers, employees (excluding the Seconded
Employees during the Secondments), or agents, or (c) any claim, demand, or
cause of action that may be brought by any Seconded Employee or his or her
heirs for personal injury to, or death of, the Seconded Employee (to the
extent covered by Dows statutorily required workers compensation and
disability coverage or national equivalent thereof applicable to the Seconded
Employee), except to the extent such personal injury to, or death of, the
Seconded Employee is caused by the negligent or intentional act or omission of
the Host Company, its Affiliates, or their respective officers, employees
(including, without limitation, the Seconded Employees during the
Secondments), or agents.

 



 

6.3. The Host Company and Dow agree to (a) notify each other in writing of any
asserted claim within ten (10) working days of either discovery of the
occurrence upon which the claim may be based or learning of the claim,
whichever occurs first, and (b) permit Dow or the Host Company, as the case
may be, to defend the claim at the option of the Party against whom the claim
is asserted, with counsel acceptable to that Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably refused. No Party may pay or agree to pay any asserted claim
under this Agreement without prior written approval from the Party against
whom the claim is asserted, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that approval on behalf of Dow must be obtained in writing
from the Dow Legal Department in Midland, Michigan.

 



 

7. _FORCE MAJEURE_

 



 

7.1. No Party shall be liable to another Party hereto for its failure or delay
in performing its obligations hereunder (other than its obligations to pay

Agreement, their employees, including the Seconded Employees, may receive, or
otherwise acquire, information that the Party disclosing the information (the

Disclosing Party is obligated to keep in confidence pursuant to an agreement
with a third party. Except as otherwise provided to the contrary in any
general confidentiality and non-use agreements between Dow and the Host
Company, the Party receiving the disclosure of any the proprietary and
confidential information (the " _Receiving Party_ "), and its employees, agree
to maintain any and all proprietary and confidential information transmitted
to it, or its employees, by the Disclosing Party, or otherwise acquired by it,
or its employees, as a result of the performance of services for the Host
Company by the Seconded Employees or being present on the Disclosing Partys
premises, in strict confidence. The Receiving Party agrees to, and shall cause
its employees to, not disclose the information to any third party or use the
information on its (or its employees) own behalf, without the prior written
consent of the Disclosing Party. All business and technical information
received, developed, observed, or otherwise acquired by the Receiving Party or
its employees, including the Seconded Employees, as a result of performing
services for the Host Company, or being present at the Disclosing Partys
premises, is presumed to be confidential. The obligations of confidence and
non-use described in this _Article 8_ shall not apply to any information that
(a) was known to the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing
Party, or as a result of performing services for the Disclosing Party or being
present on the Disclosing Partys premises, (b) is or becomes known to the
public through no fault of the Receiving Party, (c) the Receiving Party is
legally required by statute, subpoena, or other valid court order, to disclose
by a Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction, provided the
Receiving Party gives notice to the Disclosing Party as soon as reasonably
possible regarding its obligation to disclose the information, (d) corresponds
in substance to that furnished to the Receiving Party by others as a matter of
right without restriction on disclosure, or (e) corresponds in substance to
that independently developed by or for the Receiving Party.

attached to and made part of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _WORK PRODUCT OWNERSHIP_

 



 

9.1. All Work Product created by the Seconded Employees shall be owned as
between Dow, the Seconded Employees, and the Host Company, solely by the Host
Company, either by operation of the "work for hire" doctrine, to the extent it
is applicable, or by assignment from Dow or its Affiliate, as applicable. In
this regard, Dow hereby assigns to the Host Company, its nominee, successor or
assign, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Work Product, including
the United States and foreign patents, patent applications, copyrights,

applications, copyrights, and other legal protection in the Host Company, its
nominee, successor, or assign, including, but not limited to, any papers
relating to interferences, oppositions, invalidations, conflicts, reissues,
reexaminations, divisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, or
litigation relating to any Work Product. Neither Dow nor any of its Affiliates
shall retain any proprietary interest in the Work Product. Under no
circumstances shall the Work Product be conveyed, disclosed, released, or
exploited for the benefit of Dow, its Affiliates, or any of their respective
employees, or any third party without the prior written consent of the Host
Company.

a regularly recurring amount, only one such notice shall be required for all
such regularly recurring amounts due during the period specified in such
notice).

 



 

2.4 **Holding Over**. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this
Sublease, Tenant agrees to vacate and deliver the Subleased Premises, and all
keys thereto, to Landlord. If Tenant does not vacate the Subleased Premises
upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease, Tenant shall be a
tenant at sufferance for the holdover period and all of the terms and
provisions of this Sublease shall be applicable during that period, except
that Tenant shall at the option of Landlord pay to Landlord (in addition to
any other sums payable under this Sublease) as base rental for the period of
such holdover an amount equal to 200% of the Base Rent which

 



      
 

 



 

would have been payable by Tenant had the holdover period been a part of the
original term of this Sublease (without waiver of Landlords right to recover
damages as permitted by law) but not less than the amount, if any, Landlord is
required to pay under the Prime Lease in such event for the Subleased
Premises. The rental payable during the holdover period shall be payable to
Landlord on demand. No holding over by Tenant, whether with or without the
consent of Landlord, shall operate to extend the term of this Sublease. Tenant
shall indemnify Landlord against all claims made by Prime Landlord or any
tenant or prospective tenant against Landlord resulting from delay by Landlord
in delivering possession of the Subleased Premises to the Prime Landlord or
such other tenant or prospective tenant, to the extent caused by holding over
by Tenant.

Subleased Premises.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The foregoing notwithstanding, this Sublease does not create any rights in
Prime Landlord or any third parties, and if there are any provisions in the
Prime Lease that pertain to Landlords rights regarding:

 



 

(i) any option or election, including any option to renew or extend the term
thereof, or to expand the premises thereunder, or any preferential right or
right of first refusal on any additional space; or

 



 

(ii) any exclusive uses in favor of Landlord; or

 



 

(iii) any sign rights (or rights regarding the name of the Building) in favor
of Landlord; or

 



 

(iv) any tenant finish or other construction obligations; or

 



 

(v) any parking rights of Landlord; or

 



 

(vi) any provisions of the Prime Lease that apply uniquely to Landlord;

 



 

then none of such provisions shall be incorporated herein and Tenant shall not
have any rights or benefits thereunder.

 



 

7.3 **Subject to Prime Lease**. This Sublease is expressly subject to and
inferior to the Prime Lease.

to Tenant, or to Tenants employees, agents, subtenants, licensees, invitees,
or visitors, or to any other person whomever, for any loss, or any damage to
or loss of any property or death or injury to any person occasioned by or
arising out of (a) the condition or design of or any defect in or failure to
repair the Subleased Premises or the Property or any part or component thereof
(including without limitation any mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating,

Prime Landlord, other tenants or occupants in the Property or of any other
persons whomever; or (c) burglary, theft, vandalism, malicious mischief, fire,

under the Prime Lease (including without limitation slow-down, interruption,
failure or cessation of any service to be provided by Prime Landlord).

 



 

8.3 **Tenant s Indemnification of Landlord**. Tenant hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against all fines, suits,
claims, demands, loss, cost, liability, judgments and expenses (including

every kind in connection with any loss, or any death or injury to person or
damage to or loss of property to the extent caused by any act, omission, or
neglect of Tenant, its employees, agents, subtenants, licensees, invitees, or
visitors or any other person entering the Property or the Subleased Premises
under express or implied invitation or permission of Tenant, or arising out of
the occupancy or use of the Subleased Premises by Tenant.

 



 

8.4 **Waiver of Recovery**. Anything in this Lease to the contrary
notwithstanding, Landlord and Tenant severally waive any claim in its favor
against the other or the other employees or agents (REGARDLESS OF CAUSE,

LIABILITY OF ANY KIND) for loss of or damage to any of its property located on
or constituting a part of the Leased Premises or the Property, by reason of
fire or the elements, or any other cause that is insured, or is insurable

Tenant; or (6) Tenant shall be in default of any other term, provision or
covenant of this Lease, other than those specified in clauses (1) through (5)
above, and such default is not cured within thirty (30) days after written
notice thereof to Tenant; provided, that if the default is

 



      
 

 



 

a potential event of default under the Prime Lease, Tenant shall only have the
grace or cure period, if any, afforded Landlord under the Prime Lease, less
five (5) days.

 



 

10.2 **Remedies for Tenant s Default**. If there shall be an event of default
as set forth in Section 10.1 above, Landlord may treat the occurrence of any
one or more of such events as a breach of this Sublease, and at its option may
have any one or more of the following described remedies without any
additional notice or demand, in addition to all other rights and remedies
provided at law or in equity or elsewhere in this Sublease:

 



 

(a) Without declaring the Lease terminated, Landlord may enter upon and take
possession of the Subleased Premises, by picking or changing locks if
necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may
be occupying all or any part of the Subleased Premises without being liable
for any claim for damages, and relet the Subleased Premises on behalf of
Tenant and receive the rent directly by reason of the reletting. Tenant agrees
to pay Landlord on demand any deficiency that may arise by reason of any
reletting of the Subleased Premises; further, Tenant agrees to reimburse
Landlord for any expenditures made by it in order to relet the Subleased
Premises, including, but not limited to, remodeling and repair costs.

 



 

(b) Without declaring the Lease terminated, Landlord may enter upon the
Subleased Premises, by picking or changing locks if necessary, without being
liable for any claim for damages, and do whatever Tenant is obligated to do
under the terms of this Sublease. Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord on
demand for any expenses which Landlord may incur in effecting compliance with
Tenants obligations under this Sublease. Landlord shall not be liable for any
damages resulting to Tenant from effecting compliance with Tenants
obligations under this Sublease WHETHER CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF LANDLORD
OR OTHERWISE.

 



 

(c) Landlord may terminate this Sublease, in which event Tenant shall
immediately surrender the Subleased Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails
to surrender the Subleased Premises, Landlord may, without prejudice to any
other remedy which it may have for possession or arrearages in rent, enter
upon and take possession of the Subleased Premises, by picking or changing
locks if necessary, and lock out, expel or remove Tenant and any other person
who may be occupying all or any part of the Subleased Premises without being
liable for any claim for damages. Tenant agrees to pay on demand the amount of
all loss and damage which Landlord may suffer for any reason due to the
termination of this Lease under this _Section 10.2_, including (without
limitation) loss and damage due to the failure of Tenant to maintain and/or
repair the Subleased Premises as required hereunder and/or due to the
inability of Landlord to relet the Subleased Premises on satisfactory terms or
otherwise.

 



 

Landlords exercise, following a default by Tenant under this Sublease, of any
right granted hereunder or under any applicable law to lock out or change the
locks securing the Subleased Premises shall not impose upon Landlord any duty
to notify Tenant of the name and address or telephone number of the individual
or company from whom a new key may be obtained, nor shall Landlord have any
duty to provide Tenant with a new key or any other means of access to the
Subleased Premises.

 



      
 

 



 

In addition to any other remedy set forth in this Sublease, if Landlord has
made rent concessions of any type or character, or waived any Base Rent, and
Tenant fails to take possession of the Subleased Premises on the Rent
Commencement Date or otherwise defaults at any time during the term of this
Sublease, the rent concessions, including any waived Base Rent, shall be
cancelled and the amount of the Base Rent or other rent concessions shall be
due and payable immediately as if no rent concessions or waiver of any Base
Rent had ever been granted. A rent concession or waiver of the Base Rent shall
not relieve Tenant of any obligation to pay any other charge due and payable
under this Sublease, including, without limitation, any sum due under _Section
2.3_ of this Sublease. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Sublease to
the contrary, this Sublease may be terminated by Landlord only by written
notice of such termination given by Landlord to Tenant, and no other act or
omission of Landlord shall be construed as a termination of this Sublease.

 



 

Tenant expressly agrees that any judgment, order or decree entered against
Tenant by or in any court of Magistrate by virtue of the powers of attorney
contained in this Lease, or otherwise, shall be final with respect to
possession of the Subleased Premises, and releases to Landlord and to any and
all attorneys who may appear for Landlord all errors in the said proceedings
except those errors relating to the facts of the underlying claim by Landlord
against Tenant, and all liability therefor. Tenant expressly waives the
benefits of all laws, now or hereafter in force, exempting any goods on the
Subleased Premises, or elsewhere from distraint, levy or sale in any legal
proceedings taken by Landlord to enforce any rights under this Sublease.
Tenant hereby waives all errors and imperfections in any proceedings brought
hereunder against Tenant. If proceedings shall be commenced by Landlord to
recover possession under the Acts of Assembly, either at the end of the
Sublease Term or earlier termination of the Sublease, or for nonpayment of
rent or any other reason, Tenant specifically waives all rights to notice
under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951, 68 P.S. §250.101 et seq., as same
may be amended from time to time (the "Landlord and Tenant Act"), including,
without limitation, the right to the three months notice and/or the ten,
fifteen or thirty days notice required by the Landlord and Tenant Act.

 **SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED**

 



 

 **CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION**

 



 

 **OF**

 



 

 **[CORPORATION NAME]**

 



 

[ ], 2015

 



 

[Corporation Name], a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware (the " ** _Corporation_** "), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY AS
FOLLOWS:

 



 

1. The present name of the Corporation is " ** _Boulevard Acquisition Corp._** ". The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 24, 2013 and amended and restated and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 12, 2014 (the " ** _Amended Certificate_** ").

 



 

2. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the " ** _Second Amended Certificate_** "), which both restates and further amends the provisions of the Amended Certificate, was duly adopted in accordance with Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " ** _DGCL_** "), at a special meeting duly called and held upon notice in accordance with Section 222 of the DGCL at which meeting the necessary number of shares as required by statute and the Amended Certificate were voted in favor of the Second Amended Certificate.

 



 

3. The text of the Amended Certificate is hereby restated and amended in its entirety to read as follows:

 



 

 _FIRST:_ The name of the corporation is [Corporation Name] (the "
_Corporation_ ").

 



 

 _SECOND:_ The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the
State of Delaware is [ ], in the City of [ ], County of [
], State of Delaware, postal code [ ]. The name of the
registered agent of the Corporation at that address is [ ]

 



 

 _THIRD:_ The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which a corporation may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

 



 

 _FOURTH:_ A. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is [ ], consisting of [ ]
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "),
and [ ] shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "
_Preferred Stock_ ").

 



 

B. The board of directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is hereby
expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof (the certificate of
designations setting forth a copy of such

      
 

 



 

resolution or resolutions filed pursuant to the applicable law of the State of
Delaware is being hereinafter referred to as a " _Preferred Stock Designation_
"), to provide from time to time out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock
for one or more series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such
series, to establish the number of shares constituting each such series, and
to fix the designation, powers (including voting powers), preferences, and
relative, participating, optional, special or other rights, if any, of the
shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions, if any, of the shares of such series. The designation, powers,
preferences, and relative, participating, optional, special or other rights,
if any, of the shares of each series of Preferred Stock and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions, if any, of the shares of each
series of Preferred Stock may differ from those of any and all other series of
Preferred Stock at any time outstanding. Except as may otherwise be provided
in this Second Amended Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred
Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), no holder of an
outstanding share of any series of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled
to any voting powers in respect thereof.

 



 

C. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to
one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the
Corporation for their vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise
required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any
amendment to this Second Amended Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class
with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to
this Second Amended Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or the DGCL.

 



 

 _FIFTH:_ The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders:

 



 

A. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board. In addition to the powers and authority expressly
conferred upon them by statute or by this Second Amended Certificate or the
bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all
such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the
Corporation, except as otherwise specifically required by law or as otherwise
provided in this Second Amended Certificate of Incorporation.

 



 

B. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot
unless the bylaws so provide.

 



 

C. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred
Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any consent in
writing by such stockholders.

 



 

D. Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred
Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only
by the Board acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the
Whole Board. For purposes of this Second Amended

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate, the term "Whole Board" shall mean the total number of authorized
directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships.

 



 

 _SIXTH:_ A. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number
of directors of the Corporation, shall be fixed from time to time in the
manner provided in the bylaws.

 



 

B. The Board (other than those directors elected by the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock provided for or fixed pursuant to the
provisions of FOURTH, Section B) shall be divided into three classes, as
nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class II and Class
III. The term of the initial Class I directors shall expire at the first
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended Certificate; the term of the initial
Class II directors shall expire at the second annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended Certificate; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall
expire at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
following the effectiveness of this Second Amended Certificate. At each
succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning
with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following
the effectiveness of this Second Amended Certificate, successors to the class
of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a
three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective
successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal.
If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of
directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent
director. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or
resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the
aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended Certificate (and therefore
such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article SIXTH, and except as
otherwise required by law, whenever the holders of one or more series of
Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to
elect one or more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the
removal from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed
by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second
Amended Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this
Article SIXTH unless expressly provided by such terms.

 



 

C. A majority of the Whole Board shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at
any meeting of the Board, and, except as otherwise expressly required by law
or by this Second Amended Certificate, all matters shall be determined by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at
which a quorum is present.

 



 

D. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board resulting from
death, resignation, disqualification, removal from office or other cause
shall, unless otherwise required by law or by resolution of the Board, be
filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office, though less
than a quorum (and not by stockholders), and directors so chosen shall serve
for a term expiring at the annual meeting of

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders at which the term of office of the class to which they have been
chosen expires, with each director to hold office until his or her successor
shall have been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the authorized
number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

 



 

E. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, any director, or the entire Board, may be removed from office at
any time, but only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-
six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote
at an election of directors, voting together as a single class.

 



 

 _SEVENTH:_ In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board is expressly empowered to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or repeal
of the bylaws of the Corporation by the Board shall require the approval of a
majority of the Whole Board. The stockholders shall also have power to adopt,
amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended Certificate (including
any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock),
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (662/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together
as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision
of the bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 _EIGHTH:_ A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

 



 

Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing paragraph shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation
thereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such amendment, modification or repeal.

 



 

 _NINTH:_ The Corporation reserves the right at any time, and from time to
time, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second
Amended Certificate, and the other provisions authorized by the laws of the
State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by the laws of the State of Delaware; and all
rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature conferred upon
stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to
this Second Amended Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended
are granted subject to this reservation; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended Certificate or any
provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of
this

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended Certificate (including
any Preferred Stock Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock),
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (662/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of
the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together
as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal this Article NINTH,
Sections C or D of Article FIFTH, Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, or Article
EIGHTH.

 



 

 _TENTH:_ To the maximum extent permitted from time to time under the laws of
the State of Delaware, the Corporation renounces any interest or expectancy of
the Corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in,
business opportunities that are from time to time presented to its directors
or stockholders, other than those directors or stockholders who are employees
of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. No amendment or repeal of this
Article TENTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any officer, director or stockholder of the Corporation for or
with respect to any opportunities of which such director or stockholder
becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal.

 



 

 _ELEVENTH:_ The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section
203 of the DGCL.

 



 

 _TWELFTH:_ Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "
_Court of Chancery_ ") or, if the Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of
the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii)
any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL,
this Second Amended Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or the bylaws of the Corporation
(as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a
claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. If any action the subject
matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed in a
court other than a court located in the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to
have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action
brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and (y) having
service of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service
upon such stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such
stockholder. If any provision or provisions of this Article TWELFTH shall be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person or
entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provisions
in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article
TWELFTH (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence of this
Article TWELFTH containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable)
and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and
circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, [Corporation Name] has caused this Second Amended
Certificate to be duly executed and acknowledged in its name and on its behalf
by an authorized officer as of the date first set forth above.

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED**

 



 

 **BY LAWS 
OF 
[Name of Surviving Corporation] (THE "CORPORATION")**

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **OFFICES**

 



 

 **Section 1.1.** ** ****Registered Office**. The registered office of the
Corporation within the State of Delaware shall be located at either (a) the
principal place of business of the Corporation in the State of Delaware or (b)
the office of the corporation or individual acting as the Corporations
registered agent in Delaware.

 



 

 **Section 1.2.** ** ****Additional Offices**. The Corporation may, in
addition to its registered office in the State of Delaware, have such other
offices and places of business, both within and outside the State of Delaware,
as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " ** _Board_** ") may from
time to time determine or as the business and affairs of the Corporation may
require.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS**

 



 

 **Section 2.1.** ** ****Annual Meetings**. The annual meeting of
stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State
of Delaware, and time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and
stated in the notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole
discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may
instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to _Section
9.5(a)_. At each annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect those directors
of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date
of such annual meeting and may transact any other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

 



 

 **Section 2.2.** ** ****Special Meetings**. Subject to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation (" **
_Preferred Stock_** "), special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or
purposes, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the
Board, and may not be called by any other person. Special meetings of
stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State
of Delaware, and time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and
stated in the Corporations notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may
in its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any
place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication
pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_.

 



 

 **Section 2.3.** ** ****Notices**. Written notice of each stockholders
meeting stating the place, if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the
means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,

 



      
 

 



 

and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be given in the manner
permitted by _Section 9.3_ to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting, by the Corporation not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
date of the meeting unless otherwise required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " ** _DGCL_** "). If said notice is for a
stockholders meeting other than an annual meeting, it shall in addition state
the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business
transacted at such meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in the
Corporations notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto). Any meeting of
stockholders as to which notice has been given may be postponed, and any
meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be cancelled, by
the Board upon public announcement (as defined in _Section 2.7 (c)_) given
before the date previously scheduled for such meeting.

 



 

 **Section 2.4.** ** ****Quorum**. Except as otherwise provided by applicable
law, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be
amended or restated from time to time (the " ** _Certificate of
Incorporation_** ") or these By Laws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at
a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock
of the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at
such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such
meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or
series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series
shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such
business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting
may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in _Section
2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly convened
meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of
its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a
majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of
directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the
Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of
the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

 



 

 **Section 2.5.** ** ****Voting of Shares.**

 



 

(a) _Voting Lists_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote
at such meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date,
the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day
before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the
address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall require the Corporation to
include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on
such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for
any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place
of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is
present. If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote
communication as permitted by _Section 9.5(a)_, the list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting. The stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the list required by this _Section 2.5(a)_ or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 



 

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote
communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission
(as defined in _Section 9.3_), provided that any such electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the
Corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was authorized by
the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in its discretion, or the chairman
of the meeting of stockholders, in such persons discretion, may require that
any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

 



 

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without limiting the
manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act
for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a
valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority.

 



 

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed to
such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

 



 

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either
set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.

 



      
 

 



 

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

 



 

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at
all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of
directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a
majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the
matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation,
these By Laws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is
required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the decision
of such matter.

 



 

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. The Board may, and shall if required by law, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as
inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise
serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace
any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or alternates are
appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or
her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding
shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine and
retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges
made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their determination
of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all
votes and ballots. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election
may serve as an inspector at such election. Each report of an inspector shall
be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is
more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one
inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.

 



 

 **Section 2.6.** ** ****Adjournments**. Any meeting of stockholders, annual
or special, may be adjourned, from time to time, whether or not there is a
quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice need not be given
of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any, thereof,
and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the

to _Section 3.2_ will be considered for election at such meeting.

 



 

(i) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other than
nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder,
such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form
to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business must otherwise be a
proper matter for stockholder action. Subject to _Section 2.7(a)(iii)_, a
stockholders notice to the Secretary with respect to such business, to be
timely, must be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices
of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the anniversary
date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that in the event that the annual meeting is more than 30 days before
or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to
be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the
120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of (x) the close of
business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close of business on
the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the

adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time
period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as
described in this _Section 2.7(a)_.

 



 

(ii) To be in proper written form, a stockholders notice to the Secretary
with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to
each such matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting
(A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of
any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such business
includes a proposal to amend these By Laws, the language of the proposed
amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting,

stockholder and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the proposal is made, (C) the class or series and number of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by
such stockholder and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the

that such stockholder (or a qualified representative of such stockholder)
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such
business before the meeting.

 



 

(iii) The foregoing notice requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations)
if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholders
intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " ** _Exchange Act_** "), and such stockholder has complied
with the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy
statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual
meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders
except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_, provided, however, that once
business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance
with such procedures, nothing in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be deemed to
preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business. If the Board or
the chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal
was not made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ or
that the information provided in a stockholders notice does not satisfy the
information requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_, such proposal shall not be
presented for action at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_, if the stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in

shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.

stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporations proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting. Nominations of
persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporations notice of meeting only pursuant to _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(c) _Public Announcement_. For purposes of these By Laws, " ** _public
announcement_** " shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow
Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in

of the Corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, subject to the sole
discretion of the Board and the requirements of the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 7.2.** ** ****Multiple Classes of Stock**. If the Corporation
shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one
series of any class, the Corporation shall (a) cause the powers, designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights to be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of any certificate that the Corporation issues
to represent shares of such class or series of stock or (b) in the case of
uncertificated shares, within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer
of such shares, send to the registered owner thereof a written notice
containing the information required to be set forth on certificates as
specified in clause (a) above; provided, however, that, except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may
be set forth on the face or back of such certificate or, in the case of
uncertificated shares, on such written notice a statement that the Corporation
will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers,
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences or rights.

 



 

 **Section 7.3.** ** ****Signatures**. Each certificate representing capital
stock of the Corporation shall be signed by or in the name of the Corporation
by (a) the Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice President and (b)
the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation. Any or all the signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or

 



      
 

 



 

registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar
before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be issued by the
Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer
agent or registrar on the date of issue.

 



 

 **Section 7.4.** ** ****Consideration and Payment for Shares.**

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, shares of
stock may be issued for such consideration, having in the case of shares with
par value a value not less than the par value thereof, and to such persons, as
determined from time to time by the Board. The consideration may consist of
cash, tangible or intangible property or any benefit to the Corporation or any
combination thereof.

 



 

(b) Subject to applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation, shares may
not be issued until the full amount of the consideration has been paid, unless
upon the face or back of each certificate issued to represent any partly paid
shares of capital stock or upon the books and records of the Corporation in
the case of partly paid uncertificated shares, there shall have been set forth
the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid
thereon up to and including the time said certificate representing
certificated shares or said uncertificated shares are issued.

 



 

 **Section 7.5.** ** ****Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates.**

 



 

(a) If an owner of a certificate representing shares claims that such
certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Corporation
shall issue a new certificate representing such shares or such shares in
uncertificated form if the owner: (i) requests such a new certificate before
the Corporation has notice that the certificate representing such shares has
been acquired by a protected purchaser; (ii) if requested by the Corporation,
delivers to the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, wrongful taking or destruction of such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares; and (iii) satisfies
other reasonable requirements imposed by the Corporation.

 



 

(b) If a certificate representing shares has been lost, apparently destroyed
or wrongfully taken, and the owner fails to notify the Corporation of that
fact within a reasonable time after the owner has notice of such loss,
apparent destruction or wrongful taking and the Corporation registers a
transfer of such shares before receiving notification, the owner shall be
precluded from asserting against the Corporation any claim for registering
such transfer or a claim to a new certificate representing such shares or such
shares in uncertificated form.

 



 

 **Section 7.6.** ** ****Transfer of Stock.**

 



 

(a) If a certificate representing shares of the Corporation is presented to
the Corporation with an endorsement requesting the registration of transfer of
such shares or an instruction is presented to the Corporation requesting the
registration of transfer of uncertificated shares, the Corporation shall
register the transfer as requested if:

 



 

(i) in the case of certificated shares, the certificate representing such
shares has been surrendered;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) (A) with respect to certificated shares, the endorsement is made by the
person specified by the certificate as entitled to such shares; (B) with
respect to uncertificated shares, an instruction is made by the registered
owner of such uncertificated shares; or (C) with respect to certificated
shares or uncertificated shares, the endorsement or instruction is made by any
other appropriate person or by an agent who has actual authority to act on
behalf of the appropriate person;

 



 

(iii) the Corporation has received a guarantee of signature of the person
signing such endorsement or instruction or such other reasonable assurance
that the endorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized as the
Corporation may request;

 



 

(iv) the transfer does not violate any restriction on transfer imposed by the
Corporation that is enforceable in accordance with _Section 7.8(a)_; and

 



 

(v) such other conditions for such transfer as shall be provided for under
applicable law have been satisfied.

 



 

(b) Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security and
not absolutely, the Corporation shall so record such fact in the entry of
transfer if, when the certificate for such shares is presented to the
Corporation for transfer or, if such shares are uncertificated, when the
instruction for registration of transfer thereof is presented to the
Corporation, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation to do
so.

 



 

 **Section 7.7.** ** ****Registered Stockholders**. Before due presentment
for registration of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the
Corporation or of an instruction requesting registration of transfer of
uncertificated shares, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the
person exclusively entitled to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger
and the other books and records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive
dividends or notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise
all the rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person
who is the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence of
beneficial ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as
are provided under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records
of the Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 7.8.** ** ****Effect of the Corporation s Restriction on
Transfer.**

 



 

(a) A written restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of
shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that
may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by the DGCL and
noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice sent pursuant to _Section
7.2_, may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

 



 

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is

 



      
 

 



 

noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are uncertificated
and such restriction was contained in a notice sent pursuant to _Section
7.2_.

 



 

 **Section 7.9.** ** ****Regulations**. The Board shall have power and
authority to make such additional rules and regulations, subject to any
applicable requirement of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate
with respect to the issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of
stock or certificates representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more
transfer agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that
certificates representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or
registrar so appointed.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

 **Section 8.1.** ** ****Right to Indemnification**. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended,
the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is
made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved
in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " **
_proceeding_** "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director
or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "
** _Indemnitee_** "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action
in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except
as provided in _Section 8.3_ with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

 



 

 **Section 8.2.** ** ****Right to Advancement of Expenses**. In addition to
the right to indemnification conferred in _Section 8.1_, an Indemnitee shall
also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not
prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an " **
_advancement of expenses_** "); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires,
an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as
a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the
Corporations receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an " ** _undertaking_**
"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 8.3.** ** ****Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit**. If a claim
under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ is not paid in full by the Corporation
within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the
Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in
which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled
to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but
not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an
undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that,
the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set
forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee
is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the
applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the
Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this _Article VIII_ or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 8.4.** ** ****Non-Exclusivity of Rights**. The rights provided to
any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be exclusive of any
other right, which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these By Laws, an agreement,
a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

 



 

 **Section 8.5.** ** ****Insurance**. The Corporation may maintain insurance,
at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 8.6.** ** ****Indemnification of Other Persons**. This _Article
VIII_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the
manner authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to
persons other than Indemnitees. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board,
grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any
employee or agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust

 



      
 

 



 

or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit
plan, to the fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VIII_ with
respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees
under this _Article VIII_.

 



 

 **Section 8.7.** ** ****Amendments**. Any repeal or amendment of this
_Article VIII_ by the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by
changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these By
Laws inconsistent with this _Article VIII_, will, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or
change in applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted
prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right
or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision;
provided however, that amendments or repeals of this _Article VIII_ shall
require the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 65% of the
voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 8.8.** ** ****Certain Definitions**. For purposes of this _Article
VIII_, (a) references to "other enterprise" shall include any employee benefit
plan; (b) references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to "serving at
the request of the Corporation" shall include any service that imposes duties
on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit
plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good
faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed
to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest of the
Corporation" for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.

 



 

 **Section 8.9.** ** ****Contract Rights**. The rights provided to
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be contract rights and such
rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director,
officer, agent or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees
heirs, executors and administrators.

 



 

 **Section 8.10.** ** ****Severability**. If any provision or provisions of
this _Article VIII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of this
_Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 9.1.** ** ****Place of Meetings**. If the place of any meeting of
stockholders, the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required
under these By Laws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such
meeting shall be held at the principal business office of the Corporation;
provided, however, if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a

 



       
 

 



 

meeting shall not be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of
remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting
shall not be held at any place.

 



 

 **Section 9.2.** ** ****Fixing Record Dates.**

 



 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the
Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on
or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.2(a)_ at the
adjourned meeting.

 



 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

 **Section 9.3.** ** ****Means of Giving Notice.**

 



 

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By Laws notice is required to be given to any director,
such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a
nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile
telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral
notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director will be deemed
given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by telephone, when
actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the United States
mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon
prepaid, addressed to the director at the directors address appearing on the
records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a
nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such
service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the
directors address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if sent
by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission number
for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if sent by
electronic mail, when sent to the

 



      
 

 



 

electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission,
when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director
appearing on the records of the Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Electronic Transmission_. " ** _Electronic transmission_** " means any
form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of
paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a
recipient through an automated process.

 



 

(c) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the manner
by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation to
stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws shall
be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an
address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such
notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholders consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

 



 

(d) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that
the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to
all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom
communication is unlawful.

 



 

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, to
any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of
action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or
(2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends
or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed
to such stockholder at such stockholders address as shown on the records of
the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such
notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or meeting that
shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same
force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any such
stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth
such stockholders then current address, the requirement that notice be given
to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action taken by
the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the
Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was
not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to
Section 230 (b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection (1) of the first
sentence of this paragraph to the

 



      
 

 



 

requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice
returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission.

 



 

 **Section 9.4.** ** ****Waiver of Notice**. Whenever any notice is required
to be given under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these
By Laws, a written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons
entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person
entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
shall be deemed equivalent to such required notice. Attendance at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a person
attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.

 



 

 **Section 9.5.** ** ****Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication
Equipment.**

 



 

(a) _Stockholder Meetings_. If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion,
and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt,
stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication:

 



 

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

 



 

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to
vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy
holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide
such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an
opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially
concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder
votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a
record of such votes or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By Laws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the
meeting.

 



 

 **Section 9.6.** ** ****Dividends**. The Board may from time to time
declare, and the Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or
shares of the Corporations capital stock) on the Corporations outstanding
shares of capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of
Incorporation.

 



 

 **Section 9.7.** ** ****Reserves**. The Board may set apart out of the funds
of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any
proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 9.8.** ** ****Contracts and Negotiable Instruments**. Except as
otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By Laws, any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument
may be executed and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by
such officer or officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as
the Board may from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or
confined to specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of the
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any
contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on
behalf of the Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board,
the Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to
execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other
instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or
employees of the Corporation under such persons supervision and authority, it
being understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve
such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such delegated
power.

 



 

 **Section 9.9.** ** ****Fiscal Year**. The fiscal year of the Corporation
shall be fixed by the Board.

 



 

 **Section 9.10.** ** ****Seal**. The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which
shall be in such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing
it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced.

 



 

 **Section 9.11.** ** ****Books and Records**. The books and records of the
Corporation may be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place
or places as may from time to time be designated by the Board.

 



 

 **Section 9.12.** ** ****Resignation**. Any director, committee member or
officer may resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic
transmission to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the
President or the Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time it
is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an
effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. Unless
otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be
necessary to make it effective.

 



 

 **Section 9.13.** ** ****Surety Bonds**. Such officers, employees and agents
of the Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer, President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded
for the faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control belonging
to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may
determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and the
bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.

 



 

 **Section 9.14.** ** ****Securities of Other Corporations**. Powers of
attorney, proxies, waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other
instruments relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in
the name of and on behalf of the Corporation by the

 



      
 

 



 

Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, or any officers
authorized by the Board. Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf
of the Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem

 _AGREEMENT_

 



 

1. **_Purchase of Warrants by the Company_ _._** Commencing upon the date hereof and until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the date that is nine (9) months from the Closing Date (the " _Purchase Deadline_ "), the Company will purchase, in the aggregate and at such times in its sole discretion, ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in Public Warrants in the open market at a purchase price per whole Public Warrant of no more than $1.25 per whole Public Warrant; _provided_ that in the event that the Company shall not have purchased Public Warrants in such aggregate dollar amount immediately prior to the Purchase Deadline, the Sponsor may, at its option, sell to the Company Private Placement Warrants at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant

      
 

 



 

to satisfy such obligation (any such purchased Warrants, the " _Purchased
Warrants_ "); _provided further_ that in no event shall the Company be
obligated to purchase more than 10,000,000 Warrants in total. The Purchased
Warrants shall be cancelled and terminated by the Company.

 



 

2. **_Issuance of Warrants to TDCC_. **The Company shall issue warrants to purchase shares of the Common Stock to TDCC representing sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the Purchased Warrants (rounded up to the next whole Warrant), at no cost to TDCC and on terms and conditions that are identical to the Public Warrants (the " _TDCC Warrants_ "), no later than the Purchase Deadline.

 



 

3. **_Make-Up Warrants_. **In the event that the Company has not issued to TDCC an aggregate of 6,000,000 TDCC Warrants on or prior to the Purchase Deadline, (a) the Sponsor will transfer to the Company, at no cost to the Company, the number of Warrants equal to one-half (1/2) of the difference between (i) 6,000,000 and (ii) the number of TDCC Warrants issued by the Company to TDCC on or prior to the Purchase Deadline (the difference between _clause (i)_ and _clause (ii)_ being, the " _Make-Up Warrant Amount_ ") and such transferred Warrants shall be cancelled and terminated by the Company and (b) the Company will issue such number of TDCC Warrants equal to the Make-Up Warrant Amount. From the date hereof until the Purchase Deadline, none of Sponsor and its Affiliates will purchase or otherwise acquire (including through any hedging transaction) any Public Warrants or any rights therein.

 



 

4. **_Miscellaneous_.**

 



 

(a) _Entire Agreement_ _._ Subject to the applicable provisions of the
Purchase Agreement, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements,
arrangements and understandings, written or oral, between the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

(b) _Further Assurances_. On and after the execution of this Agreement, each
party hereto shall execute and deliver to any other party such documents,
agreements and other instruments as may be reasonably requested by such other
party and are required to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Amendments and Waivers_ _._ This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.
The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require performance of
any provision hereof or claim damages with respect thereto shall in no manner
affect its right at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of
any condition or of any breach of any term or covenant contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless it is in a writing signed by such Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Severability_ _._ If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of
the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

 



 

(f) _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by .pdf file exchanged via email or other electronic
transmission), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
