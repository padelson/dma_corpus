10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the SEC Documents, at the time
filed (or in the case of registration statements, solely on the dates of
effectiveness), except to the extent corrected by a subsequent SEC Document,
(a) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made
in the case of any such documents other than a registration statement, not

 



     

 

 



 

misleading and (b) complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case

Section 3.16 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The historical financial statements and schedules of the Partnership
(together with its consolidated or combined subsidiaries) included in or
incorporated by reference in the SEC Documents present fairly the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the entities purported to
be shown thereby on the basis stated therein as of the dates and for the
periods indicated, comply as to form with the applicable accounting
requirements under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP in the United States applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved (except as otherwise noted therein). The
other financial information of the Partnership Entities, including non-GAAP
financial measures, if any, contained or incorporated by reference in the SEC
Documents has been derived from the accounting records of the Partnership
Entities and fairly presents in all material respects the information
purported to be shown thereby. Nothing has come to the attention of the
Partnership that has caused it to believe that the statistical and market-
related data included in the SEC Documents is not based on or derived from
sources that are reliable and accurate in all material respects as of the date
of such information. There are no financial statements (historical or pro
forma) that are required to be included in or incorporated by reference in the
SEC Documents that are not so included as required; the Partnership Entities
do not have any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent
(including any off balance sheet obligations), not described in the SEC
Documents; and all disclosures contained in the SEC Documents regarding "non-
GAAP financial measures" (as such term is defined by the rules and regulations
of the Commission) comply with Regulation G and Item 10 of Regulation S-K
under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable.

 



 

(b) Since the date of the most recent balance sheet of the Partnership audited
by the Partnerships auditor, (i) the interactive data in eXtensible Business
Reporting Language included or incorporated by reference in the SEC Documents
fairly presents the information called for in all material respects and has
been prepared in accordance with the Commissions rules and guidelines
applicable thereto in all material respects and (ii) based on an annual
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Partnership is not aware
of (A) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are likely to
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data or (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the internal
controls over financial reporting of the Partnership.

an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the
Partnership as required by the Exchange Act and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned or been

will have fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect to such

agencies or bodies (collectively, " _Governmental Licenses_ ") necessary to
conduct its business in the manner described in the SEC Documents except for
such Governmental Licenses, the failure of which to obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect; the Partnership Entities are and will be in compliance with
the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the
failure to so comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; the Governmental Licenses are and
will be valid and in full force and effect, except where the invalidity of

have a Material Adverse Effect.

(taking into account any extensions of time within which to file) all foreign,
federal, state and local Tax Returns that are required to be filed, which Tax

payable (whether or not shown to be due pursuant to such Tax Returns) other
than (i) those currently being contested in good faith for which adequate
reserves have been established or (ii) those which, if not paid or filed,

audits, examinations, investigations, actions, suits, claims or other
proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in
writing with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Partnership Entities, and
no deficiencies with respect to Taxes have been asserted in writing against

Code.

 



 

Section 3.24 _Labor and Employment Matters_. No labor disturbance by or

Knowledge of the Partnership, is contemplated or threatened, and to the
Knowledge of the Partnership, there is no existing or imminent labor

manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal,
transportation or handling of, or exposure to, Hazardous Materials
(collectively, " _Environmental Laws_ ");

 



 

(b) with respect to the ownership and operation of their properties and Assets
and the conduct of their business, the Partnership Entities have obtained and
maintained all permits, licenses, registrations, authorizations and approvals
required or issued under applicable Environmental Laws (collectively, "
_Environmental Permits_ ") and are and since January 1, 2016 have been in
compliance with the requirements thereof;

 



 

(c) none of the Partnership Entities have received written notice of any
actual or alleged violation of or liability under any Environmental Law, or
are subject to any pending or threatened administrative, regulatory or
judicial actions, suits, demands, demand letters, claims, liens, notices of
noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings under any
Environmental Law against any of the Partnership Entities; and

 



 

(d) the Partnership is not aware of any event or circumstance that has given
rise to, or would form the basis of, an order for clean-up or remediation, or
an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or
agency, or any other liability against or affecting any of the Partnership
Entities relating to Hazardous Materials or Environmental Laws.

 



 

In the ordinary course of their business, the Partnership Entities
periodically review the effect of Environmental Laws on their business,

or operating expenditures required for clean-up, closure of properties or
compliance with

 



     

 

 



 

Environmental Laws, or any Environmental Permits, any related constraints on
operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the

associated costs and liabilities would not, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute a Material Adverse Effect, except as described in or contemplated
in the SEC Documents.

 



 

Section 3.28 _Intellectual Property_. The Partnership Entities own, possess,
license or have other rights to use, on reasonable terms, all patents, patent
applications, trade and service marks, trade and service mark registrations,
trade names, copyrights, licenses, inventions, trade secrets, technology,
know-how and other intellectual property (collectively, the " _Intellectual
Property_ ") necessary for the operations of the Assets as now conducted or as
proposed in the SEC Documents to be conducted except to the extent that the
failure to own, possess, license or have other rights in such Intellectual

Entity has incurred, nor does any such entity expect to incur, liability under
(a) Title IV of ERISA or (b) Sections 412 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published governmental
interpretations thereunder (the " _Code_ ") with respect to any "pension
plan"; (iv) each "pension plan" for which any Partnership Entity has any
liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is
the subject of a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that it is so qualified and, to the knowledge of
the Partnership Entities, nothing has occurred, whether by action or by
failure to act, which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of or
adversely affect such qualification; (v) no Partnership Entities have incurred
any unpaid liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; and (vi)
there has not been and is not anticipated to be an increase in the aggregate
amount of costs related to the benefits provided with respect to current or
former employees of, or leased or seconded to, the Partnership Entities
compared to such costs for the most recently completed fiscal year (including
the cost of any post-retirement benefit obligations).

 



 

Section 3.31 _No Changes or Material Adverse Effect_. Since the date of the
latest audited financial statements included in the SEC Documents, (a) none of
the Partnership Entities has sustained any loss or interference with its
business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered
by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action,

 



     

 

 



 

investigation, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in
the SEC Documents and other than as would not reasonably be likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially interfere with or delay the
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the SEC
Documents, in each case excluding any amendments or supplements to the
foregoing made after the execution of this Agreement, there has not been (i)
any material adverse change, or any development involving, individually or in
the aggregate, a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the
condition (financial or otherwise), management, earnings, business or
properties of the Partnership Entities taken as a whole, whether or not
arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as
described in the SEC Documents (exclusive of any supplement thereto) or (ii)
any dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by any
Partnership Entity, in each case, other than as described in the SEC Documents

warranties that address matters as of particular dates, shall have been true
and correct as of such dates (giving effect to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in the Eureka Purchase Agreement) and similar qualifiers).
To the Knowledge of the Partnership, all of the representations and warranties
made by North Haven Infrastructure Partners II Buffalo Holdings, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, in the Eureka Purchase Agreement as of the

order to obtain any required consent or approval or other clearance.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Use of Proceeds_. The Partnership shall use the proceeds
received from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to fund
a portion of the Acquisition, including payment of certain fees and expenses
related to the Acquisition and for general partnership purposes.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Lock-Up Agreement_. Without the prior written consent of the
Partnership, except as specifically provided in this Agreement, no Purchaser
shall, (i) during the period commencing on the date that is 15 days prior to
the Closing Date and ending 12 months after the Closing Date, offer, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Purchased Units
or, (ii) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending 24 months
after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly engage in any short sales of
equity securities of the Partnership or other derivative or hedging
transactions with equity securities of the Partnership, that are designed to,
or that might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer to another
Person, in whole or in part, of any of the economic consequences of ownership
of the Purchased Units; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Purchaser may pledge
all or any portion of its Purchased Units to any holders of obligations owed
by such Purchaser, including to the trustee for, or Representative of, such
holders; _provided_ , _further_ , that a Purchaser may transfer any of the
Purchased Units purchased hereunder to (a) an Affiliate of such Purchaser (b)
any other Purchaser or (c) any other Person reasonably acceptable to the
Partnership solely to the extent necessary to address a Regulatory Concern
with respect to such Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, provided that, in any
case, any such transferee agrees to the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.05_ and the Amended Partnership Agreement, and so long as such
transfer complies with the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and
applicable federal and state securities Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.05_, each Purchaser shall be permitted to pledge
all or any portion of its Purchased Units (including any Conversion Units into
which the Purchased Units may convert) in connection with a Permitted Loan,
and neither (A) the foreclosure of any such pledged Purchased Units or
Conversion Units, as the case may be, nor (B) the transfer of Purchased Units
or Conversion Units, as the case may be, by a pledgee or counterparty who has
foreclosed or exercised remedies or rights on any such pledged or transferred
Purchased Units or Conversion Units shall be considered a violation or breach
of this _Section 5.05_. The Purchaser shall provide written notice to the
Partnership of any such pledge (and any foreclosure of such pledged Purchased
Units or Conversion Units) promptly (and in any event) within three Business
Days of making such pledge (or becoming aware of any such foreclosure).

 



 

Section 5.06 _Transfer Taxes_. The Partnership shall be responsible for any
transfer Taxes or other similar Taxes required to be paid and shall comply
with all laws imposing such Taxes and any applicable reporting requirements,
in each case, in connection with the sale of the Purchased Units by the
Partnership to the Purchasers.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
INDEMNIFICATION, COSTS AND EXPENSES**

 



 

Section 6.01 _Indemnification by the Partnership_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, the Partnership agrees to indemnify each
Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, " _Purchaser
Related Parties_ ") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
losses, actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation
or inquiries), demands and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and
promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all reasonable costs,
losses, liabilities, Taxes, damages, or expenses of any kind or nature
whatsoever, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such
matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve any of
them, whether or not involving a third party claim, as a result of, arising
out of, or in any way related to the breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Partnership contained herein; provided, that
any such claim for indemnification relating to a breach of any representation
or warranty is made prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty
(it being understood that (x) for purposes of determining when an
indemnification claim has been made, the date upon which a Purchaser Related
Party has given notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim
for indemnification) to the Partnership shall constitute the date upon which
such claim has been made and (y) the aggregate liability of the Partnership
(i) to each Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall not exceed the
amount of such Purchasers respective Funding Obligation and (ii) to all
Purchasers pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall not exceed the Total Funding
Obligation); provided, further, that no Purchaser Related Party shall be
entitled to recover special, indirect, exemplary, incidental, lost profits,
speculative or punitive damages.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Indemnification by the Purchasers_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Agreement, each Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly,
to indemnify the Partnership, the General Partner and their respective
Representatives (collectively, " _Partnership Related Parties_ ") from, and
hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses, actions, suits,
proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or inquiries), demands
and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and promptly upon demand,
pay or reimburse each of them for all reasonable costs, losses, liabilities,
damages, or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or
preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted
against or involve any of them, whether or not involving a third party claim,
as a result of, arising out of, or in any way related to the breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of such Purchaser contained
herein; provided, that such claim for indemnification relating to a breach of
any representation or warranty is made prior to the expiration of such
representation or warranty (it being understood that (x) for purposes of
determining when an indemnification claim has been made, the date upon which a
Partnership Related Party has given notice (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of the claim for indemnification) to such Purchaser shall constitute the
date upon which such claim has been made and (y) the liability of each such
Purchaser shall not exceed the amount equal to the sum of such Purchasers
respective Funding Obligation, plus any distributions paid to such Purchaser
with respect to the Purchased Units and any Conversion Units); provided,
further, that no Partnership

 



     

 

 



 

Related Party shall be entitled to recover special, indirect, exemplary,
incidental, speculative or punitive damages.

 



 

Section 6.03 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after any Partnership Related Party or Purchaser Related Party
(hereinafter, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") discovers facts giving rise to a
claim for indemnification hereunder, including receipt by it of notice of any
indemnifiable claim hereunder, or the commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding by a third Person, which the Indemnified Party believes in good
faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
shall give the indemnitor hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written
notice of such claim or the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding.
Failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim
to the extent then known and shall include a formal demand for indemnification
under this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend
and settle any such matter, at its own expense and by its own counsel
(provided that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party), as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in
good faith. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend or settle such
claim, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do
so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof and
the settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be
limited to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and
other information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the
Indemnified Partys possession or control. Such cooperation of the Indemnified
Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. After the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to
defend or settle any such matter, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party
diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with any defense or settlement of such asserted liability;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (i) at its
expense, to participate in the defense of such matter and the negotiations of
the settlement thereof and (ii) if (A) the Indemnifying Party has failed to
assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of when the Indemnified Party has provided
written notice of the claim for indemnification or (B) if the defendants in
any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from
or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the
interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and
fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation
to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, includes a complete release from liability of, and does not
contain any admission of wrongdoing by, the Indemnified Party.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any third party indemnity claim (but shall
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
Indemnified Party in defending such third party indemnity claim) if the third
party indemnity claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or
relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party which the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such
equitable relief or other relief portion of the third party indemnity claim
can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.

 



 

Section 6.04 _Survival of Provisions_. All the provisions of this Agreement
shall survive the Closing, notwithstanding any investigation at any time made
by or on behalf of any party hereto; provided, that the representations and
warranties set forth in Article III and Article IV shall terminate and expire
on the date that is 60 days following the date on which the Partnership files
with the Commission its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019,
except (a) the representations and warranties of the Partnership set forth in
_Section 3.01_ (Formation and Qualification of the Partnership Entities),
_Section 3.02_ (Power and Authority of the General Partner), _Section 3.03_
(Ownership of the General Partner Interest), _Section 3.04_ (Capitalization),
_Section 3.08_ (Authority and Authorization), _Section 3.09_ (Authorization
of this Agreement), _Section 3.11_ (Organizational Documents), _Section
3.26_ (Distribution Restrictions), _Section 3.37_ (No Unlawful Payment),
_Section 3.38_ (Money Laundering Laws), _Section 3.39_ (No Conflicts with
Sanctions Laws), _Section 3.42_ (Form S-3 Eligibility), _Section 3.43_
(Certain Fees), _Section 3.44_ (NYSE Listing) and _Section 3.45_ (MLP
Status) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive
indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties of each Purchaser set
forth in _Section 4.01_ (Existence), _Section 4.02_ (Authority) and _Section
4.04_ (Certain Fees) shall survive indefinitely. After a representation and
warranty has terminated and expired, no indemnification shall or may be sought
pursuant to this _Article VI_ on the basis of that representation and
warranty by any Person who would have been entitled pursuant to this _Article
VI_ to indemnification on the basis of that representation and warranty prior
to its termination and expiration; provided, that in the case of each
representation and warranty that shall terminate and expire as provided in
this _Section 6.04_, no claim presented in writing for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VI_ on the basis of that representation and
warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be affected in any way
by that termination and expiration. The covenants or agreements entered into
pursuant to this Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until such covenant or
agreement is fully performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 7.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior

(a) by mutual written consent of the Partnership and a Purchaser, with respect
to itself but not any other Purchaser;

 



      

 

 



 

(b) by either the Partnership or a Purchaser, with respect to itself but not
any other Purchaser, if (i) any Governmental Authority with lawful

(c) by the Partnership, with respect to a Purchaser, if (i) there shall have
been a breach of any representation or warranty of such Purchaser set forth in
this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, or if any such
representation or warranty of such Purchaser shall have become untrue, in
either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 2.05_ would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Closing Date or (ii) there shall have been
a breach in any material respect by such Purchaser of any of its covenants or
agreements hereunder, and with respect to clause (i) or (ii) such Purchaser
shall have not cured such breach or inaccuracy within 30 days after receipt of
written notice thereof from the Partnership; provided, however, that the
Partnership is not then in breach of any of its obligations hereunder;

 



 

(d) by a Purchaser, with respect to itself but not any other Purchaser, if (i)
there shall have been a breach of any representation or warranty of the
Partnership set forth in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document,
or if any such representation or warranty of the Partnership shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 2.04_
would be incapable of being satisfied by the Closing Date or (ii) there shall
have been a breach in any material respect by the Partnership of any of its
covenants or agreements hereunder, and with respect to clause (i) or (ii) the

(e) by either the Partnership or a Purchaser, with respect to itself but not
any other Purchaser, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the earlier to
occur of (i) the Outside Date (as defined in the Eureka Purchase Agreement),
as may be extended in accordance with the terms of Section 9.01(e) of the
Eureka Purchase Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall
provide prompt written notice to the Purchasers of any such extension of the
Outside Date and (ii) August 15, 2019.

 



 

Section 7.02 _Certain Effects of Termination_. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_:

 



 

(a) except as set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_, this Agreement shall become
null and void and have no further force or effect, but the parties shall not
be released from any liability arising from or in connection with any breach
hereof occurring prior to such termination; and

 



 

(b) regardless of any purported termination of this Agreement, the provisions
of _Article VI_ and all indemnification rights and obligations of the
Partnership and the Purchasers thereunder, this _Section 7.02_ and the
provisions of _Article VIII_ shall remain operative and in full force and
effect as between the Partnership and the Purchasers, unless the Partnership
and the Purchasers execute a writing that expressly (with specific references
to the applicable Articles, Sections or

 



     

 

 



 

subsections of this Agreement) terminates such rights and obligations as
between the Partnership and the Purchasers.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 8.01 _Expenses_. At the Closing, the Partnership shall (i) pay to each
Lead Purchaser out of the proceeds received from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement a structuring fee equal to 0.5% of
such Lead Purchasers respective Funding Obligation set forth on _Schedule 1_
(the " _Structuring Fee_ ") and (ii) pay to each Purchaser (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, each Lead Purchaser) out of the proceeds received from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement a transaction
fee equal to 1.5% of such Purchasers respective Funding Obligation set forth
on _Schedule 1_ (the " _Transaction Fee_ "). Each of the Structuring Fee and
the Transaction Fee will be made by netting the amount of such Structuring Fee
or Transaction Fee, as applicable, from the Funding Obligation of each
respective Purchaser at the Closing. For United States federal income tax
purposes, payment of each of the Structuring Fee and the Transaction Fee is,
and will be treated by the parties as, an adjustment to the respective Funding
Obligation paid by the Purchasers for the Purchased Units. In addition, the
Partnership will pay the reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of the
primary outside lead legal counsel and one regulatory counsel incurred by the
Purchasers collectively in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that the Partnerships obligations pursuant to this
sentence shall not exceed $300,000; provided, further, that the expense
reimbursement described in this sentence shall not apply if a Purchaser has
breached, failed to perform or violated in any material respect any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement and this Agreement is
terminated prior to Closing pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)_. Each party will
otherwise be responsible for its own out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 8.02 _Interpretation_. Article, Section and Exhibit references herein
refer to articles and sections of, or exhibits to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified. All Exhibits to this Agreement are hereby incorporated
and made a part hereof as if set forth in full herein and are an integral part
of this Agreement. All references to instruments, documents, contracts, and
agreements are references to such instruments, documents, contracts, and
agreements as the same may be amended, supplemented and otherwise modified
from time to time, unless otherwise specified. The word "including" shall mean
"including but not limited to." Whenever any party has an obligation under the
Transaction Documents, the expense of complying with that obligation shall be
an expense of the Purchasers unless otherwise specified. Any reference in this
Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars. If any provision in the Transaction
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid, not binding, or unenforceable, such
provision shall be fully severable and the applicable Transaction Documents
shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid, not binding, or
unenforceable provision had never comprised a part thereof, and the remaining
provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed so as
to give effect to the original intent of the parties as closely as possible.
When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following
which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to the Transaction
Documents, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the
period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any words
imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa.
Words

 



     

 

 



 

such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision of this Agreement in
which such words appear, unless the context otherwise requires. Article and
Section headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and
shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement.
This Agreement has been reviewed and negotiated by sophisticated parties with
access to legal counsel and shall not be construed against the drafter.

 



 

Section 8.03 _No Waiver; Modifications in Writing_.

 



 

(a) _Delay_. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any remedies that may be available to a party at Law or in equity or
otherwise.

 



 

(b) _Specific Waiver_. Except as otherwise provided herein, no amendment,
waiver, consent, modification or termination of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless signed by the Partnership and each of the
Lead Purchasers; _provided_ , that no amendment or other modification of any
Purchasers Funding Obligation shall be effective unless consented to in
writing by such Purchaser. Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to
any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the Partnership or a Purchaser
from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which such amendment,
supplement, modification, waiver or consent has been made or given.

 



 

(c) _Additional Purchasers_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section
8.03_, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
the Partnership may, with prior written consent of each of the Lead
Purchasers, issue and sell additional Series A Preferred Units to additional
purchasers that execute a Joinder to this Agreement in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Additional Purchasers_ "), and Schedule 1 shall
be deemed to have been amended to reflect the Additional Purchasers and the
corresponding number of Purchased Units to be purchased by such Additional
Purchaser.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 



 

(a) _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Partnership,
each of the Purchasers and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be
construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Prior to the Closing, any Purchaser may transfer its rights to
purchase Purchased Units to an Affiliate of such Purchaser _;_ provided, that
any assignment made pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ shall consist of the
right and related obligations to purchase Purchased Units in an amount not
less than $50 million (based on the Purchase Price) and (b) any assignee of
the Purchasers rights pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ must execute and
deliver to the Partnership at the Closing a Joinder Agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. If, and only if, such assignee consummates
the purchase at the Closing, then concurrently with the Closing, the assignor
shall be released in full from its obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the assigned portion of the Purchased

 



     

 

 



 

Units and the assignee shall be considered a Purchaser hereunder with respect
to such portion of the Purchased Units. Prior to and until the Closing occurs,
the assignor shall remain fully responsible for its obligations under the
Agreement, notwithstanding any execution of a Joinder Agreement by the
assignee. In the event of any such assignment, _Schedule 1_ shall be amended
to reflect the assignee as an additional or alternate Purchaser and the
corresponding number of Purchased Units to be purchased by such assignee.
Without the written consent of the Partnership, no portion of the rights and
obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement may be assigned or
transferred by the Purchaser or any transferee of Purchased Units to a Person
that is not an Affiliate of the Purchaser.

 



 

(b) _Assignment_. No portion of the rights and obligations of the Partnership
under this Agreement may be transferred or assigned (including by merger or
operation of law) without the prior written consent of the Lead Purchasers.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 8.05_, each Purchaser shall, and
shall direct its Affiliates and its Representatives (each, a " _Restricted
Person_ ") to, for a period of two years after the Closing, or if the Closing
does not occur, for a period of two years after the date hereof, maintain the
confidentiality of, and not disclose, trade or otherwise divulge any
Confidential Information provided to or known by such Restricted Person.

 



 

(b) If any Restricted Person is requested or required to disclose any
Confidential Information under applicable Law, regulation (including stock
exchange regulations) or by an order, decree or rule of any Governmental
Authority, the disclosing Restricted Person shall give prompt advance written
notice to the Partnership before the time of disclosure to allow the
Partnership an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy (in each case, at the Partnerships cost), or provide a limited waiver
of compliance with the prohibition against unauthorized disclosure, and
otherwise shall disclose only that limited portion of the Confidential
Information as is required by such applicable Law, regulation, order, decree
or rule; provided, however, that such disclosing Restricted Person shall
reasonably cooperate with the Partnership (at the Partnerships cost) in its
efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.05_, the
Confidential Information may be disclosed, without notice, to the extent such
Restricted Person is requested or required to disclose Confidential
Information to the applicable regulatory authorities or self-regulatory
organizations having supervisory jurisdiction over such Restricted Person
during the course of any routine regulatory audit or examination.

 



 

(c) If the Closing does not occur for any reason, then (i) for a period of two
years after the date hereof, each Restricted Person agrees that all
Confidential Information will remain confidential and such Restricted Person
and any Person to whom such Restricted Person has disclosed Confidential
Information will not use the Confidential Information except as permitted by
this Agreement and (ii) each Restricted Person shall promptly return to the
Partnership or destroy all Confidential Information and related materials and
information, including any notes, summaries, compilations, analyses or other
material derived from the inspection or evaluation of such material and
information; provided, that such Restricted Person (a) may retain such copies
as

 



     

 

 



 

required by applicable Law, regulation and promulgated professional standards,
which copies shall remain subject to clause (i), and (b) will not be required
to destroy electronic versions of the Confidential Information which have been
created pursuant to automatic archiving or back-up procedures to the extent
such destruction is not reasonably practical.

 



 

(d) Other than any Form 8-K to be filed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Partnership Entities and any of their
respective Representatives shall disclose the identity of, or any other
information concerning, any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates only after
providing such Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such disclosure; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.05(d) shall
delay any required filing or other disclosure with the NYSE or any
Governmental Authority or otherwise hinder the Partnership Entities or their
Representatives ability to timely comply with all Laws or rules and
regulations of the NYSE or other Governmental Authority.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Purchaser may disclose Confidential
Information to its and its Affiliates Representatives, Affiliates, funding
sources, limited partners, investors, and potential limited partners or
investors of such Purchaser and its Affiliates who are subject to customary
confidentiality obligations to Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
provisions of this _Section 8.05_ shall apply to, or in any way limit the
activities of, any direct or indirect portfolio company of any Restricted
Person so long as such portfolio company has not received any Confidential
Information. For the avoidance of doubt, no portfolio company shall be deemed
to have received Confidential Information solely because an employee of a
Restricted Person also serves as a director, officer, or functions in a
similar oversight role at, such portfolio company (any such employee, a "
_Dual-Role Individual_ ") so long as such Dual-Role Individual does not
disclose Confidential Information to such portfolio company, including
directors, officers or employees of such portfolio company (other than to
compliance personnel of such portfolio company solely for compliance
purposes).

hereof or (B) the termination of this Agreement by any Purchaser with respect
to such Purchaser pursuant to _Article VII_.

 



 

Section 8.07 _Removal of Legend_. In connection with a sale of the Purchased
Units or Conversion Units by a Purchaser in reliance on Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act, the applicable Purchaser or its broker shall deliver
to the Partnership and its transfer agent a broker representation letter
providing to the Partnership and its transfer agent any information the
Partnership deems necessary to determine that such sale is made in compliance
with Rule 144, including, as may be appropriate, a certification that the
applicable Purchaser is not an Affiliate of the Partnership and regarding the
length of time the Purchased Units or Conversion Units have been held. Upon
receipt of such representation letter, the Partnership shall promptly direct
its transfer agent to remove the legend referred to in _Section 4.06(e)_ from
the appropriate book-entry accounts maintained by the transfer agent, and the
Partnership shall bear all costs associated therewith (including paying the
reasonable customary cost of any legal opinion required by the transfer agent
to be rendered in connection with the removal of such legend). After a
Purchaser or its permitted assigns have held the Purchased Units or Conversion
Units for such time as non-Affiliates are permitted to sell without the
requirement for the Partnership to be in compliance with the current public
information required under Rule 144(c)(1) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable)
as to such Purchased Units or Conversion Units and without volume or manner of
sale restrictions

 



     

 

 



 

under Rule 144, if the book-entry accounts for such Purchased Units or
Conversion Units still bear the restrictive legend referred to in _Section
4.06(e)_, the Partnership agrees, upon request of such Purchaser or permitted
assignee, to take all steps necessary to promptly effect the removal of the
legend described in _Section 4.06(e)_ therefrom, and the Partnership shall
bear all costs associated therewith (including paying the reasonable customary
cost of any legal opinion required by the transfer agent to be rendered in
connection with the removal of such legend), regardless of whether the request
is made in connection with a sale or otherwise, so long as such Purchaser or
its permitted assigns provide to the Partnership any information the
Partnership deems necessary to determine that the legend is no longer required
under the Rules and Regulations or applicable state laws, including a
certification that the holder is not an Affiliate of the Partnership (and a
covenant to inform the Partnership if it should thereafter become an Affiliate
and to consent to the placing of an appropriate restrictive legend on the
applicable Purchased Units in such case) and regarding the length of time the
Purchased Units or Conversion Units have been held. The Partnership shall
cooperate with the Purchasers to effect the removal of the legend referred to
in _Section 4.06(e)_ at any time such legend is no longer appropriate.

 



 

Section 8.08 _DTC Eligibility_. The Partnership will cooperate with the
Purchasers and use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Purchased
Units to be eligible for clearance and settlement through the facilities of
DTC by the earlier of the second anniversary of Closing Date or the time by
which the Purchased Units have been registered under the Securities Act.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Entire Agreement; Disclaimer of Reliance_. This Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents and the other agreements and documents referred to
herein are intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement
and are intended to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and

any Purchaser has relied upon, restrictions, promises, warranties or
undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein or in the other
Transaction Documents with respect to the rights and obligations of the
Partnership, the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates hereunder or
thereunder, and each of the Partnership and the Purchasers expressly disclaims
that it is owed any duties or is entitled to any remedies not expressly set
forth in this Agreement or the Amended Partnership Agreement. This Agreement,
the Transaction Documents and the other agreements and documents referred to
herein or therein supersede all prior agreements and understandings between

all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution,

representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws that might otherwise require the application
of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any action against any party relating
to the foregoing shall be brought in any federal or state court of competent
jurisdiction located within the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court located within the State of Delaware over any such action. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any

 



     

 

 



 

objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. The sole and exclusive remedy for any and all
claims arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be the rights of indemnification set forth in

recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of
such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and
released by the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or otherwise restrict a fraud claim brought by either
party hereto.

 



 

Section 8.13 _No Recourse Against Others_.

 



 

(a) All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be

with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement),
may be made only against (and are expressly limited to) the Partnership and
the Purchasers. No Person other than the Partnership or the Purchasers,
including no member, partner, stockholder, unitholder, Affiliate or
Representative thereof, nor any member, partner, stockholder, unitholder,
Affiliate or Representative of any of the foregoing, shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,

Law, each of the Partnership and each Purchaser hereby waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
third Person.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
(i) the Partnership and each Purchaser hereby waives and releases any and all
rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available
at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity
form of the other or otherwise impose liability of the other on any third
Person, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency,
control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business

and (ii) the Partnership and each Purchaser disclaims any reliance upon any
third Person with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement.

purposes of _Section 8.10_ only, any member, partner, stockholder,
unitholder, Affiliate or Representative of the Partnership or the Purchasers,

 **WHEREAS,** the General Partner desires to amend and restate the Third
Restated Partnership Agreement in its entirety to provide for a new class of

with the issuance of such securities;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Section 13.1(g) and Section 13.1(m) of the Third Restated
Partnership Agreement provide that the General Partner, without the approval
of any Limited Partners (as defined below), may amend any provision of the
Third Restated Partnership Agreement and execute, swear to, acknowledge,
deliver, file and record whatever documents may be required in connection
therewith, to reflect (a) an amendment that the General Partner determines to
be necessary or appropriate in connection with the authorization or issuance
of any class or series of Partnership Interests pursuant to the General
Partners right under Section 5.6 of the Third Restated Partnership Agreement
to cause the Partnership to issue additional Partnership Interests for any

to the foregoing.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , the General Partner does hereby amend and restate the
Third Restated Partnership Agreement, pursuant to its authority under Section

 **ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS**

 



 

Section 1.1 _Definitions_ _. _The following definitions shall be for all
purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the
terms used in this Agreement.

 



 

" ** _Adjusted Capital Account_** " means the Capital Account maintained for
each Partner as of the end of each taxable period of the Partnership, (a)
increased by any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the
standards set by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is
deemed obligated to restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5)) and (b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and
deductions that, as of the end of such

 



     

 

 



 

taxable period, are reasonably expected to be allocated to such Partner in
subsequent taxable periods under Sections 704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) the amount of all
distributions that, as of the end of such taxable period, are reasonably
expected to be made to such Partner in subsequent taxable periods in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or otherwise to the extent they
exceed offsetting increases to such Partners Capital Account that are
reasonably expected to occur during (or prior to) the taxable period in which
such distributions are reasonably expected to be made (other than increases as
a result of a minimum gain chargeback pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ or
_6.1(d)(ii)_ ). The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is
intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. The
"Adjusted Capital Account" of a Partner in respect of any Partnership Interest
shall be the amount that such Adjusted Capital Account would be if such
Partnership Interest were the only interest in the Partnership held by such
Partner from and after the date on which such Partnership Interest was first
issued.

has been adjusted pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_.

herein, the term "control" means the possession, direct or indirect, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
Person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, for
purposes of this Agreement, no Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be
considered an Affiliate of the Partnership, and no Series A Preferred
Unitholder or any of its Affiliates shall be considered Affiliates of any
other Series A Preferred Unitholder or any of such other Series A Preferred
Unitholders Affiliates, in either case, solely by virtue of such Series A
Preferred Unitholders ownership of the Series A Preferred Units.
Notwithstanding anything in this definition to the contrary, for purposes of
this Agreement, (a) the Partnership Group, on the one hand, and any Series A
Preferred Unitholder, on the other hand, shall not be considered Affiliates
and (b) any fund or account managed, advised or subadvised, directly or
indirectly, by a Series A Preferred Unitholder or its Affiliates, shall be
considered an Affiliate of such Series A Preferred Unitholder.

 



 

" ** _Agreed Allocation_** " means any allocation, other than a Required
Allocation, of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the

" ** _Agreed Value_** " of any Contributed Property means the fair market
value of such property or other consideration at the time of contribution and
in the case of an Adjusted Property, the fair market value of such Adjusted
Property on the date of the Revaluation Event as described in _Section
5.5(d)_, in both cases as determined by the General Partner. The General
Partner shall use such method as it determines to be appropriate to allocate
the aggregate Agreed Value of Contributed Properties contributed to the
Partnership in a single or integrated transaction among each separate property
on a basis proportional to the fair market value of each Contributed Property.

 



     

 

 



 

" ** _Agreement_** " means this Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of EQM Midstream Partners, LP, as it may be amended,
supplemented or restated from time to time.

" ** _Amended Second Restated Partnership Agreement_** " has the meaning given
such term in the recitals.

 



 

" ** _Associate_** " means, when used to indicate a relationship with any
Person, (a) any corporation or organization of which such Person is a
director, officer, manager, member, general partner or managing member or is,
directly or indirectly, the owner of 20% or more of any class of voting stock
or other voting interest, (b) any trust or other estate in which such Person
has at least a 20% beneficial interest or as to which such Person serves as
trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity, and (c) any relative or spouse of
such Person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same principal
residence as such Person.

 



 

" ** _Available Cash_** " means, with respect to any Quarter ending prior to
the Liquidation Date:

Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand at the end of such Quarter;

cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group (or the Partnerships
proportionate share of cash and cash equivalents in the case of Subsidiaries
that are not wholly owned) on hand on the date of determination of Available
Cash with respect to such Quarter resulting from Working Capital Borrowings
made subsequent to the end of such Quarter; _less_

 



 

(b) the amount of any cash reserves established by the General Partner (or the
Partnerships proportionate share of cash reserves in the case of Subsidiaries
that are not wholly owned) to:

 



 

(i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership Group
(including reserves for future capital expenditures, for anticipated future
debt service requirements of the Partnership Group, for the payment of Series
A Quarterly Distributions and for refunds of collected rates reasonably likely
to be refunded as a result of a settlement or hearing relating to FERC rate
proceedings) subsequent to such Quarter;

 



 

(ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement,
mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any Group

one or more of the next four Quarters;

 



     

 

 



 

provided, however, that disbursements made by a Group Member or cash reserves
established, increased or reduced after the end of such Quarter but on or
before the date of determination of Available Cash with respect to such
Quarter shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or reduced,
for purposes of determining Available Cash, within such Quarter if the General
Partner so determines.

" ** _Book-Tax Disparity_** " means with respect to any item of Contributed
Property or Adjusted Property, as of the date of any determination, the
difference between the Carrying Value of such Contributed Property or Adjusted
Property and the adjusted basis thereof for federal income tax purposes as of
such date. A Partners share of the Partnerships Book-Tax Disparities in all
of its Contributed Property and Adjusted Property will be reflected by the
difference between such Partners Capital Account balance as maintained

Capital Account computed as if it had been maintained strictly in accordance
with federal income tax accounting principles.

 



 

" ** _Business Day_** " means Monday through Friday of each week, except that

by such Partner from and after the date on which such Partnership Interest was
first issued.

 



 

" ** _Capital Contribution_** " means (a) any cash, cash equivalents or the
Net Agreed Value of Contributed Property that a Partner contributes to the
Partnership or that is contributed or deemed contributed to the Partnership on
behalf of a Partner (including, in the case of an underwritten offering of

the issuing Person.

 



     

 

 



 

" ** _Carrying Value_** " means (a) with respect to a Contributed Property or
Adjusted Property, the Agreed Value of such property reduced (but not below
zero) by all depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions charged
to the Partners Capital Accounts in respect of such property and (b) with

for federal income tax purposes, all as of the time of determination; provided
that the Carrying Value of any property shall be adjusted from time to time in
accordance with _Sections 5.5(d)(i)_ and _5.5(d)(ii)_ and to reflect

Partnership of the Partnership filed with the Secretary of State of the State

shall be included in the Partnerships name where necessary for the purpose of
complying with the laws of any jurisdiction that so requires. The General

outside the State of Delaware as the General Partner determines to be
necessary or appropriate. The address of the General Partner shall be 625

to be conducted by the Partnership shall be to (a) engage directly in, or

Act and, in connection therewith, to exercise all of the rights and powers
conferred upon the Partnership pursuant to the agreements relating to such
business activity, and (b) do anything necessary or appropriate to further the
foregoing, including the making of capital contributions or loans to a Group
Member; provided, however, that the General Partner shall not cause the
Partnership to engage, directly or indirectly, in any business activity that
the General Partner determines would be reasonably likely to cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation
to propose or approve the conduct by the Partnership of any business and may
decline to do so free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership
or any Limited Partner and, in declining to so propose or approve, shall not
be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated

the conduct by the Partnership of any business shall be permitted to do so in
its sole and absolute discretion.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Powers_ _. _The Partnership shall be empowered to do any and all

assets of the Partnership may be held in the name of the Partnership, the
General Partner, one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees of the
General Partner or its Affiliates, as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any assets of the
Partnership for which record title is held in the name of the General Partner
or one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees of the General
Partner or its Affiliates shall be held by the General Partner or such
Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the General
Partner shall use reasonable efforts to cause record title to such assets
(other than those assets in respect of which the General Partner determines
that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of record title
to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership or one or
more of the Partnerships designated Affiliates as soon as reasonably
practicable; provided, further, that, prior to the withdrawal or removal of
the General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General Partner
shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record title to the
Partnerships assets and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the use
of such assets in a manner satisfactory to any successor General Partner. All
assets of the Partnership shall be

Partnership is held.

Section 3.2 _Management of Business_ _. _No Limited Partner, in its capacity
as such, shall participate in the operation, management or control (within the
meaning of the Delaware Act) of the Partnerships business, transact any
business in the Partnerships name or have the power to sign documents for or
otherwise bind the Partnership. No action taken by any Affiliate of the
General Partner or any officer, director, employee, manager, member, general
partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, or
any officer, director, employee, manager, member, general partner, agent or
trustee of a Group Member, in its capacity as such, shall be deemed to be
participating in the control of the business of the Partnership by a limited
partner of the Partnership (within the meaning of Section 17-303(a) of the
Delaware Act) nor shall any such action affect, impair or eliminate the
limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Rights of Limited Partners_.

 



 

(a) Each Limited Partner shall have the right, for a purpose reasonably
related to such Limited Partners interest as a Limited Partner in the
Partnership, upon reasonable written demand stating the purpose of such
demand, and at such Limited Partners own expense:

 



 

(i) to obtain from the General Partner either (A) copies of the Partnerships
most recent filings with the Commission on Form 10-K and any subsequent
filings on Form 10-Q and 8-K or (B) if the Partnership is no longer subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the information specified in,
and meeting the requirements of, Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act or
any successor or similar rule or regulation under the Securities Act (provided
that the foregoing materials shall be deemed to be available to a Limited
Partner in satisfaction of the requirements of this _Section 3.3(a)(i)_ if
posted on or accessible through the Partnerships or the Commissions
website);

 



 

(ii) to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence
or mailing address of each Partner; and

 



 

(iii) to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited
Partnership and all amendments thereto.

 



 

(b) The rights to information granted the Limited Partners pursuant to
_Section 3.3(a)_ replace in their entirety any rights to information provided
for in Section 17-305(a) of the Delaware Act and each of the Partners and each
other Person or Group who acquires an interest in Partnership Interests hereby
agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law that they do not have any rights
as Partners to receive any information either pursuant to Sections 17-305(a)
of the Delaware Act or otherwise except for the information identified in
_Section 3.3(a)_.

 



      

 

 



 

(c) The General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for
such period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable, (i) any
information that the General Partner determines is in the nature of trade
secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which the General Partner
determines (A) is not in the best interests of the Partnership Group, (B)
could damage the Partnership Group or its business or (C) that any Group
Member is required by law or regulation or by agreement with any third party
to keep confidential (other than agreements with Affiliates of the Partnership
the primary purpose of which is to circumvent the obligations set forth in
this _Section 3.3_).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or Section 17-305 of
the Delaware Act, each of the Partners, each other Person or Group who
acquires an interest in a Partnership Interest and each other Person bound by
this Agreement hereby agrees to the fullest extent permitted by law that they
do not have rights to receive information from the Partnership or any
Indemnitee for the purpose of determining whether to pursue litigation or
assist in pending litigation against the Partnership or any Indemnitee
relating to the affairs of the Partnership except pursuant to the applicable
rules of discovery relating to litigation commenced by such Person or Group.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF PARTNERSHIP 
INTERESTS; REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 4.1 _Certificates_ _. _Owners of Partnership Interests and, where
appropriate, Derivative Partnership Interests, shall be recorded in the
Register and ownership of such interests shall be evidenced by a physical
certificate or book entry notation in the Register. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, unless the General Partner shall determine
otherwise in respect of some or all of any or all classes of Partnership
Interests and Derivative Partnership Interests, Partnership Interests and
Derivative Partnership Interests shall not be evidenced by physical
certificates. Certificates, if any, shall be executed on behalf of the
Partnership by the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer
or any Vice President and the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, or other
authorized officer of the General Partner, and shall bear the legend set forth
in _Section 4.7(f)_, or in the case of Series A Preferred Units, _Section
5.11(b)(iv)_; provided, however, that, in the event the Series A Preferred
Units are not represented by certificates, upon any transfer of Series A
Preferred Units, the transferor of such Series A Preferred Units shall notify
the registered owner of any applicable restrictions on the transfer of the
Series A Preferred Units. The signatures of such officers upon a certificate
may be facsimiles. In case any officer who has signed or whose signature has
been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before
such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Partnership with the same
effect as if he were such officer at the date of its issuance. If a Transfer
Agent has been appointed for a class of Partnership Interests, no Certificate
for such class of Partnership Interests shall be valid for any purpose until
it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; provided, however, that, if
the General Partner elects to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership
Interests of such class in global form, the Certificate shall be valid upon
receipt of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the
Partnership Interests have been duly registered in accordance with the
directions of the Partnership. Subject to the requirements of _Section
6.4(a)_, if Common Units are evidenced by Certificates, on or after the date
on which Class B Units are converted into Common Units pursuant to the terms
of _Section 5.10(c)_, the

 



     

 

 



 

Record Holders of such Class B Units (i) if the Class B Units are evidenced by
Certificates, may exchange such Certificates for Certificates evidencing the
Common Units into which such Record Holders Class B Units converted, or (ii)
if the Class B Units are not evidenced by Certificates, shall be issued
Certificates evidencing the Common Units into which such Record Holders Class
B Units converted. With respect to any Partnership Interests that are
represented by physical certificates, the General Partner may determine that
such Partnership Interests will no longer be represented by physical
certificates and may, upon written notice to the holders of such Partnership
Interests and subject to applicable law, take whatever actions it deems
necessary or appropriate to cause such Partnership Interests to be registered
in book entry or global form and may cause such physical certificates to be
cancelled or deemed cancelled.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates_.

 



 

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the
appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall
execute, and the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange
therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the same number and type of Partnership
Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests as the Certificate so
surrendered.

 



 

(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent shall
countersign, a new Certificate in place of any Certificate previously issued,
if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

 



 

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed
or stolen;

 



 

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the General Partner has
notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good
faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

 



 

(iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a
bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety
or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may direct
to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the
Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged
loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

 



 

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General
Partner or the Transfer Agent.

 



 

If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable
period of time after such Limited Partner has notice of the loss, destruction
or theft of a Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests
represented by the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the
General Partner or the Transfer Agent receives such notification, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited Partner shall be precluded from
making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer
Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate.

 



 

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this _Section
4.2_, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other

 



     

 

 



 

governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent) reasonably
connected therewith.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Record Holders_ _. _The names and addresses of Unitholders as
they appear in the Register shall be the official list of Record Holders of
the Partnership Interests for all purposes. The Partnership and the General
Partner shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the Partner with
respect to any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not be bound to
recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such Partnership
Interest on the part of any other Person or Group, regardless of whether the
Partnership or the General Partner shall have actual or other notice thereof,
except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation,
guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which such
Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading. Without limiting the
foregoing, when a Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or
clearing corporation or an agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as
nominee, agent or in some other representative capacity for another Person or
Group in acquiring and/or holding Partnership Interests, as between the
Partnership on the one hand, and such other Person on the other, such
representative Person shall be the Limited Partner with respect to such
Partnership Interest upon becoming the Record Holder in accordance with
_Section 10.1(b)_ and have the rights and obligations of a Partner hereunder
as, and to the extent, provided herein, including _Section 10.1(c)_.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Transfer Generally_.

 



 

(a) The term "transfer," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction (i) by which
the General Partner assigns all or any part of its General Partner Interest to
another Person, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law or otherwise
or (ii) by which the holder of a Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited
Partner Interest to another Person who is or becomes a Limited Partner as a
result thereof, and includes a sale, assignment, gift, exchange or any other
disposition by law or otherwise, excluding a pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation or mortgage but including any transfer upon foreclosure of any
pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or mortgage.

 



 

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this _Article IV_.
Any transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this _Article IV_ shall be null and void, and the Partnership
shall have no obligation to effect or recognize any such transfer or purported
transfer.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent or limit
a disposition by any stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the
General Partner or any Limited Partner of any or all of such Persons shares
of stock, membership interests, partnership interests or other ownership
interests in the General Partner or such Limited Partner and the term
"transfer" shall not include any such disposition.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 4.5 _Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner shall keep, or cause to be kept by the Transfer Agent
on behalf of the Partnership, one or more registers in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe and subject to the provisions of
_Section 4.5(b)_, the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests,
and any Derivative Partnership Interests as applicable, shall be recorded (the
" ** _Register_** " _)._

 



 

(b) The General Partner shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner
Interests evidenced by Certificates until the Certificates evidencing such
Limited Partner Interests are surrendered for registration of transfer. No
charge shall be imposed by the General Partner for such transfer; provided,
that as a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this _Section
4.5_, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed with respect thereto
and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent)
reasonably connected therewith. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a
Certificate, and subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.5(b)_, the
appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall
execute and deliver, and in the case of Certificates evidencing Limited
Partner Interests for which a Transfer Agent has been appointed, the Transfer
Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the
designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holders
instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate
number and type of Limited Partner Interests as was evidenced by the
Certificate so surrendered. Upon the proper surrender of a Certificate, such
transfer shall be recorded in the Register.

 



 

(c) Upon the receipt by the General Partner of proper transfer instructions
from the Record Holder of uncertificated Partnership Interests, such transfer
shall be recorded in the Register.

 



 

(d) By acceptance of the transfer of any Limited Partner Interests in
accordance with this _Section 4.5_ and except as provided in _Section 4.8_,
each transferee of a Limited Partner Interest (including any nominee holder or
an agent or representative acquiring such Limited Partner Interests for the
account of another Person) acknowledges and agrees to the provisions of
_Section 10.1(b)_.

 



 

(e) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.5_, (ii)
_Section 4.4_, (iii) _Section 4.7_, (iv) with respect to any class or
series of Limited Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement of
designations or an amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or
series, (v) any contractual provisions binding on any Limited Partner and (vi)
provisions of applicable law, including the Securities Act, Limited Partner
Interests shall be freely transferable.

 



 

(f) The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right at any time to
transfer their Class B Units and Common Units (whether issued upon conversion
of the Class B Units or otherwise) to one or more Persons.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Transfer of the General Partner s General Partner Interest_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 4.6(c)_, prior to June 30, 2022, the General Partner
shall not transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest to a Person
unless such transfer (i) has

 



     

 

 



 

been approved by the prior written consent or vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) and Outstanding Series A Preferred Units
(with such Series A Preferred Units to be treated on an as-converted basis as
described in _Section 5.11(b)(v)_), voting together as a single class, or
(ii) is of all, but not less than all, of its General Partner Interest to (A)
an Affiliate of the General Partner (other than an individual) or (B) another
Person (other than an individual) in connection with the merger or
consolidation of the General Partner with or into such other Person or the
transfer by the General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to
such other Person.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.6(c)_, on or after June 30, 2022, the General
Partner may transfer all or any part of its General Partner Interest without
Unitholder approval.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees
to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the
partnership or membership interest of the General Partner as the general
partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group Member. In the case of
a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this _Section 4.6_, the
transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to compliance with
the terms of _Section 10.2_, be admitted to the Partnership as the General
Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of the General Partner
Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue without
dissolution.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Restrictions on Transfers_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 4.7(e)_, notwithstanding the other
provisions of this _Article IV_, no transfer of any Partnership Interests
shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the then applicable federal
or state securities laws or rules and regulations of the Commission, any state
securities commission or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction
over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence or qualification of the
Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, or (iii)
cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation
or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed). The Partnership may issue stop
transfer instructions to any Transfer Agent in order to implement any
restriction on transfer contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if it receives an Opinion of Counsel that such restrictions are
necessary to (i) avoid a significant risk of the Partnerships becoming
taxable as a corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed) or
(ii) preserve the uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or
classes thereof). The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending
this Agreement; provided, however, that any amendment that would result in the
delisting or suspension of trading of any

 



     

 

 



 

class of Limited Partner Interests on the principal National Securities
Exchange on which such class of Limited Partner Interests is then listed or
admitted to trading must be approved, prior to such amendment being effected,
by the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Limited Partner
Interests of such class.

 



 

(c) The transfer of a Class B Unit that has converted into a Common Unit shall
be subject to the restrictions imposed by _Section 6.4(a)_.

 



 

(d) In addition to any other restrictions set forth in this Agreement, the
transfer of a Series A Preferred Unit or a Series A Conversion Unit shall be
subject to the restrictions imposed by _Section 5.11(b)(vii)_ and _Section
6.5_, respectively.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Article IV_, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading.

 



 

(f) Each certificate or book entry evidencing Partnership Interests (other
than the Series A Preferred Units) shall bear a conspicuous legend in
substantially the following form:

 



 

 _THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF EQM MIDSTREAM
PARTNERS, LP THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER (AS
DEFINED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT) WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE
EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP TO BE TREATED AS AN
ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN ENTITY FOR
FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED).
THE GENERAL PARTNER OF EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL
RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF
EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE
BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT
NOT ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED). THIS SECURITY MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
RESTRICTIONS ON ITS TRANSFER PROVIDED IN THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. COPIES OF
SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN REQUEST MADE BY THE
HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS SECURITY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE GENERAL PARTNER AT
THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE
SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY
ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON
WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING._

 



     

 

 



 

Section 4.8 _Eligibility Certificates, Ineligible Holders_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner may upon demand or on a regular basis require Limited
Partners and transferees of Limited Partner Interests in connection with a
transfer, to execute an Eligibility Certificate or provide other information
as is necessary for the General Partner to determine if any such Limited
Partners or transferees are Ineligible Holders.

 



 

(b) If any Limited Partner (or its beneficial owners) falsely certifies its
status as an Eligible Taxable Holder or fails to furnish to the General
Partner within 30 days of its request an Eligibility Certificate and other
information related thereto, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility
Certificate or other requested information the General Partner determines that
a Limited Partner or a transferee of a Limited Partner is an Ineligible
Holder, the Limited Partner Interests owned by such Limited Partner shall be
subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.9_ or
the General Partner may refuse to effect the transfer of the Limited Partner
Interests to such transferee. In addition, the General Partner shall be
substituted for any Limited Partner that is an Ineligible Holder as the
Limited Partner in respect of the Ineligible Holders Limited Partner
Interests.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of
Limited Partner Interests held by it on behalf of Ineligible Holders,
distribute the votes in the same ratios as the votes of Limited Partners
(including the General Partner and its Affiliates) in respect of Limited
Partner Interests other than those of Ineligible Holders are cast, either for,
against or abstaining as to the matter.

 



 

(d) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, an Ineligible Holder shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to _Section 12.4_ but shall
be entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the Partnership shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Ineligible Holders share of any
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Ineligible
Holder of its Limited Partner Interest (representing the right to receive its
share of such distribution in kind).

 



 

(e) At any time after an Ineligible Holder can and does certify that it no
longer is an Ineligible Holder, it may, upon application to the General
Partner, request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such
Ineligible Holder not redeemed pursuant to _Section 4.9_, such Ineligible
Holder upon approval of the General Partner, shall no longer constitute an
Ineligible Holder and the General Partner shall cease to be deemed to be the
Limited Partner in respect of such Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(f) If at any time a transferee of a Partnership Interest fails to furnish an
Eligibility Certificate or any other information requested by the General
Partner pursuant to this _Section 4.8_ within 30 days of such request, or if
upon receipt of such Eligibility Certificate or such other information the
General Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that such transferee
is an Ineligible Holder, the Partnership may, unless the transferee
establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such transferee is
not an Ineligible Holder, prohibit and void the transfer, including by placing
a stop order with the Transfer Agent.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 4.9 _Redemption of Partnership Interests of Ineligible Holders_.

 



 

(a) If at any time a Limited Partner falsely certifies its status as an
Eligible Taxable Holder or fails to furnish an Eligibility Certificate or any
other information requested by the General Partner pursuant to _Section 4.8_
within 30 days of such request, or if upon receipt of such Eligibility
Certificate or such other information the General Partner determines, with the
advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner is an Ineligible Holder, the
Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner establishes to the satisfaction of
the General Partner that such Limited Partner is not an Ineligible Holder or
has transferred his Limited Partner Interests to a Person who is not an
Ineligible Holder and who furnishes an Eligibility Certificate to the General
Partner prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the
Limited Partner Interest of such Limited Partner as follows:

 



 

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner, at his
last address designated in the Register, by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid. The notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed.
The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for
redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be
made upon redemption of the Redeemable Interests (or, if later in the case of
Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon surrender of the
Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests) and that on and after the
date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the
Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable
Interests will accrue or be made.

 



 

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an
amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which
shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the
class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests
of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests. The redemption
price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by
delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of
the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable
in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued
interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

 



 

(iii) The Limited Partner or his duly authorized representative shall be
entitled to receive the payment for the Redeemable Interests at the place of
payment specified in the notice of redemption on the redemption date (or, if
later in the case of Redeemable Interests evidenced by Certificates, upon
surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or transferee at the place
specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing the
Redeemable Interests, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment
duly executed in blank).

 



 

(iv) After the redemption, Redeemable Interests shall no longer constitute
issued and Outstanding Limited Partner Interests.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 4.9_ shall also be applicable to Limited
Partner Interests held by a Limited Partner as nominee, agent or
representative of a Person determined to be an Ineligible Holder.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 4.9_ shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Limited Partner Interest before the
redemption date if such

 



     

 

 



 

transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement and the transferor
provides notice of such transfer to the General Partner. Upon receipt of
notice of such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of
redemption, provided the transferee of such Limited Partner Interest certifies
to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such transferee is not an
Ineligible Holder. If the transferee fails to make such certification within
30 days after the request and, in any event, before the redemption date, such
redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the original redemption
date.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 5.1 _Simplification Transactions_.

 



 

(a) Pursuant to the IDR Merger Agreement, the Former General Partner
transferred, assigned and conveyed to the Partnership all of the Former
General Partners right, title and interest in and to the Incentive
Distribution Rights and agreed to the cancellation of the Incentive
Distribution Rights and the economic portion of the General Partner Interest
(as defined in the Second Restated Partnership Agreement), including as
represented by the General Partner Units, and, in exchange therefor and in
consideration thereof, the Partnership issued 87,000,000 Common Units to the
Former General Partner (such Common Units, the " ** _Exchange Consideration_**
," and such exchange, the " ** _Exchange_** "). Upon the consummation of the
Exchange, pursuant to the IDR Merger Agreement and the First Amendment, the
Incentive Distribution Rights and the economic portion of the General Partner
Interest (as defined in the Second Restated Partnership Agreement), including
as represented by the General Partner Units, were cancelled and,
notwithstanding the Exchange, the General Partner Interest in the Partnership
continued to be outstanding and held by the Former General Partner immediately
following the consummation of the Exchange and the Former General Partner
continued as general partner of the Partnership without interruption. Also, at
such time, the General Partner Interest in the Partnership ceased to be
represented by General Partner Units.

 



 

(b) Immediately following the Exchange and pursuant to the IDR Merger
Agreement, EQGP Services, LLC was admitted as the general partner of the
Partnership and, immediately thereafter, the Former General Partner
transferred, assigned and conveyed the General Partner Interest to the General
Partner and ceased to be a general partner of the Partnership. The Partnership
was continued, and is hereby continued, without dissolution.

 



 

(c) Effective concurrently herewith, immediately following the consummation of
the transfer of the General Partner Interest to the General Partner, Merger
Sub merged with and into EQGP, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased,
and EQGP continued as the surviving limited partnership in such merger and as
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership (the " ** _Merger_** "). In
connection with the Merger, (i) pursuant to the IDR Merger Agreement, all EQGP
Common Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and ceased to be Outstanding in accordance with Section 2.3(c) of the IDR
Merger Agreement at the effective time of the Merger, and concurrently with
the effectiveness of the Third Restated Partnership Agreement, the Partnership
issued the Merger Consideration to EGH, EQM GP Corp and EMH in satisfaction of
its obligations pursuant to the IDR Merger Agreement, which issuances were
authorized and

 



     

 

 



 

approved and (ii) in accordance with the IDR Merger Agreement, the Common
Units constituting the Exchange Consideration and the 21,811,643 Common Units
issued and outstanding and owned by the Former General Partner and EQGP,
respectively, and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger, were cancelled and ceased to be Outstanding.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Contributions by the General Partner and its Affiliates_. Except
as set forth in _Section 12.8_, the General Partner shall not be obligated to
make any Capital Contributions to the Partnership.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Contributions by Limited Partners_. No Limited Partner will be
required to make any additional Capital Contribution to the Partnership
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Interest and Withdrawal_ _. _No interest shall be paid by the
Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if
any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of
the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent
provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in
this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either
as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or
distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners
agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Capital Accounts_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of
Partnership Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any case
in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity of
such beneficial owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of
the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a
Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such
Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). The Capital Account shall in respect of each such
Partnership Interest be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership
Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income
and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_ and
allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to _Section
6.1_, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all
actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such
Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss
computed in accordance with _Section 5.5(b)_ and allocated with respect to
such Partnership Interest pursuant to _Section 6.1_. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Series A Preferred Unit will be treated as a partnership interest
in the Partnership that is "convertible equity" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.721-2(g)(3), and, therefore, each holder of a Series A
Preferred Unit will be treated as a partner in the Partnership. The initial
Capital Account balance in respect of each Series A Preferred Unit issued on
the Series A Issuance Date shall be the Series A Issue Price, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 8.01 of the Series A Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or
deduction that is to be allocated pursuant to _Article VI_ and is to be
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition
and classification of any such item shall be the same as

 



     

 

 



 

its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax
purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for that purpose), provided, that:

 



 

(i) Solely for purposes of this _Section 5.5_, the Partnership shall be
treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the
General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member
Agreement or governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property
owned by (x) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability
company, unincorporated business or other entity classified as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is, directly or
indirectly, a partner, member or other equity holder.

 



 

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the
sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor
amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of
Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time
such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the
Partners pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code that may be made by the Partnership. To the extent an adjustment to
the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain or loss.

 



 

(iv) In the event the Carrying Value of Partnership property is adjusted
pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)_, any Unrealized Gain resulting from such
adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain and any Unrealized Loss
resulting from such adjustment shall be treated as an item of loss.

 



 

(v) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

 



 

(vi) An item of income of the Partnership that is described in Section
705(a)(1)(B) of the Code (with respect to items of income that are exempt from
tax) shall be treated as an item of income for the purpose of this _Section
5.5(b)_, and an item of expense of the Partnership that is described in
Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code (with respect to expenditures that are not
deductible and not chargeable to capital accounts), shall be treated as an
item of deduction for the purpose of this _Section 5.5(b)_.

 



 

(vii) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to _Section
5.5(d)_ to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to
depreciation, cost

 



     

 

 



 

recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost
recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined
under the rules prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d)(2) as if
the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such
property immediately following such adjustment.

 



 

(viii) The Gross Liability Value of each Liability of the Partnership
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7(b)(3)(i) shall be adjusted at
such times as provided in this Agreement for an adjustment to Carrying Values.
The amount of any such adjustment shall be treated for purposes hereof as an
item of loss (if the adjustment increases the Carrying Value of such Liability
of the Partnership) or an item of gain (if the adjustment decreases the
Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership).

 



 

(c)

 



 

(i) The transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a Pro Rata
portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership
Interest so transferred.

 



 

(ii) Subject to _Section 6.4(a)_, immediately prior to the transfer of a
Class B Unit or a Common Unit resulting from the conversion of a Class B Unit
pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_ by a holder thereof (other than a transfer to
an Affiliate unless the General Partner elects to have this _subparagraph
5.5(c)(ii)_ apply), the Capital Account maintained for such Person with
respect to its Class B Units or Converted Class B Units will (A) first, be
allocated to the Class B Units or Converted Class B Units to be transferred in
an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of such Class B Units or
Converted Class B Units to be transferred and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount
for a Common Unit, and (B) second, any remaining balance in such Capital
Account will be retained by the transferor, regardless of whether it has
retained any Class B Units or Converted Class B Units (" ** _Retained
Converted Class B Units_**"). Following any such allocation, the transferors
Capital Account, if any, maintained with respect to the retained Class B Units
or Retained Converted Class B Units, if any, will have a balance equal to the
amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the transferees Capital
Account established with respect to the transferred Class B Units or Converted
Class B Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause
(A) hereinabove.

 



 

(d)

 



 

(i) Consistent with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)
(including proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(5)(v))
and Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2), on an issuance of
additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the
issuance of a Noncompensatory Option, the issuance of Partnership Interests as
consideration for the provision of services (including upon the lapse of a
"substantial risk of forfeiture" with respect to a Unit), the conversion of
the Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to _Section 11.3(b)_, the
issuance of Partnership Interests pursuant to the Merger, or the conversion of
Class B Units to Common Units pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_, the Carrying
Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property; _provided, however_ , that in the
event of the issuance of a Partnership Interest pursuant to the exercise of a
Noncompensatory Option where the right to share in Partnership

 



      

 

 



 

capital represented by such Partnership Interest differs from the
consideration paid to acquire and exercise such option, the Carrying Value of
each Partnership property immediately after the issuance of such Partnership
Interest shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property and the Capital
Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); _provided further_ , that in
the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of
cash or Contributed Property, in the event of an issuance of a Noncompensatory
Option to acquire a de minimis Partnership Interest or in the event of an
issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for
the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such
adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests (or, in
the case of a Revaluation Event resulting from the exercise of a
Noncompensatory Option, immediately after the issuance of the Partnership
Interest acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Noncompensatory Option)
shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as
it may adopt. In making its determination of the fair market values of
individual properties, the General Partner may first determine an aggregate
value for the assets of the Partnership that takes into account the current
trading price of the Common Units, the fair market value of all other
Partnership Interests at such time and the value of Partnership Liabilities.
The General Partner shall make all adjustments necessary to account for the
difference, if any, between the fair market value of any Series A Preferred
Units for which the Series A Conversion Date has not occurred and the
aggregate Capital Accounts attributable to such Series A Preferred Units to
the extent of any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss that has not been
reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts previously, consistent with the
methodology of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The
General Partner may allocate such aggregate value among the individual
properties of the Partnership in such manner as it determines appropriate.
Absent a contrary determination by the General Partner, the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash or
cash equivalents) immediately prior to a Revaluation Event shall be the value
that would result in the Capital Account for each Common Unit that is
Outstanding prior to such Revaluation Event being equal to the Event Issue
Value.

 



 

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Carrying Value of all
Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual
distribution that is not made pursuant to _Section 12.4_ or in the case of a
deemed distribution, be determined in the same manner as that provided in
_Section 5.5(d)(i)_ or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant
to _Section 12.4_, be determined by the Liquidator using such method of
valuation as it may adopt.

 



 

(iii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s),
immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into a Series A
Conversion Unit in accordance with _Section 5.11(b)(v)_ or _Section
5.11(b)(vi)_, the Capital Account

 



     

 

 



 

of each Partner and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall be
adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to
such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had
been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to
its fair market value immediately after such conversion and (A) first, all
Unrealized Gain (if the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion Unit
is less than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding Common Unit)
or Unrealized Loss (if the Capital Account of each such Series A Conversion
Unit is greater than the Per Unit Capital Account for a then Outstanding
Common Unit) had been allocated Pro Rata to each Partner holding Series A
Conversion Units received upon such conversion until the Capital Account of
each such Series A Conversion Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for
a then Outstanding Common Unit; and (B) second, any remaining Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to
_Section 6.1_. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the
aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets
immediately after the conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit shall be
determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may
adopt (taking into account Section 7701(g) of the Code); provided, however,
that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into
account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at
such time and must make such adjustments to such valuation as required by
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2). The General Partner shall
allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership in such
manner as it determines in its discretion. If, after making the allocations of
Unrealized Gain and Unrealized Loss as set forth above in this _Section
5.5(d)(iii)_, the Capital Account of each Partner with respect to each Series
A Conversion Unit received upon such conversion of the Series A Preferred Unit
is less than the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit,
then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners
holding Common Units (other than Series A Conversion Units) and Partners
holding Series A Conversion Units so as to cause the Capital Account of each
Partner holding a Series A Conversion Unit to equal, on a per Unit basis with
respect to each such Series A Conversion Unit, the Per Unit Capital Amount for
a then Outstanding Common Unit.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Issuances of Additional Partnership Interests_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.7_ and _Section 5.11(b)(iii)_, the Partnership may
issue additional Partnership Interests (other than General Partner Interests)
and Derivative Partnership Interests for any Partnership purpose at any time
and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms
and conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all without the
approval of any Limited Partners.

 



 

(b) Each additional Partnership Interest authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 5.6(a) _may be issued in one or more
classes, or one or more series of any such classes, with such designations,
preferences, rights, powers and duties (which may be senior to existing
classes and series of Partnership Interests), as shall be fixed by the General
Partner, including (i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or
items thereof; (ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the
rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and
the terms and conditions upon which, the Partnership may or shall be required
to redeem the Partnership Interest; (v) whether such Partnership Interest is
issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon
which each Partnership Interest will be issued,

 



     

 

 



 

evidenced by Certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for
determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Interest; and
(viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Interest to vote on
Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative rights,
preferences and privileges of such Partnership Interest.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership
Interests and Derivative Partnership Interests pursuant to this _Section
5.6_, (ii) the conversion of the Combined Interest into Units pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, (iii) the issuance of Class B Units pursuant to
_Section 5.10_ and the conversion of Class B Units into Common Units pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, (iv) reflecting admission of such additional
Limited Partners in the Register as the Record Holders of such Limited Partner
Interests and (v) all additional issuances of Partnership Interests. The
General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the
holders of the Units or other Partnership Interests being so issued. The
General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act
and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of Partnership
Interests or in connection with the conversion of the Combined Interest into
Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any
statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other
governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or
other Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to trading.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Limited Preemptive Right_ _. _Except as provided in this _Section
5.7_, _Section 5.11(b)(viii)_ or as otherwise provided in a separate
agreement by the Partnership, no Person shall have any preemptive,
preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any
Partnership Interest, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter
created. The General Partner shall have the right, which it may from time to
time assign in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase
Partnership Interests from the Partnership whenever, and on the same terms
that, the Partnership issues Partnership Interests to Persons other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the
Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its Affiliates equal to that
which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such Partnership Interests.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Splits and Combinations_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(E)_, the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Interests to all Record Holders or may effect a
subdivision or combination of Partnership Interests (other than the Series A
Preferred Units) so long as, after any such event, each Partner shall have the
same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any
amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units are
proportionately adjusted.

 



 

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Interests is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice (or such shorter periods as required by applicable law). The General
Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it
to calculate the number of Partnership

 



     

 

 



 

Interests to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such
distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be
entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive
evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.

 



 

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates or uncertificated Partnership Interests to
the Record Holders of Partnership Interests as of the applicable Record Date
representing the new number of Partnership Interests held by such Record
Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it
determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes. If any such
combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Interests
Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to
a Record Holder of Partnership Interests represented by Certificates, the
surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to
such Record Date.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests_ _. _All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in
accordance with the requirements of, this _Article V_ shall be fully paid and
non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such
non-assessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 or 17-804 of the
Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Establishment of Class B Units_.

 



 

(a) _Establishment_. The General Partner hereby designates and creates a
series of Limited Partner Interests to be designated as "Class B Units,"
initially consisting of a total of 7,000,000 Class B Units (of which 2,500,000
shall be designated Class B-1 Units, 2,500,000 shall be designated Class B-2
Units and 1,000,000 shall be designated Class B-3 Units), having the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

 



 

(b) _Rights Upon Liquidation and Dissolution_. The holders of the Class B
Units shall have rights upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership,
including the right to share in any liquidating distributions pursuant to
_Section 12.4_, in accordance with _Article XII_ of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Class B Units_.

 



 

(i) Immediately before the close of business on the Class B-1 Conversion Date,
the Class B-1 Units shall become convertible at the option of the holder into
Common Units on a one-for-one basis. Immediately before the close of business
on the Class B-2 Conversion Date, the Class B-2 Units shall become convertible
at the option of the holder into Common Units on a one-for-one basis.
Immediately before the close of business on the Class B-3 Conversion Date, the
Class B-3 Units shall become convertible at the option of the holder into
Common Units on a one-for-one basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Class
B Units that have not yet become convertible pursuant to this _Section
5.10(c)(i)_ shall become convertible at the option of the holder into Common
Units on a one-for-one basis immediately before a Change of Control.

 



 

(ii) Upon conversion, the rights of a holder of Converted Class B Units as
holder of Class B Units shall cease with respect to such Converted Class B
Units, including any

 



     

 

 



 

rights under this Agreement with respect to holders of Class B Units, and such
Person shall continue to be a Limited Partner and have the rights of a holder
of Common Units under this Agreement. All Class B Units shall, upon conversion
pursuant to this _Section 5.10(c)_, be deemed to be transferred to, and
cancelled by, the Partnership in exchange for the Common Units into which the
Class B Units converted.

 



 

(iii) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common Units
upon conversion of the Class B Units. However, the holder shall pay any tax or
duty which may be payable relating to any transfer involving the issuance or
delivery of Common Units in a name other than the holders name. The Transfer
Agent may refuse to deliver a Certificate representing Common Units being
issued in a name other than the holders name until the Transfer Agent
receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax or duties which will be due because
the Common Units are to be issued in a name other than the holders name.
Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or
regulation.

 



 

(A) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.7_, the Partnership shall keep
free from preemptive rights a sufficient number of Common Units to permit the
conversion of all outstanding Class B Units into Common Units to the extent
provided in, and in accordance with, this _Section 5.10(c)_.

 



 

(B) All Common Units delivered upon conversion of the Class B Units shall be
newly issued, shall be duly authorized and validly issued, and shall be free
from preemptive rights (except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.7_) and
free of any lien or adverse claim.

 



 

(C) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Common Units upon conversion of Class
B Units and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange, or any other National Securities Exchange or other market,
shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed and quoted the Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Class B Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

 



 

(D) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give
to any holder of Class B Units any rights as a creditor in respect of its
right to conversion.

 



 

(d) _Voting_. The Class B Units will have such voting rights pursuant to this
Agreement as such Class B Units would have if they were Common Units that were
then Outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units as a single
class, except that Class B Units owned by the General Partner and its
Affiliates shall not be entitled to vote, approve or consent on matters if
Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates are excluded from
voting, approving or consenting on such matters, and except that the Class B
Units shall be entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter on which
Unitholders are entitled to vote that adversely affects the rights or
preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of Partnership
Interests in any material respect or as required by law. The approval of a
majority (or such other percentage as set forth in this Agreement) of the
Class B Units shall be required to

 



     

 

 



 

approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are entitled to
vote as a separate class.

 



 

(e) _Other Rights of Class B Units_. Except with respect to the right to
participate in allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction and
distributions made with respect to Common Units, the holder of a Class B Unit
shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Unitholder holding Common
Units hereunder; provided, however, that immediately upon the conversion of a
Class B Unit into a Common Unit following the earlier to occur of the
applicable Class B Conversion Date and a Change of Control, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_, the Unitholder holding such Common Unit issued
upon conversion of such Class B Unit shall possess all of the rights and
obligations of a Unitholder holding a Common Unit hereunder with respect to
such Common Unit issued upon conversion of such Class B Unit, including the
right to participate in distributions made with respect to Common Units;
provided, further, that such Class B Unit shall be and after conversion into a
Common Unit following the earlier to occur of the applicable Class B
Conversion Date and a Change of Control, as applicable, pursuant to _Section
5.10(c)_ shall remain subject to the provisions of _Sections 5.5(c)(ii)_ ,
_6.1(d)(x)(A)_ and _6.4(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
following the earlier to occur of the applicable Class B Conversion Date or a
Change of Control, the holder of a Class B Unit that is entitled to convert
but has not converted pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_ shall have the right to
participate in distributions made with respect to Common Units Pro Rata as if
each Class B Unit held by such holder were converted into Common Units
pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_ on the Record Date for the applicable
distribution.

 



 

(f) _Certain Provisions_. Each Class B Unit and each Class B Unit that has
converted into a Common Unit shall be subject to the provisions of _Sections
5.5(c)(ii)_ , _5.5(d)_ , _6.1(d)(x)(A)_ and _6.4(a)_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Establishment of Series A Preferred Units_.

 



 

(a) _General_. There is hereby created a class of Units designated as "Series
A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Units" (such Series A Perpetual Convertible
Preferred Units, the " ** _Series A Preferred Units_**"), with the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights, privileges, powers, duties and obligations as set forth in
this _Section 5.11_ and elsewhere in this Agreement. A total of 22,554,851
Series A Preferred Units shall be issued by the Partnership on the Series A
Issuance Date pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Series A Purchase
Agreement. Each Series A Preferred Unit shall constitute a "security" within
the meaning of, and governed by, (i) Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code
(including Section 8-102(a)(15) thereof) as in effect from time to time in the
State of Delaware, and (ii) the corresponding provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code of any other applicable jurisdiction that now or hereafter
substantially includes the 1994 revisions to Article 8 thereof as adopted by
the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws and approved by the American Bar Association on February
14, 1995. If requested by a Series A Preferred Unitholder, the Partnership
shall cause the Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Unitholder to
be evidenced by physical Certificates registered in the name of the holder
thereof. The Transfer Agent for the Series A Preferred Units shall be American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Rights of Series A Preferred Units_. The Series A Preferred Units shall
have the following rights, preferences and privileges and the Series A
Preferred Unitholders shall be subject to the following duties and
obligations:

 



 

(i) _Distributions_.

 



 

(A) Commencing with the Quarter ending on [June 30], 2019, subject to _Section
5.11(b)(i)(D)_, each Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units as of an
applicable Record Date for each Quarter shall be entitled to receive, in
respect of each Series A Preferred Unit held by such Record Holder, cumulative
distributions in respect of such Quarter (or portion thereof for which a
Series A Quarterly Distribution is due), in cash, equal to the sum of (1) the
Series A Distribution Amount for such Quarter and (2) any Series A Unpaid
Distributions with respect to such Series A Preferred Unit (collectively, the
" ** _Series A Quarterly Distribution_**"). Each Series A Quarterly
Distribution shall be payable quarterly by no later than the earlier of 45
days after the end of the applicable Quarter and the payment date of
distributions, if any, on any Series A Parity Securities and Series A Junior
Securities (each such payment date, a " ** _Series A Distribution Payment
Date_**"). If the General Partner establishes an earlier Record Date for any
distribution to be made by the Partnership on other Partnership Interests in
respect of any Quarter, then the Record Date established pursuant to this
_Section 5.11(b)(i)_ for a Series A Quarterly Distribution in respect of such
Quarter shall be the same Record Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Series
A Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions made pursuant to
_Section 6.3(a)_.

 



 

(B) If the Partnership fails to pay in full the Series A Distribution Amount
of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in accordance with _Section
5.11(b)(i)(A)_ when due for any Quarter, then from and after the first date of
such failure and continuing until such failure is cured by payment in full in
cash of all such arrearages, (1) the amount of such unpaid cash distributions
(on a per Series A Preferred Unit basis, " ** _Series A Unpaid
Distributions_**") unless and until paid will accrue and accumulate from and
including the first day of the Quarter immediately following the Quarter in
respect of which the first such payment is due until all such Series A Unpaid
Distributions are paid in full in cash and (2) the Partnership shall not be
permitted to, and shall not, declare, make or set aside, any distributions,
redemptions or repurchases in respect of any Series A Junior Securities or
Series A Parity Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to the Quarter for which the Partnership first failed to pay in full
the Series A Distribution Amount of any Series A Quarterly Distribution in
cash when due), other than, in each case, a regular distribution with respect
to a series of Series A Junior Securities that is paid in kind with additional
Series A Junior Securities of such series; _provided, however,_ that
distributions may be declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Units and the
Series A Parity Securities so long as such distributions are declared and paid
pro rata so that amounts of distributions declared per Series A Preferred Unit
and Series A Parity Security shall in all cases bear to each other the same
ratio that accrued and accumulated distributions per Series A Preferred Unit
and Series A Parity Security bear to each other.

 



 

(C) The aggregate Series A Distribution Amount shall be paid out of cash and
cash equivalents that is deemed to be Available Cash for the applicable

 



     

 

 



 

Quarter. To the extent that any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution
to be paid in cash with respect to any Quarter exceeds the amount of cash and
cash equivalents that is deemed to be Available Cash for such Quarter, the
amount of cash equal to the cash and cash equivalents that is deemed to be
Available Cash for such Quarter will be paid to the Series A Preferred
Unitholders, Pro Rata, and the balance of such Series A Quarterly Distribution
shall be unpaid and shall constitute an arrearage and shall accrue and
accumulate as set forth in _Section 5.11(b)(i)(B)_.

 



 

(D) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.11(b)(i)_ to the contrary,
with respect to any Series A Preferred Unit that is converted into a Common
Unit, (1) with respect to a distribution to be made to Record Holders as of
the Record Date immediately preceding the date of such conversion, the Record
Holder of such Series A Preferred Unit as of such Record Date shall be
entitled to receive such distribution in respect of such Series A Preferred
Unit on the corresponding Series A Distribution Payment Date, but shall not be
entitled to receive such distribution in respect of the Common Units into
which such Series A Preferred Unit was converted on the payment date thereof,
and (2) with respect to a distribution to be made to Record Holders as of any
Record Date as of or following the date of such conversion, the Record Holder
of the Series A Conversion Units into which such Series A Preferred Unit was
converted as of or prior to such Record Date shall be entitled to receive such
distribution in respect of such Series A Conversion Units on the payment date
thereof, but shall not be entitled to receive such distribution in respect of
such Series A Preferred Unit on the corresponding Series A Distribution
Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Series A Preferred Unit is
converted into Series A Conversion Units pursuant to the terms hereof
following a Record Date but prior to the corresponding Series A Distribution
Payment Date, then the Record Holder of such Series A Preferred Unit as of
such Record Date shall nonetheless remain entitled to receive on the Series A
Distribution Payment Date a distribution in respect of such Series A Preferred
Unit pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)(i)(A)_ and, until such distribution is
received, _Section 5.11(b)(i)(B)_ shall continue to apply.

 



 

(E) Subject to _Section 5.11(b)(ii)(D)_, each Series A Preferred Unit will
have the right to share in any special distributions by the Partnership of
cash, securities or other property Pro Rata with the Common Units or any other
Series A Junior Securities, on an as-converted basis, provided that special
distributions shall not include regular quarterly distributions paid in the
normal course of business on the Common Units pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_.
No adjustments pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(E)_ shall be made with respect
to a special distribution in which the Series A Preferred Units participate
Pro Rata with the Common Units, on an as-converted basis, pursuant to this
_Section 5.11(b)(i)(E)_ and subject to _Section 5.11(b)(ii)(D)_.

 



 

(ii) _Voting Rights_.

 



 

(A) Except as provided in this _Section 5.11(b)(ii)_, the Outstanding Series
A Preferred Units shall have voting rights that are identical to the voting
rights of the Common Units into which such Series A Preferred Units would be
converted at the then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate (regardless of
whether the Series A Preferred Units are then convertible), and shall vote
with the Common Units as a single

 



     

 

 



 

class (including for purposes of _Section 7.9(a)_ and _Section 11.1(b)_), so
that the Record Holder of each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit will be
entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred
Unit would be converted at the then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate
(regardless of whether the Series A Preferred Units are then convertible) on
each matter with respect to which each Record Holder of a Common Unit is
entitled to vote; provided, however, that Series A Preferred Units that are
held by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates shall not be considered
Outstanding or be entitled to vote on any matter on which the Series A
Preferred Units are entitled to vote (whether voting as a separate class or on
an as converted basis with the Common Units). Each reference in this Agreement
to a vote of Record Holders of Common Units shall be deemed to be a reference
to the Record Holders of Common Units and Series A Preferred Units, voting
together as a single class during any period in which any Series A Preferred
Units are Outstanding.

 



 

(B) Except as provided in _Section 5.11(b)(ii)(C)_ and _Section
5.11(b)(ii)(D)_, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
addition to all other requirements imposed by Delaware law, and all other
voting rights granted under this Agreement, the affirmative vote of the Record
Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage shall be required for any
amendment to this Agreement or the Certificate of Limited Partnership
(including by merger or otherwise or any amendment contemplated by and made in
accordance with _Section 5.11(b)(iii)_) that is adverse (other than in a _de
minimis_ manner) to any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the
Series A Preferred Units. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, any amendment shall be deemed to have such an adverse impact that is
not _de minimis_ if such amendment would:

 



 

(1) reduce the Series A Distribution Amount, change the form of payment of
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, defer the date from which
distributions on the Series A Preferred Units will accrue, cancel any accrued
and unpaid distributions on the Series A Preferred Units or any interest
accrued thereon (including any Series A Unpaid Distributions or Series A
Partial Period Distributions), or change the seniority rights of the Series A
Preferred Unitholders as to the payment of distributions in relation to the
holders of any other class or series of Partnership Interests;

 



 

(2) reduce the amount payable or change the form of payment to the Record
Holders of the Series A Preferred Units upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of all or substantially all of
the assets, of the Partnership, or change the seniority of the liquidation
preferences of the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units in relation
to the rights of the holders of any other class or series of Partnership
Interests upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Partnership;
or

 



 

(3) make the Series A Preferred Units redeemable or convertible at the option
of the Partnership other than as set forth herein.

 



 

(C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.11(b)(ii)_,
to the extent Unitholder approval (including, for the avoidance of

 



     

 

 



 

doubt, approval by a Unit Majority) is required in connection with a
Partnership Rollup Event or Partnership Restructuring Event that is undertaken
in compliance with _Section 5.11(b)(vi)_ and provides for, as applicable, the
Series A Preferred Units to be fully converted (including into MOIC Common
Units, if applicable), redeemed for cash or converted into Series A
Substantially Equivalent Units:

 



 

(1) each Series A Preferred Unitholder covenants to the Partnership, and
solely to the Partnership, that it shall vote, or cause to be voted, all
Series A Preferred Units owned (beneficially or of record) by such Series A
Preferred Unitholder in favor of such Partnership Rollup Event or Partnership
Restructuring Event; and

 



 

(2) for purpose of the Unitholder approval required to approve such
Partnership Rollup Event or Partnership Restructuring Event (and solely for
purposes of such Unitholder approval and for no other purposes) any Series A
Conversion Units and Common Units owned (beneficially or of record) by the
Series A Preferred Unitholders will not be considered to be Outstanding.

 



 

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Series A Preferred
Unitholders voting as a separate class shall not be required in connection
with any Series A Change of Control (including a Partnership Rollup Event) or
Partnership Restructuring Event that is undertaken in compliance with _Section
5.11(b)(vi)_ and provides for, as applicable, the Series A Preferred Units to
be fully converted (including into MOIC Common Units, if applicable), redeemed
for cash or converted into Series A Substantially Equivalent Units.

 



 

(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the affirmative
vote of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage shall be
required to approve any special or non-recurring distributions.

 



 

(iii) _Issuances of Series A Senior Securities and Series A Parity
Securities_. For so long as any Series A Preferred Unit is Outstanding, the
Partnership shall not, without the affirmative vote of the Record Holders of
the Series A Required Voting Percentage, issue any (A) Series A Senior
Securities (or amend the provisions of any class of Partnership Interests to
make such class of Partnership Interests a class of Series A Senior
Securities), (B) Series A Parity Securities (or amend the provisions of any
class of Partnership Interests to make such class of Partnership Interests a
class of Series A Parity Securities) or (C) Series A Preferred Units;
_provided, however,_ that, without the consent of any holder of Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units (but without prejudice to their rights to vote on an
as-converted basis to the extent that the Common Units are entitled to vote on
any such matter), the Partnership may issue a number of additional Series A
Parity Securities (which may be in the form of additional Series A Preferred
Units) with an aggregate purchase price, calculated together with the purchase
price of all issued Series A Preferred Units and all Series A Parity
Securities (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Series A Preferred Units
issued on the Series A Issuance Date) up to $1,300,000,000 at any time.

 



      

 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, subject to _Section
5.11(b)(v)(E)_, the Partnership may, without any vote of the holders of
Outstanding Series A Preferred Units (but without prejudice to their rights to
vote on an as-converted basis to the extent that the Common Units are entitled
to vote on any such matter), create (by reclassification or otherwise) and
issue Series A Junior Securities in an unlimited amount.

 



 

(iv) _Legends_. Unless otherwise directed by the General Partner, each book
entry or Certificate evidencing a Series A Preferred Unit shall bear a
restrictive notation in substantially the following form:

 



 

 _THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF EQM MIDSTREAM
PARTNERS, LP THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE
EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP TO BE TREATED AS AN
ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN ENTITY FOR
FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED)._

 



 

 _THE GENERAL PARTNER OF EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP MAY IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS
ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT DETERMINES, WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL,
THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE TO (I) AVOID A SIGNIFICANT
RISK OF EQM MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR
OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
OR (II) PRESERVE THE UNIFORMITY OF THE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS OF EQM
MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP (OR ANY CLASS OR CLASSES OR SERIES THEREOF)._

 



 

 _THIS SECURITY IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS TRANSFER PROVIDED
IN THE FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF EQM
MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP, AS AMENDED, SUPPLEMENTED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO
TIME. COPIES OF SUCH AGREEMENT MAY BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN REQUEST
MADE BY THE HOLDER OF RECORD OF THIS SECURITY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE GENERAL
PARTNER AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF THE PARTNERSHIP. THE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF
ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED
TO TRADING._

 



     

 

 



 

(v) _Conversion_.

 



 

(A) _At the Option of the Series A Preferred Unitholders_. Beginning with the
earlier of (1) [*], 2021(3) and (2) immediately prior to the liquidation of
the Partnership under _Section 12.4_, the Series A Preferred Units owned by
any Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be convertible, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time upon the request of such Series A Preferred
Unitholder, but, in the case of the preceding clause (1), not more than once
per Quarter by such Series A Preferred Unitholder (inclusive of any conversion
(other than a conversion made pursuant to the preceding clause (2)) by such
Series A Preferred Unitholders Affiliates, with each Series A Preferred
Unitholder and its Affiliates being entitled to a single conversion right per
Quarter), into a number of Common Units determined by multiplying the number
of Series A Preferred Units to be converted by in the case of clause (1) or
(2) above, the Series A Conversion Rate at such time; _provided, however_ ,
that the Partnership shall not be obligated to honor any such conversion
request unless such conversion will involve an aggregate number of Series A
Preferred Units with an underlying value of Common Units equal to or greater
than $30 million (taking into account and including any concurrent conversion
requests by any Affiliates of such Series A Preferred Unitholder) based on the
Closing Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Series A Conversion
Notice Date (or a lesser underlying value if such conversion (1) will result
in the conversion of all of the Series A Preferred Units held by such holder
or (2) has been approved by the General Partner). Immediately upon the
issuance of Series A Conversion Units as a result of any conversion of Series
A Preferred Units hereunder, subject to _Section 5.11(b)(i)(D)_, all rights
of the Series A Converting Unitholder with respect to such Series A Preferred
Units shall cease, including any further accrual of distributions, and such
Series A Converting Unitholder thereafter shall be treated for all purposes as
the owner of Common Units. Fractional Common Units shall not be issued to any
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.11(b)(v)(A)_ (each fractional Common Unit
shall be rounded to the nearest whole Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit shall
be rounded to the next higher Common Unit)). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.11(b)(v)(A)_, if any lender, other creditor or
counterparty under any Permitted Loan transaction (including any agent or
trustee on their behalf) or any Affiliate of the foregoing exercises any
rights or remedies under such Permitted Loan on foreclosure or other exercise
of remedies or rights in respect of any pledged Series A Preferred Units, then
such pledged Series A Preferred Units may be immediately converted by such
lender, creditor or counterparty into Series A Conversion Units.

 



 

(B) _At the Option of the Partnership_. At any time after [*], 2021,(4) the
Partnership shall have the option, at any time and from time to time, but not
more than once per Quarter, to convert all or any portion of the Series A
Preferred Units then Outstanding into a number of Common Units determined by
multiplying the number of Series A Preferred Units to be converted by the
Series A Conversion Rate at such time. Fractional Common Units shall not be
issued to any Person pursuant to this _Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)_ (each
fractional Common Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole

  **(3)** **NTD:** To be the second anniversary of the date hereof.

 

 **(4)** **NTD:** To be the second anniversary of the date hereof.

 



     

 

 



 

Common Unit (and a 0.5 Common Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Common
Unit)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for the Partnership to
exercise such option:

 



 

(1) the Common Units must be listed or admitted for trading on a National
Securities Exchange;

 



 

(2) the Closing Price must exceed $68.28 for the 20 consecutive Trading Days
immediately preceding the Series A Mandatory Conversion Notice Date;

 



 

(3) the average daily trading volume of the Common Units on the principal
National Securities Exchange on which the Common Units are then listed or
admitted to trading must exceed 500,000 Common Units (as such amount may be
adjusted to reflect any Unit split, combination or similar event) for the 20
consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Series A Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date;

 



 

(4) the Partnership must have an effective registration statement on file with
the Commission covering resales of the underlying Common Units to be received
by the applicable Series A Preferred Unitholders upon any such conversion; and

 



 

(5) there are no Series A Unpaid Distributions at such time.

 



 

Any such conversion shall be allocated among the Series A Preferred
Unitholders on a Pro Rata basis or on such other basis as may be agreed upon
by all Series A Preferred Unitholders.

 



 

Nothing in this _Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)_, however, is intended to limit or
prevent a Series A Preferred Unitholder from electing to convert its Series A
Preferred Units into Common Units in accordance with _Section 5.11(b)(v)(A)_,
and the Partnership shall not have any right to convert Series A Preferred
Units from a Series A Preferred Unitholder to the extent such Series A
Preferred Unitholder delivers a valid Series A Conversion Notice covering all
of the Series A Preferred Units that are the subject of the applicable Series
A Mandatory Conversion Notice to the Partnership prior to the Series A
Conversion Date in respect of the applicable Series A Mandatory Conversion
Notice.

 



 

(C) _Conversion Notice_.

 



 

(1) To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to _Section
5.11(b)(v)(A)_, a Series A Converting Unitholder shall give written notice (a
" ** _Series A Conversion Notice_**," and the date such notice is received, a
" ** _Series A Conversion Notice Date_**") to the Partnership stating that
such Series A Preferred Unitholder elects to so convert Series A Preferred
Units pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(A)_, the number of Series A Preferred
Units to be converted and the Person to whom the applicable Series A
Conversion Units should be issued.

 



     

 

 



 

(2) To convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units pursuant to _Section
5.11(b)(v)(B)_, the Partnership shall give written notice (a " ** _Series A
Mandatory Conversion Notice_**," and the date such notice is sent by the
Partnership, a " ** _Series A Mandatory Conversion Notice Date_**") to each
Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units stating that the Partnership elects
to so convert Series A Preferred Units pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)_
and the number of Series A Preferred Units to be so converted. The applicable
Series A Conversion Units shall be issued in the name of the Record Holder of
such Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(D) _Timing_. If a Series A Conversion Notice is delivered by a Series A
Preferred Unitholder to the Partnership or a Series A Mandatory Conversion
Notice is delivered by the Partnership to a Series A Preferred Unitholder,
each in accordance with _Section 5.11(b)(v)(C)_, the Partnership shall issue
the applicable Series A Conversion Units no later than two Business Days after
the Series A Conversion Notice Date or 5 Business Days after the Series A
Mandatory Conversion Notice Date, as the case may be, occurs (any date of
issuance of Common Units upon conversion of Series A Preferred Units pursuant
to this _Section 5.11(b)(v)_ or _Section 5.11(b)(vi)_, a " ** _Series A
Conversion Date_**"); _provided_ , that the Series A Conversion Date shall in
no event be prior to the fifth Business Day following the Series A Mandatory
Conversion Notice Date. On the Series A Conversion Date, the Partnership shall
instruct, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause, its
Transfer Agent to electronically transmit the Series A Conversion Units
issuable upon conversion to such Series A Preferred Unitholder (or designated
recipient(s)), by crediting the account of the Series A Preferred Unitholder
(or designated recipient(s)) through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission
system. The Partnership and each Series A Preferred Unitholder agree to
coordinate with the Transfer Agent to accomplish this objective. Subject to
_Section 5.11(b)(i)(D)_, upon issuance of Series A Conversion Units to the
Series A Converting Unitholder (or its designated recipient(s)), all rights of
such Series A Converting Unitholder with respect to the converted Series A
Preferred Units shall cease, and such Series A Converting Unitholder (or its
designated recipients(s)) shall be treated for all purposes as the Record
Holder of such Series A Conversion Units.

 



 

(E) _Distributions, Combinations, Subdivisions and Reclassifications by the
Partnership_. If, after the Series A Issuance Date, the Partnership (1) makes
a distribution on the Common Units payable in Common Units or other
Partnership Interests, (2) subdivides or splits its outstanding Common Units
into a greater number of Common Units, (3) combines or reclassifies the Common
Units into a lesser number of Common Units, (4) issues by reclassification of
its Common Units any Partnership Interests (including any reclassification in
connection with a merger, consolidation or business combination in which the
Partnership is the surviving Person), (5) effects a Pro Rata repurchase of
Common Units, in each case other than in connection with a Series A Change of
Control (which shall be governed by _Section 5.11(b)(vi)_), (6) issues to
holders of Common Units, in their capacity as holders of Common Units, rights,
options or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Units
at less than the market value thereof, (7) distributes to holders of Common
Units evidences of indebtedness, Partnership Interests (other than Common
Units) or other assets (including

 



     

 

 



 

securities, but excluding any distribution referred to in clause (1) above,
any rights or warrants referred to in clause (6) above, any consideration
payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries and any distribution of Units or any class or
series, or similar Partnership Interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or
other business unit of the Partnership in the case of certain spin-off
transactions described below), or (8) consummates a spin-off, where the
Partnership makes a distribution to all holders of Common Units consisting of
Units of any class or series, or similar equity interests of, or relating to,
a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Partnership, then the Series A
Conversion Rate and the dollar amount set forth in _Section
5.11(b)(v)(B)(2)_, in each case, in effect at the time of the Record Date for
such distribution or the effective date of any such other transaction shall be
proportionately adjusted: (aa) in respect of clauses (1) through (4) above, so
that the conversion of the Series A Preferred Units after such time shall
entitle each Series A Preferred Unitholder to receive the aggregate number of
Common Units (or any Partnership Interests into which such Common Units would
have been combined, consolidated, merged or reclassified, as applicable) that
such Series A Preferred Unitholder would have been entitled to receive if the
Series A Preferred Units had been converted into Common Units immediately
prior to such Record Date or effective date, as the case may be, (bb) in
respect of clauses (5) through (8) above, in the reasonable discretion of the
General Partner to appropriately ensure that the Series A Preferred Units are
convertible into an economically equivalent number of Common Units after
taking into account the event described in clauses (5) through (8) above, and
(cc) in addition to the foregoing, in the case of a merger, consolidation or
business combination in which the Partnership is the surviving Person and any
Series A Preferred Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall provide
effective provisions to ensure that the provisions in this _Section 5.11_
relating to the Series A Preferred Units shall not be abridged or amended and
that the Series A Preferred Units shall thereafter retain the same powers,
economic rights, preferences and relative participating, optional and other
special rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon,
that the Series A Preferred Units had immediately prior to such transaction or
event and the Series A Conversion Rate and the dollar amount set forth in
_Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)(2)_, and any other terms of the Series A Preferred
Units that the General Partner in its reasonable discretion determines require
adjustment to achieve the economic equivalence described below, shall be
proportionately adjusted to take into account any such subdivision, split,
combination or reclassification. An adjustment made pursuant to this _Section
5.11(b)(v)(E)_ shall become effective immediately after the Record Date, in
the case of a distribution, and shall become effective immediately after the
applicable effective date, in the case of a subdivision, combination,
reclassification (including any reclassification in connection with a merger,
consolidation or business combination in which the Partnership is the
surviving Person), split or spin-off. Such adjustment shall be made
successively whenever any event described above shall occur.

 



 

(F) _No Adjustments for Certain Items_. Notwithstanding any of the other
provisions of this _Section 5.11(b)(v)_, no adjustment shall be made to the
Series A Conversion Rate or the Series A Issue Price pursuant to _Section
5.11(b)(v)(E)_ as a result of any of the following:

 



     

 

 



 

(1) any cash distributions made to holders of the Common Units (unless made in
breach of _Section 5.11(b)(i)(B)_);

 



 

(2) any issuance of Partnership Interests or securities convertible into
Partnership Interests in exchange for cash;

 



 

(3) any grant of Common Units or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
receive Common Units or the issuance of Common Units upon the exercise or
vesting of any such options, warrants or rights in respect of services
provided to or for the benefit of the Partnership or its Affiliates, under
compensation plans and agreements approved by the General Partner (including
any long-term incentive plan);

 



 

(4) any issuance of Common Units as all or part of the consideration to effect
(aa) the closing of any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity
interests of a third party in an arms-length transaction, (bb) the closing of
any acquisition by the Partnership of assets or equity interests of ETRN or
any of its Affiliates or (cc) the consummation of a merger, consolidation or
other business combination of the Partnership with another entity in which the
Partnership survives and the Common Units remain Outstanding to the extent any
such transaction set forth in clause (aa), (bb) or (cc) above is approved by
the General Partner;

 



 

(5) the issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Units or any Series A Parity Securities; or

 



 

(6) the issuance of Common Units upon conversion of the Class B Units.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) whenever the
issuance of a Partnership Interest or other event would require an adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Rate under one or more provisions of this
Agreement, only one adjustment shall be made to the Series A Conversion Rate
in respect of such issuance or event and (y) unless otherwise determined by
the General Partner, no adjustment to the Series A Conversion Rate or the
Series A Issue Price shall be made with respect to any distribution or other
transaction described in _Section 5.11(b)(v)(E)_ if the Series A Preferred
Unitholders are entitled to participate in such distribution or transaction as
if they held a number of Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Units immediately prior to such event at the then applicable Series
A Conversion Rate, without having to convert their Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(vi) _Series A Change of Control_.

 



 

(A) At least 10 Business Days prior to consummating a Series A Cash Change of
Control, the Partnership shall provide written notice thereof to the Series A
Preferred Unitholders. Subject to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)_, in the event of a
Series A Cash Change of Control, the Outstanding Series A Preferred Units
shall be automatically converted, without requirement of any action of the
Series A Preferred Unitholders, into

 



     

 

 



 

Common Units at the Series A Conversion Rate immediately prior to the closing
of the applicable Series A Cash Change of Control.

 

(B) At least 10 Business Days prior to consummating a Series A Change of
Control (other than a Series A Cash Change of Control), the Partnership shall
provide written notice thereof to the Series A Preferred Unitholders. Subject
to _Section 5.11(b)(v)(B)_, if a Series A Change of Control (other than a
Series A Cash Change of Control) occurs, then each Series A Preferred
Unitholder, with respect to all but not less than all of its Series A
Preferred Units, by notice given to the Partnership within 10 Business Days of
the date the Partnership provides written notice of the execution of
definitive agreements that provide for such Series A Change of Control, shall
be entitled to elect one of the following (with the understanding that any
Series A Preferred Unitholder who fails to timely provide notice of its
election to the Partnership shall be deemed to have elected the option set
forth in clause (1) below):

 



 

(1) convert all, but not less than all, of such Series A Preferred
Unitholders Outstanding Series A Preferred Units into Common Units at the
then-applicable Series A Conversion Rate;

 



 

(2) if the Partnership will not be the surviving Person upon the consummation
of such Series A Change of Control or the Partnership will be the surviving
Person but its Common Units will no longer be listed or admitted to trading on
a National Securities Exchange, require the Partnership to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or to cause to be delivered to such
Series A Preferred Unitholder, in exchange for its Series A Preferred Units
upon the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, a security in the
surviving Person or the parent of the surviving Person that has rights,
preferences and privileges substantially equivalent to the Series A Preferred
Units, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (a) the right to distributions
equal in amount and timing to those provided in _Section 5.11(b)(i)_, (b) a
conversion rate proportionately adjusted such that the conversion of such
security in the surviving Person or parent of the surviving Person immediately
following the consummation of such Series A Change of Control would entitle
the Record Holder to the number of common securities of such Person (together
with a number of common securities of equivalent value to any other assets
received by a holder of Common Units in such Series A Change of Control)
which, if a Series A Preferred Unit had been converted into Common Units
immediately prior to such Series A Change of Control, such Record Holder would
have been entitled to receive immediately following such Series A Change of
Control and (c) in the event the issuer of such security is a corporation
modifications to the definition of "Series A Change of Control" to the extent
reasonably necessary to conform such definition to the analogous definition
set forth in such issuers senior debt facilities (but in no event less
favorable to the Series A Preferred Unitholders than the definition of "Series
A Change of Control" as defined in this Agreement) (such security in the
surviving Person, a " ** _Series A Substantially Equivalent Unit_**");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Partnership is unable to deliver or
cause to be delivered Series A Substantially Equivalent Units to such Series A
Preferred Unitholder in connection with such Series A Change of

 



     

 

 



 

Control, each Series A Preferred Unitholder (at such holders election) shall
be entitled to exercise the options provided in _Section 5.11(b)(vi)(B)(1)_
or _Section 5.11(b)(vi)(B)(4)_, or require the Partnership to convert the
Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A Preferred Unitholder
immediately prior to such Series A Change of Control into a number of Common
Units (the " ** _MOIC Common Units_** ") at a conversion ratio per Series A
Preferred Unit owned by such Series A Preferred Unitholder equal to: the
quotient of (I) (a) the product of (i) 160% multiplied by (ii) the Series A
Issue Price less (b) the sum of the aggregate cash distributions paid on such
Series A Preferred Unit on or prior to the date of such Series A Change of
Control, divided by (II) an amount equal to 95% of the VWAP of the Common
Units for the 20-day period immediately preceding the consummation of such
Series A Change of Control; _provided_ , _further_ , that such ratio shall in
no event result in a Series A Preferred Unit that is being converted into MOIC
Common Units having a MOIC Value that exceeds (x) 120% of the Series A Issue
Price, in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring prior to the
first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date; (y) 125% of the Series A
Issue Price, in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring on or after
the first anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but prior to the second
anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date; and (z) 135% of the Series A Issue
Price, in the case of a Series A Change of Control occurring on or after the
second anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date but prior to the third
anniversary of the Series A Issuance Date;

 



 

(3) if the Partnership is the surviving Person upon the consummation of such
Series A Change of Control, continue to hold such Series A Preferred
Unitholders respective Series A Preferred Units; or

 



 

(4) require the Partnership to redeem all (but not less than all) of such
Series A Preferred Unitholders respective Series A Preferred Units at a price
per Series A Preferred Unit equal to 101% of the sum of (aa) the Series A
Accrued Amount of such Series A Preferred Unit plus (bb) any Series A Partial
Period Distributions on such Series A Preferred Unit. Any redemption pursuant
to this clause (4) shall, as determined by the General Partner, be paid in
cash, in Common Units or in a combination thereof. If all or any portion of
such redemption is to be paid in Common Units, the Common Units to be issued
shall be valued at 95% of the VWAP for the 20-day period ending on the fifth
Trading Day immediately preceding the consummation of such Series A Change of
Control; _provided_ , that any Series A Preferred Unitholder that requires the
Partnership to redeem its Series A Preferred Units pursuant to this _Section
5.11(b)(vi)(B)(4)_ shall have the right to withdraw such election with respect
to all (but not less than all) of its Series A Preferred Units at any time
prior to the fifth Trading Day immediately preceding the consummation of such
Series A Change of Control and instead elect to be treated in accordance with
any of clauses (1) through (3) above. No later than three Trading Days prior
to the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, the Partnership shall
deliver a written notice to the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units
stating the date on which the Series A Preferred Units will be redeemed and
the Partnerships computation of the amount of cash and/or Common Units to be
received by the Record Holder upon redemption of such Series A

 



     

 

 



 

Preferred Units. If the Partnership shall be the surviving Person upon the
consummation of such Series A Change of Control, then no later than 5 Business
Days following the consummation of such Series A Change of Control, the
Partnership shall remit the applicable cash and/or Common Unit consideration
to each Record Holder of then Outstanding Series A Preferred Units entitled to
receive such cash or Common Unit consideration pursuant to this clause (4). If
the Partnership will not be the surviving Person upon the consummation of such
Series A Change of Control, then the Partnership shall remit the applicable
cash and/or Common Unit consideration to such Record Holders immediately prior
to the consummation of such Series A Change of Control. The Record Holders
shall deliver to the Partnership Certificates representing the Series A
Preferred Units, if any, as soon as practicable following such redemption.
Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall retain all of the rights
and privileges thereof unless and until the consideration due to such Record
Holders as a result of such redemption is paid in full in cash, Common Units
or a combination of the foregoing, as applicable. After any such redemption,
any such redeemed Series A Preferred Unit shall no longer constitute an issued
and Outstanding Limited Partner Interest.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Partnership Rollup Event, each
Series A Preferred Unitholder may elect to exercise any of the options
provided under _Section 5.11(b)(vi)(B)(1)_, _Section 5.11(b)(vi)(B)(2)_ or
_Section 5.11(b)(vi)(B)(4)_.

 



 

(vii) _Restrictions on Transfers of Series A Preferred Units_.

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)_ (other
than the restriction on transfers to a Person that is not a U.S. resident
individual or an entity that is not treated as a U.S. corporation or
partnership set forth in _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)_), subject to _Section
4.7_, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to transfer any
Series A Preferred Units owned by such Series A Preferred Unitholder to any of
its respective Affiliates or to any Series A Preferred Unitholder.

 



 

(B) Without the prior written consent of the General Partner, except as
specifically provided in the Series A Purchase Agreement or this Agreement,
each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall not: (1) prior to [*], 2020,(5)
offer, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase,
purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to
purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly,
any of its Series A Preferred Units; (2) prior to [*], 2021,(6) directly or
indirectly engage in any short sales of Partnership Interests or other
derivative or hedging transactions with Partnership Interests, that are
designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to, result in the transfer
to another Person, in whole or in part, of any of the economic consequences of
ownership of any Series A Preferred Units; (3) transfer any Series A Preferred
Units to any non-U.S. resident individual, non-U.S. corporation or
partnership, or any other non-U.S. entity, including any foreign governmental
entity,

  **(5)** **NTD:** To be the first anniversary of the date hereof.

 

 **(6)** **NTD:** To be the second anniversary of the date hereof.

 



     

 

 



 

including by means of any swap or other transaction or arrangement that
transfers or that is designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to,
result in the transfer to another, in whole or in part, of any of the economic
consequences of ownership of any Series A Preferred Units, regardless of
whether any transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of Series
A Preferred Units, Common Units or Class B Units, in cash or otherwise (
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing clause (3) shall not apply if, prior
to any such transfer or arrangement, such individual, corporation, partnership
or other entity establishes, to the satisfaction of the Partnership, that it
is entitled to a complete exemption from tax withholding, including under Code
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1471 through 1474, and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder); (4) effect any transfer of Series A Preferred Units or Series A
Conversion Units in a manner that violates the terms of this Agreement; or (5)
effect any transfer of Series A Preferred Units to a Competitor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include any pledgee of, or holder of a security interest in,
Series A Preferred Units) receiving any Series A Preferred Units pursuant to
this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)_ (including upon any foreclosure upon pledged
Series A Preferred Units) shall be obligated to agree to the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)_ as a condition to such transfer. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no way shall this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)_ be
deemed to restrict or prohibit changes in the composition of any Series A
Preferred Unitholder or its partners or members so long as such changes in
composition only relate to changes in direct or indirect ownership of the
Capital Stock of such Series A Preferred Unitholder among such Series A
Preferred Unitholder, its Affiliates and the members or limited partners of
any private equity fund vehicles that indirectly own such Series A Preferred
Unitholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.11(b)(vii)(B)_, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to
pledge all or any portion of its Series A Preferred Units (including any
Series A Conversion Units into which the Series A Preferred Units may convert)
in connection with a Permitted Loan, and neither (A) the foreclosure of any
such pledged Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units, as the
case may be, nor (B) the transfer of Series A Preferred Units or Series A
Conversion Units, as the case may be, by a pledgee or counterparty who has
foreclosed or exercised remedies or rights on any such pledged or transferred
Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units shall be considered a
violation or breach of this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(B)_.

 



 

(C) Subject to _Section 4.7_ and compliance with any applicable securities
laws or other provisions of this Agreement, at any time after [*], 2020,(7)
the Series A Preferred Unitholders may freely transfer their Series A
Preferred Units, provided that prior to [*], 2021(8) each such transfer
involves an aggregate number of Series A Preferred Units with an underlying
value of Common Units equal to or greater than $50 million (taking into
account and including any concurrent transfers by any Affiliates of such
Series A Preferred Unitholder) based on the Closing Price on the Trading Day
immediately preceding the date of transfer (or a lesser underlying value if
such transfer (1) will result in the transfer of all of the Series A Preferred
Units held by such holder or (2) has been approved by the General Partner in
its sole discretion); _provided, however_ ,

  **(7)** **NTD:** To be the first anniversary of the date hereof.

 

 **(8)** **NTD:** To be the second anniversary of the date hereof.

 



     

 

 



 

that this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(C)_ shall not eliminate, modify or reduce the
obligations set forth in clauses (3), (4) or (5) of _Section
5.11(b)(vii)(B)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.11(b)(vii)(C)_, each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be permitted to
pledge all or any portion of its Series A Preferred Units (including any
Series A Conversion Units into which the Series A Preferred Units may convert)
in connection with a Permitted Loan, and neither (A) the foreclosure of any
such pledged Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units, as the
case may be, nor (B) the transfer of Series A Preferred Units or Series A
Conversion Units, as the case may be, by a pledgee or counterparty who has
foreclosed or exercised remedies or rights on any such pledged or transferred
Series A Preferred Units or Series A Conversion Units shall be considered a
violation or breach of this _Section 5.11(b)(vii)(C)_.

 



 

(viii) _Preemptive Rights_. Prior to any issuance of Series A Parity
Securities permitted under Section 5.11(b)(iii), the Partnership shall, by
written notice to the Series A Preemptive Rights Holders (the " ** _Notice of
Issuance_** "), if any, offer to sell such Series A Parity Securities to the
Series A Preemptive Rights Holders on terms and subject to conditions
determined by the General Partner to be reasonable, which offer shall be made
on a Pro Rata basis such that each Series A Preemptive Rights Holder shall be
entitled to purchase a portion of such Series A Parity Securities equal to the
quotient of (A) the number of Series A Preferred Units held by such Series A
Preemptive Rights Holder on the date of the Notice of Issuance divided by (B)
the aggregate number of Series A Preferred Units held by all Series A
Preemptive Rights Holders on the date of the Notice of Issuance; provided,
that the offer of such Series A Parity Securities shall not be on a basis less
favorable to the Series A Preemptive Rights Holders than is offered to any
purchaser thereof who is not a Series A Preemptive Rights Holder; _provided_ ,
further that if any Series A Preemptive Rights Holder fails to provide written
notice of its intent to exercise its right to purchase Series A Parity
Securities within ten (10) Business Days of the Notice of Issuance, such
Series A Preemptive Rights Holder shall be deemed to have waived any and all
rights to purchase such Series A Parity Securities in such transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Partnership be obligated
to offer to sell Series A Parity Securities to the Series A Preemptive Rights
Holders pursuant to this _Section 5.11(b)(viii)_ in connection with any
securities issued to the owners of another entity in connection with the
acquisition of such entity by the Partnership by merger, consolidation, sale
or exchange of securities, purchase of substantially all of the assets, or
other reorganization whereby the Partnership acquires more than 50% of the
voting power or assets of such entity.

 



 

(ix) _Allocations_.

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following any
allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)_ but prior to making any
allocation pursuant to another portion of _Section 6.1_, all or any portion
of any items of Partnership gross income or gain for the taxable period shall
be allocated to all Unitholders in respect of Series A Preferred Units, Pro
Rata, until the aggregate of such items allocated to such Unitholders pursuant
to this _Section 5.11(b)(ix)(A)_ for the current and all previous taxable
periods since issuance of the Series A Preferred Units is equal to the sum of,
with respect to each Series A Preferred Unit, (1) the Series A Distribution
Amount in respect of such Series A Preferred Unit, (2) the difference between
the initial Capital Account balance and the Series A Issue Price with respect
to such Series A Preferred Unit, and (3) the aggregate

 



     

 

 



 

Net Loss allocated to the Unitholders with respect to such Series A Preferred
Unit pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)(ix)(B)_ for the current and all previous
taxable periods. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
6.1(a)_, in no event shall any Net Income be allocated pursuant to _Section
6.1(a)_ to Unitholders in respect of Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(b)_, (1)
Unitholders holding Series A Preferred Units shall not receive any allocation
pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ with respect to their Series A Preferred
Units and (2) following any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_
and prior to any allocation made pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_, Net Loss
shall be allocated to all Unitholders holding Series A Preferred Units, Pro
Rata, until the Adjusted Capital Account of each such Unitholder in respect of
each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit has been reduced to zero.

 



 

(x) _Liquidation Value_. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution and
winding up of the Partnership under _Section 12.4_, either voluntary or
involuntary, the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall be
entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Partnership available for
distribution to the Partners or any assignees, prior and in preference to any
distribution of any assets of the Partnership to the Record Holders of any
Series A Junior Securities, the positive value in each such Holders Capital
Account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units. At least 10 days prior to
any liquidation or winding up of the Partnership under _Section 12.4_, the
Partnership shall provide to the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred
Units an estimate of the Capital Account in respect of each Series A Preferred
Unit after giving effect to the allocations described in this _Section
5.11(b)(x)_. If in the year of such liquidation and winding up, any such
Record Holders Capital Account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units is
less than the aggregate Series A Accrued Amount of such Series A Preferred
Units, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, and prior to any other allocation pursuant to this Agreement for
such year and prior to any distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence,
items of gross income and gain shall be allocated to all Unitholders then
holding Series A Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the Capital Account in
respect of each Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit is equal to the Series A
Accrued Amount (and no other allocation pursuant to this Agreement shall
reverse the effect of such allocation). If in the year of such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up any such Record Holders Capital Account in respect
of such Series A Preferred Units is less than the aggregate Series A Accrued
Amount of such Series A Preferred Units after the application of the preceding
sentence, then to the extent permitted by applicable law and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, items of gross income
and gain for any preceding taxable period(s) with respect to which IRS Form
1065 Schedules K-1 have not been filed by the Partnership shall be reallocated
to all Unitholders then holding Series A Preferred Units, Pro Rata, until the
Capital Account in respect of each such Outstanding Series A Preferred Unit
after making allocations pursuant to this and the immediately preceding
sentence is equal to the Series A Accrued Amount (and no other allocation
pursuant to this Agreement shall reverse the effect of such allocation). At
the time of the dissolution of the Partnership, subject to Section 17-804 of
the Delaware Act, the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units shall
become entitled to receive any Series A Unpaid Distributions in respect of the
Series A Preferred Units as of the date of such dissolution, and shall have
the status of, and shall be entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor
of the Partnership with respect to such Series A Unpaid Distributions, and
such entitlement of the Record Holders of the Series A Preferred Units to such
Series A Unpaid Distributions shall have priority over any

 



     

 

 



 

entitlement of any other Partners or assignees with respect to any
distributions by the Partnership to such other Partners or assignees;
provided, however, that the General Partner, as such, will have no liability
for any obligations with respect to such Series A Unpaid Distributions to any
Record Holder(s) of Series A Preferred Units.

 



 

(xi) _Fully Paid and Non-Assessable. _Any Series A Conversion Unit(s)
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.11_ shall be validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable (except as such non-assessability may be affected by
Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act), and shall be free and
clear of any liens, claims, rights or encumbrances other than those arising
under the Delaware Act or this Agreement or created by the holders thereof.

 



 

(xii) _Notices_. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall distribute
or make available to the Record Holders of Series A Preferred Units copies of
all notices, materials, annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements,
information statements and any other documents distributed generally to the
Record Holders of Common Units of the Partnership, at such times and by such
method as such documents are distributed to such Record Holders of such Common
Units. In addition, each Quarter within ten Business Days following the Record
Date for such Quarter, the Partnership will distribute or make available to
each Record Holder that, together with its Affiliates, holds more than 5% of
the Series A Preferred Units, a statement certified by an officer of the
General Partner, stating, as of the applicable Record Date, (i) the number of
Series A Preferred Units held of record by such Record Holder of Series A
Preferred Units, (ii) the Series A Distribution Amount with respect to the
Series A Preferred Units held of record by such Record Holder of Series A
Preferred Units and (iii) the total accrued, accumulated and unpaid Series A
Unpaid Distributions with respect to the Series A Preferred Units held of
record by such Record Holder of Series A Preferred Units. The Partnership
shall promptly notify all Series A Purchasers (and any of their Affiliates
that are or become Unitholders) of any action taken upon the affirmative vote
of the Record Holders of the Series A Required Voting Percentage.

 



 

(xiii) _Tax Information_. As soon as reasonably practical following receipt of
a written request from any Series A Preferred Unitholder, the Partnership
shall provide such Series A Preferred Unitholder with (a) any information such
Series A Preferred Unitholder and its representatives may reasonably request
in order to determine its current and anticipated Capital Account in relation
to each Common Unit to evaluate the economic and tax implications of either a
liquidation or conversion of the Series A Preferred Units and (b) a good faith
estimate (and reasonable supporting calculations) of whether there is
sufficient Unrealized Gain attributable to the Partnership property on the
date of such request such that, if any of such Series A Preferred Unitholders
Series A Preferred Units were converted to Series A Conversion Units and such
Unrealized Gain was allocated to such Series A Preferred Unitholder pursuant
to Section 5.5(d), such Series A Preferred Unitholders Capital Account in
respect of its Common Units would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for
a Common Unit without any need for reallocations pursuant to the final
sentence of Section 5.5(d)(iii). Each Series A Preferred Unitholder shall be
entitled to make such a request not more than once per calendar year.

 



      

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI 
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Allocations for Capital Account Purposes_. Except as provided in
_Section 5.11_, for purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in
determining the rights of the Partners among themselves, the Partnerships
items of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in accordance with
_Section 5.5(b)_) for each taxable period shall be allocated among the
Partners as provided herein below.

 



 

(a) _Net Income_. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Income for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 



 

(i) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate of the Net Income
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ for the
current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the aggregate of the Net
Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ for
all previous taxable periods; and

 



 

(ii) The balance, if any, to all Unitholders (other than the Series A
Preferred Unitholders), Pro Rata.

 



 

(b) _Net Loss. _After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
_Section 6.1(d)_, Net Loss for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Loss for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

 



 

(i) First, to the Unitholders (other than the Series A Preferred Unitholders),
Pro Rata; provided, that Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(b)(i)_ to the extent that such allocation would cause any
Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the
end of such taxable period (or increase any existing deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account); and

 



 

(ii) The balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

 



 

(c) [ _Reserved_ ]

 



 

(d) _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 6.1_, the following special allocations shall be made for such
taxable period:

 



 

(i) _Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this _Section 6.1_, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this _Section 6.1(d)_, each Partners Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain
required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other
allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ with respect to such taxable
period (other than an allocation pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(vi)_ and
_Section 6.1(d)(vii)_).

 



     

 

 



 

This _Section 6.1(d)(i)_ is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum
Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(ii) _Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain_. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_ (other than _Section 6.1(d)(i)_),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a
net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(0)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this _Section 6.1(d)_, each Partners Adjusted Capital Account balance
shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required hereunder
shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant
to this _Section 6.1(d)_ and other than an allocation pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(i)_, _Section 6.1(d)(vi)_ and _Section 6.1(d)(vii)_ with respect to
such taxable period. This _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_ is intended to comply with the
chargeback of items of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

 



 

(iii) _Priority Allocations_. If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of
any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to
_Section 12.4_ or with respect to Series A Preferred Units) with respect to a
Unit exceeds the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property
distributed with respect to another Unit other than a Class B Unit (the amount
of the excess, an " ** _Excess Distribution_** " and the Unit with respect to
which the greater distribution is paid, an " ** _Excess Distribution Unit_**
"), then there shall be allocated gross income and gain to each Unitholder
receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to the Excess Distribution Unit
until the aggregate amount of such items allocated with respect to such Excess
Distribution Unit pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_ for the current
taxable period and all previous taxable periods is equal to the amount of the
Excess Distribution.

 



 

(iv) _Qualified Income Offset_. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be
specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted
Capital Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this _Section
6.1(d)(iv)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account as adjusted after all
other allocations provided for in this _Section 6.1_ have been tentatively
made as if this _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ were not in this Agreement.

 



 

(v) _Gross Income Allocation_. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance
in its Capital Account at the end of any taxable period in excess of the sum
of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed
obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
gross

 



     

 

 



 

income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; provided,
that an allocation pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(v)_ shall be made only if
and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its
Capital Account as adjusted after all other allocations provided for in this
_Section 6.1_ have been tentatively made as if _Section 6.1(d)(iv)_ and this
_Section 6.1(d)(v)_ were not in this Agreement.

 



 

(vi) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines
that the Partnerships Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a
different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

 



 

(vii) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, the Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

 



 

(viii) _Nonrecourse Liabilities_. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among
the Partners Pro Rata.

 



 

(ix) _Code Section 754 Adjustments_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain
or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

 



 

(x) _Economic Uniformity; Changes in Law_.

 



 

(A) At the election of the General Partner, all or a portion of the remaining
items of Partnership gross income, gain, deduction or loss for any taxable
period, after taking into account allocations pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(iii)_, shall be allocated 100% to the holder or holders of Class B
Units or the Common Units resulting from the conversion of Class B Units
pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_ (" ** _Converted Class B Units_**") in the
proportion of the number of the Class B Units or the Converted Class B Units
held by such holder or holders to the total number of Class B Units or
Converted Class B Units then Outstanding, until each such holder has been
allocated an amount of income, gain, loss or deduction that causes the Capital
Account maintained with respect to such Class B Units or Converted Class B
Units to be an amount equal to the product of (1) the number

 



     

 

 



 

of Class B Units or Converted Class B Units held by such holder and (2) the
Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit (other than a Common Unit issued
upon the conversion of a Class B Unit). The purpose of this allocation is to
establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Class B Units or
the Converted Class B Units and the Capital Accounts underlying most or all of
the Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates.

 



 

(B) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems
appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost
recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the provisions
of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation
of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or
(y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner
Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt
such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this
Agreement as provided in this _Section 6.1(d)(x)(B)_ only if such
conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse
effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations
are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

 



 

(xi) _Curative Allocation_.

 



 

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.1_, other than the
Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken into account in
making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible, the net amount
of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner
pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been allocated
to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations
and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in this
_Section 6.1_. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations
relating to (1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except
to the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and
(2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to
the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain. In exercising its discretion under this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_, the
General Partner may take into account future Required Allocations that,
although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required Allocations
previously made. Allocations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ shall
only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General
Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with
the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ shall be deferred with respect to allocations
pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the General Partner
determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent
Required Allocations.

 



 

(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of _Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ in whatever order is most likely

 



     

 

 



 

to minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to _Section
6.1(d)(xi)(A)_ among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Allocations for Tax Purposes_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners
in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or
deduction is allocated pursuant to _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined to be appropriate by the
General Partner (taking into account the General Partners discretion under
_Section 6.1(d)(x)_); provided, that the General Partner shall apply the
principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in all events.

 



 

(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of
an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-1(a)(6) or any successor regulations
thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot
reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and
amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner
Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization
deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a
direct interest in the Partnerships property. If the General Partner chooses
not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other
depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the
intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as
such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited
Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests.

 



 

(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.12501(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions
and to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest)
have been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

 



 

(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the
Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall

 



     

 

 



 

be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into
account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the
Code.

 



 

(f) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction, for federal
income tax purposes, shall be determined for each taxable period and prorated
on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of
the National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed
or admitted to trading on the first Business Day of each month; provided,
however, that gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of any assets of the
Partnership or any other extraordinary item of income or loss realized and
recognized other than in the ordinary course of business, as determined by the
General Partner, shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the
National Securities Exchange on which the Partnership Interests are listed or
admitted to trading on the first Business Day of the month in which such gain
or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner may
revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation to the extent
permitted or required by Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or
rulings promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(g) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this _Article VI_ shall instead be made to the beneficial owner
of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee, agent or representative in any
case in which such nominee, agent or representative has furnished the identity
of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the
Code or any other method determined by the General Partner.

 



 

(h) If, as a result of (i) an exercise of a Noncompensatory Option or (ii) the
conversion of a Series A Preferred Unit into Common Units and the adjustments
pursuant to _Section 5.5(d)(iii)_, a Capital Account reallocation is required
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner
shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

 



 

Section 6.3 _Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 5.11(b)(i)_, within 45 days following the end of each
Quarter, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such
Quarter shall be distributed in accordance with this _Article VI_ by the
Partnership to the Partners Pro Rata as of the Record Date selected by the
General Partner, except (i) the holders of Class B-1 Units shall not be
entitled to distributions of Available Cash prior to the earlier to occur of
the Class B-1 Conversion Date or a Change of Control, (ii) the holders of
Class B-2 Units shall not be entitled to distributions of Available Cash prior
to the earlier to occur of the Class B-2 Conversion Date or a Change of
Control and (iii) the holders of Class B-3 Units shall not be entitled to
distributions of Available Cash prior to the earlier to occur of the Class B-3
Conversion Date or a Change of Control. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the
Class B-1 Units will be entitled to distributions of Available Cash with
respect to the Quarter ending March 31, 2021, (B) the Class B-2 Units will be
entitled to distributions of Available Cash with respect to the Quarter ending
March 31, 2022 and (C) the Class B-3 Units will be entitled to distributions
of Available Cash with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2023. All
distributions required to be made under this Agreement shall be made subject
to Sections 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_, in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all cash received during or after the Quarter
in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed solely
in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of _Section
12.4_.

 



 

(c) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as
a distribution of Available Cash to such Partners, as determined appropriate
under the circumstances by the General Partner.

 



 

(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnerships liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Special Provisions Relating to the Class B Units_.

 



 

(a) The holder or holders of Converted Class B Units resulting from the
conversion pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_ of any Class B Units issued pursuant
to _Section 5.10_ shall not be issued a Common Unit Certificate pursuant to
_Section 4.1_, and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Units until
such time as the General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that
each such Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic
economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material respects, to
the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of a Common
Unit. In connection with the condition imposed by this _Section 6.4(a)_, the
General Partner may take whatever steps are required to provide economic
uniformity to such Common Units, including the application of _Section
6.1(d)(x)(A)_; provided, however, that no such steps may be taken that would
have a material adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units (for
this purpose the allocations of items of income, gain, loss or deduction with
respect to Class B Units or with respect to Common Units will be deemed not to
have a material adverse effect on the Common Units).

 



 

(b) A Unitholder shall not be permitted to transfer a Class B Unit or a Common
Unit issued upon conversion of a Class B Unit pursuant to _Section 5.10(c)_
(other than a transfer to an Affiliate) if the remaining balance in the
transferring Unitholders Capital Account after giving effect to the
allocation under _Section 5.5(c)_ would be negative.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Special Provisions Relating to Series A Preferred Units_.

 



 

(a) Subject to any applicable transfer restrictions in _Section 4.7_ or
_Section 5.11(b)(vii)_, the holder of a Series A Preferred Unit or a Series A
Conversion Unit shall (which may be satisfied by a lender under a Permitted
Loan on its behalf) provide notice to the Partnership of the transfer of any
such Series A Preferred Unit or Series A Conversion Unit, as applicable, by
the earlier of (i) 30 days following such transfer and (ii) the last Business
Day of the calendar year during which such transfer occurred, unless, with
respect to a transfer of a Series A Conversion Unit, by virtue of the
application of _Section 5.5(d)(iii)_, the Partnership has previously
determined, based on the advice of counsel, that the transferred Series A
Conversion

 



     

 

 



 

Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal
income tax characteristics of a Common Unit. In connection with the condition
imposed by this _Section 6.5_, the Partnership shall take whatever steps are
required to provide economic uniformity to the Series A Conversion Unit in
preparation for a transfer of such Unit; _provided, however_ , that no such
steps may be taken that would have a material adverse effect on the
Unitholders holding Common Units (for this purpose the allocations of income,
gain, loss and deductions, and any reallocation of Capital Account balances,
among the Partners in accordance with _Section 5.5(d)(iii)_ and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4) with respect to Series A Preferred
Units or Series A Conversion Units will be deemed not to have a material
adverse effect on the Unitholders holding Common Units).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
holders of the Series A Preferred Units (i) shall (A) possess the rights and
obligations provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner
pursuant to _Article III_ and _Article VII_ and (B) have a Capital Account
as a Partner pursuant to _Section 5.5_ and all other provisions related
thereto and (ii) shall not (A) be entitled to vote on any matters requiring
the approval or vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, except as provided
in _Section 5.11_ or (B) be entitled to any distributions other than as
provided in _Section 5.11_ and _Article VI_.

(a) The General Partner shall conduct, direct and manage all activities of the

even if the same results in the terms of the transaction being less favorable
to the Partnership than would otherwise be the case);

 



 

(vi) the distribution of cash held by the Partnership;

 



 

(vii) the selection and dismissal of employees (including employees having

(xi) the indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies
to the extent permitted by law;

 



 

(xii) the entering into of listing agreements with any National Securities

to any prior approval that may be required under _Section 4.7_);

 



      

 

 



 

(xiii) the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of Partnership

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each of
the Partners and each other Person who has acquired or may acquire an interest
in Partnership Interests hereby (i) has approved, ratified and confirmed or
approves, ratifies and confirms the execution, delivery and performance by the
parties thereto of this Agreement and the Group Member Agreement of each other
Group Member, the Underwriting Agreement, the EQT Omnibus Agreement, the
Contribution Agreement, and the other agreements described in or filed as
exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement that are related to the
transactions contemplated by the IPO Registration Statement (collectively, the
" ** _Transaction Documents_** ") (in each case other than this Agreement,
without giving effect to any amendments, supplements or restatements thereof
entered into after the date such Person becomes bound by the provisions of
this Agreement); (ii) agreed or agrees that the General Partner (on its own or
on behalf of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and perform
the agreements referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the other
agreements, acts, transactions and matters described in or contemplated by the
IPO Registration Statement on behalf of the Partnership without any further
act, approval or vote of the Partners or the other Persons who may acquire an
interest in Partnership Interests or otherwise bound by this Agreement; and
(iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance by the General
Partner, any Group Member or any Affiliate of any of them of this Agreement or
any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement (including the
exercise by the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner of the
rights accorded pursuant to _Article XV_) shall not constitute a breach by
the General Partner of any duty or any other obligation of any type whatsoever
that the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited Partners or
any other Persons under this Agreement (or any other agreements) or of any
duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Certificate of Limited Partnership_. The General Partner has
caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act. The General
Partner has caused a Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Limited
Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
on October 12, 2018 to reflect the change of the Partnerships name from "EQT
Midstream Partners, LP" to "EQM Midstream Partners, LP." The General Partner
has caused an additional Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Limited
Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
on February 22, 2019 to reflect the change of the General Partner from EQM
Midstream Services, LLC to EQGP Services, LLC. The General Partner shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or
documents that the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate
for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited
partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited

 



     

 

 



 

liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in which the
Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent the
General Partner determines such action to be necessary or appropriate, the
General Partner shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate
of Limited Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a
limited partnership (or a partnership or other entity in which the limited
partners have limited liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of
any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. Subject to the terms of _Section 3.3(a)_, the General Partner shall
not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the
Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification document or any
amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

 



 

Section 7.3 Restrictions on the General Partners Authority to Sell Assets of
the Partnership Group _. _Except as provided in _Article XII_ and _Article
XIV_, the General Partner may not sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership Group, taken as a whole,
in a single transaction or a series of related transactions without the
approval of holders of a Unit Majority; provided, however, that this provision
shall not preclude or limit the General Partners ability to mortgage, pledge,
hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of the
assets of the Partnership Group and shall not apply to any forced sale of any
or all of the assets of the Partnership Group pursuant to the foreclosure of,
or other realization upon, any such encumbrance.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Reimbursement of the General Partner_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in this _Section 7.4_ and elsewhere in this Agreement,
the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general
partner or managing member of any Group Member.

 



 

(b) Subject to the ETRN Omnibus Agreement and the Secondment Agreement, the
General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other basis as
the General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and indirect expenses it
incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership Group (including
salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any Person,
including Affiliates of the General Partner, to perform services for the
Partnership Group or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to
the Partnership Group), and (ii) all other expenses allocable to the
Partnership Group or otherwise incurred by the General Partner or its
Affiliates in connection with managing and operating the Partnership Groups
business and affairs (including expenses allocated to the General Partner by
its Affiliates). The General Partner shall determine the expenses that are
allocable to the Partnership Group. Reimbursements pursuant to this _Section
7.4_ shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a
result of indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.7_. This provision does not
affect the ability of the General Partner and its Affiliates to enter into an
agreement to provide services to any Group Member for a fee or otherwise than
for cost.

 



 

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and
employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Interests or options to purchase or rights, warrants
or appreciation rights or phantom or tracking interests relating to
Partnership Interests), or cause the Partnership to issue Partnership
Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests in

 



     

 

 



 

connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan, employee program
or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or any of
its Affiliates in each case for the benefit of employees and directors of the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in respect of services performed,
directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership Group. The
Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates any Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests that
the General Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to any
employees, consultants and directors pursuant to any such employee benefit
plans, employee programs or employee practices. Expenses incurred by the
General Partner in connection with any such plans, programs and practices
(including the net cost to the General Partner or such Affiliates of
Partnership Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests purchased by the
General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to fulfill options or
awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in
accordance with _Section 7.4(b)_. Any and all obligations of the General
Partner under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee
practices adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this _Section
7.4(c)_ shall constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and
shall be assumed by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to
_Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ or the transferee of or successor to all of
the General Partners General Partner Interest pursuant to _Section 4.6_.

 



 

(d) The General Partner and its Affiliates may charge any member of the
Partnership Group a management fee to the extent necessary to allow the
Partnership Group to reduce the amount of any state franchise or income tax or
any tax based upon the revenues or gross margin of any member of the
Partnership Group if the tax benefit produced by the payment of such
management fee or fees exceeds the amount of such fee or fees.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Outside Activities_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner, for so long as it is the General Partner of the
Partnership, (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as a general
partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the Partnership and any
other partnership or limited liability company of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to undertake activities that
are ancillary or related thereto (including being a Limited Partner in the
Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business or activity or incur
any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its
performance as general partner or managing member, if any, of one or more
Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the IPO Registration
Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt securities or equity
interests in any Group Member, or (C) subject to the limitations contained in
the ETRN Omnibus Agreement, the performance of its obligations under the ETRN
Omnibus Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms of _Section 7.5(c)_, each Unrestricted Person (other
than the General Partner) shall have the right to engage in businesses of
every type and description and other activities for profit and to engage in
and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every type or
description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged in
by any Group Member, independently or with others, including business
interests and activities in direct competition with the business and
activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach
of this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to any Group Member or any Partner; provided such Unrestricted
Person does not engage in such business or activity using confidential or
proprietary information provided by or

 



     

 

 



 

on behalf of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person. None of any Group
Member, any Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by
virtue of this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership
relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any Unrestricted
Person.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms of _Sections 7.5(a)_ and _(b)_ , but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the engaging
in competitive activities by any Unrestricted Person (other than the General
Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.5_ is hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to
be a breach of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, of
the General Partner or any other Unrestricted Person for the Unrestricted
Persons (other than the General Partner) to engage in such business interests
and activities in preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership and
(iii) the Unrestricted Persons shall have no obligation hereunder or as a
result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, to
present business opportunities to the Partnership. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Unrestricted Person (including the
General Partner). No Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) who
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other
matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership, shall have any duty to
communicate or offer such opportunity to the Partnership, and such
Unrestricted Person (including the General Partner) shall not be liable to the
Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other Person bound by this
Agreement for breach of any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Unrestricted Person (including the
General Partner) pursues or acquires for itself, directs such opportunity to
another Person or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the
Partnership, provided such Unrestricted Person does not engage in such
business or activity using confidential or proprietary information provided by
or on behalf of the Partnership to such Unrestricted Person.

 



 

(d) The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Interests in addition to those acquired on the IPO Closing Date
and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to
exercise, at their option, all rights relating to all Units and/or other
Partnership Interests acquired by them. The term "Affiliates" when used in
this _Section 7.5(d)_ with respect to the General Partner shall not include
any Group Member.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership or Group Members_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member,
and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, funds needed or desired by the Group Member for such periods of
time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine; provided,
however, that in any such case the lending party may not charge the borrowing
party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged the
borrowing party or impose terms less favorable to the borrowing party than
would be charged or imposed on the borrowing party by unrelated lenders on
comparable loans made on an arms-length basis (without reference to the
lending partys financial abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the
General Partner. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any
costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party
in connection with the borrowing of

 



     

 

 



 

such funds. For purposes of this _Section 7.6(a)_ and _Section 7.6(b)_, the
term "Group Member" shall include any Affiliate of a Group Member that is
controlled by the Group Member.

 



 

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner. No Group Member may lend funds to the
General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other than another Group Member).

 



 

Section 7.7 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all threatened, pending or completed claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals, in which
any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee and acting (or omitting or
refraining to act) in such capacity on behalf of or for the benefit of the
Partnership; provided, that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held
harmless pursuant to this Agreement if there has been a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining
that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith
or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter,
acted with knowledge that the Indemnitees conduct was unlawful; provided,
further, no indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be available
to any Indemnitee (other than a Group Member) with respect to any such
Indemnitees obligations pursuant to the Transaction Documents. Any
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ shall be made only out of the
assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall not
be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation to
contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to
effectuate such indemnification.

 



 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to _Section
7.7(a)_ in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining
that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.7_, the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified upon receipt by the Partnership of any undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be
ultimately determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized by this _Section 7.7_.

 



 

(c) The indemnification provided by this _Section 7.7_ shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under this
Agreement, any other agreement, pursuant to any vote of the holders of
Outstanding Limited Partner Interests, as a matter of law, in equity or
otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitees capacity as an Indemnitee
and as to actions in any other capacity (including any capacity under the
Underwriting Agreement), and

 



     

 

 



 

shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and
administrators of the Indemnitee.

 



 

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that
may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnerships
activities or such Persons activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of _Section 7.7(a)_; and action taken
or omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance
of its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to
be for a purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

 



 

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this _Section 7.7_ because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees and their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other
Persons.

 



 

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.7_ or any
provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of
any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership,
nor the obligations of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under
and in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such
claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Liability of Indemnitees_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the
Partnership Interests, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a
result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final
and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted
in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful

 



     

 

 



 

misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the
Indemnitees conduct was criminal.

 



 

(b) The General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this
Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

 



 

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnerships business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this _Section 7.8_ or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this _Section 7.8_ as
in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member
Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other, any resolution or
course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in respect of such
conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by all Partners,
and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any Group Member
Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty
stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action in
respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii)
approved by the vote of a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding
Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) and Outstanding
Series A Preferred Units (with such Series A Preferred Units to be treated on
an as-converted basis as described in _Section 5.11(b)(v)_), voting together
as a single class, (iii) determined by the Board of Directors of the General
Partner to be on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those
generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv)
determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner to be fair and
reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General
Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its resolution
of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval or Unitholder approval
of such resolution, and the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or
course of action that has not received Special Approval or Unitholder
approval. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group
Member Agreement, whenever the General Partner makes a determination to refer
any potential conflict of interest to the Conflicts Committee for Special
Approval, seek Unitholder approval or adopt a

 



     

 

 



 

resolution or course of action that has not received Special Approval or
Unitholder approval, then the General Partner shall be entitled, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or
decline to take such other action free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to
the Partnership or any Limited Partner, and the General Partner shall not, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or
pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member
Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act
or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity, and the General Partner in
making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action
shall be permitted to do so in its sole and absolute discretion. If Special
Approval is sought, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision,
the Conflicts Committee acted in good faith, and if the Board of Directors of
the General Partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken
with respect to a conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set
forth in clauses (iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be presumed that, in
making its decision, the Board of Directors of the General Partner acted in
good faith. In any proceeding brought by any Limited Partner or by or on
behalf of such Limited Partner or any other Limited Partner or the Partnership
challenging any action by the Conflicts Committee with respect to any matter
referred to the Conflicts Committee for Special Approval by the General
Partner, any action by the Board of Directors of the General Partner in
determining whether the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a
conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses
(iii) or (iv) above or whether a director satisfies the eligibility
requirements to be a member of the Conflicts Committee, the Person bringing or
prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming the
presumption that the Conflicts Committee or the Board of Directors of the
General Partner, as applicable, acted in good faith; in all cases subject to
the provisions for conclusive determination in _Section 7.9(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any duty
otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the conflicts of
interest described in the IPO Registration Statement are hereby approved by
all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Whenever the General Partner or the Board of Directors, or any committee
thereof (including the Conflicts Committee), makes a determination or takes or
declines to take any other action, or any Affiliate of the General Partner
causes the General Partner to do so, in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership as opposed to in its individual capacity, whether under this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or any other agreement, then, unless
another express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General
Partner, the Board of Directors or such committee or such Affiliates causing
the General Partner to do so, shall make such determination or take or decline
to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to any other
or different standards (including fiduciary standards) imposed by this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated hereby
or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. A
determination or other action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in
"good faith" for all purposes of this Agreement, if the Person or Persons
making such determination or taking or declining to take such other action
subjectively believe that the determination or other action or inaction is in
the best interests of the Partnership Group; provided, that if the Board of
Directors of the General Partner is making a determination or taking or
declining to take an action pursuant to clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the
first sentence of _Section 7.9(a)_, then in lieu thereof, such determination
or other action or inaction will conclusively be deemed to be in "good faith"
for all purposes of this Agreement if the members of the Board of Directors of
the General Partner making such determination or taking or declining to take
such other action subjectively believe that the determination or other action
or inaction meets

 



     

 

 



 

the standard set forth in clause (iii) or clause (iv) of the first sentence of
_Section 7.9(a)_, as applicable; provided further, that if the Board of
Directors of the General Partner is making a determination that a director
satisfies the eligibility requirements to be a member of a Conflicts
Committee, then in lieu thereof, such determination will conclusively be
deemed to be in "good faith" for all purposes of this Agreement if the members
of the Board of Directors of the General Partner making such determination
subjectively believe that the director satisfies the eligibility requirements
to be a member of the Conflicts Committee.

 



 

(c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to
take such other action free of any duty or obligation whatsoever to the
Partnership or any Limited Partner, and the General Partner, or such
Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard
imposed by this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement
contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation or at equity, and the Person or Persons making such determination
or taking or declining to take such other action shall be permitted to do so
in their sole and absolute discretion. By way of illustration and not of
limitation, whenever the phrase, "the General Partner at its option," or some
variation of that phrase, is used in this Agreement, it indicates that the
General Partner is acting in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of
doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its Partnership
Interests, or refrains from voting or transferring its Partnership Interests,
it shall be acting in its individual capacity.

 



 

(d) The General Partners organizational documents may provide that
determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather
than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if
the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the
General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the
General Partners general partner, if the General Partner is a partnership.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General
Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or
implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership
Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group
Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to
time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its
option.

 



 

(f) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or required by the
Delaware Act, neither the General Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have
any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or
any Limited Partner and the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
they restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify the duties and liabilities,
including fiduciary duties, of the General Partner or any other Indemnitee
otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace
such other duties and liabilities of the General Partner or such other
Indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to

 



     

 

 



 

the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the General Partner nor any other
Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities, including fiduciary duties,
to Series A Preferred Unitholders.

 



 

(g) The Unitholders hereby have authorized or authorize the General Partner,
on behalf of the Partnership as a general partner or managing member of a
Group Member, to approve actions by the general partner or managing member of
such Group Member similar to those actions permitted to be taken by the
General Partner pursuant to this _Section 7.9_.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Other Matters Concerning the General Partner_.

 



 

(a) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may rely and shall be
protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

 



 

(b) The General Partner and any other Indemnitee may consult with legal
counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers
and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken in reliance upon the advice or opinion (including an
Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner or
such Indemnitee, respectively, reasonably believes to be within such Persons
professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been
done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.

 



 

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership or any Group Member.

 



 

Section 7.11 Purchase or Sale of Partnership Interests. The General Partner
may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire Partnership
Interests or Derivative Partnership Interests. As long as Partnership
Interests are held by any Group Member, such Partnership Interests shall not
be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided
herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also
purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Partnership
Interests for its own account, subject to the provisions of _Articles IV_ and
_X_.

 



 

Section 7.12 _Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates_.

 



 

(a) _Demand Registration_. Upon receipt of a Notice from any Holder, the
Partnership shall file with the Commission as promptly as reasonably
practicable a registration statement under the Securities Act (each, a " **
_Registration Statement_** " _)_ providing for the resale of the Registrable
Securities identified in such Notice, which may, at the option of the Holder
giving such Notice, be a Registration Statement that provides for the resale
of the Registrable Securities from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act. The Partnership shall not be required pursuant to this
_Section 7.12(a)_ to file more than one Registration Statement in any twelve-
month period nor to file more than three Registration Statements in the
aggregate. The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such Registration Statement to become effective as soon as reasonably
practicable after the initial filing of the Registration Statement and to
remain effective and available for the resale of the Registrable Securities by
the

 



     

 

 



 

Selling Holders named therein until the earlier of (i) six months following
such Registration Statements effective date and (ii) the date on which all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold.
In the event one or more Holders request in a Notice to dispose of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering
and such Holder or Holders reasonably anticipate gross proceeds from such
Underwritten Offering of at least $20,000,000 in the aggregate, the
Partnership shall retain underwriters that are reasonably acceptable to such
Selling Holders in order to permit such Selling Holders to effect such
disposition through an Underwritten Offering; provided the Partnership shall
have the exclusive right to select the bookrunning managers. The Partnership
and such Selling Holders shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form that is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and take all
reasonable actions as are requested by the managing underwriters to facilitate
the Underwritten Offering and sale of Partnership Interests therein. No Holder
may participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the terms and
conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all
necessary documents and information reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting agreement. In the event that the managing underwriter of
such Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing
that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would
adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten
Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder
requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro
Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will
not have such material and adverse effect. Any Holder may withdraw from such
Underwritten Offering by notice to the Partnership and the managing
underwriter; provided such notice is delivered prior to the launch of such
Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) _Piggyback Registration_. If the Partnership shall propose to file a
Registration Statement (other than pursuant to a demand made pursuant to
_Section 7.12(a)_) for an offering of Partnership Interests for cash (other
than an offering relating solely to an employee benefit plan, an offering
relating to a transaction on Form S-4 or an offering on any registration
statement that does not permit secondary sales), the Partnership shall notify
all Holders of such proposal at least five business days before the proposed
filing date. The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
include such number of Registrable Securities held by any Holder in such
Registration Statement as each Holder shall request in a Notice received by
the Partnership within two business days of such Holders receipt of the
notice from the Partnership. If the Registration Statement about which the
Partnership gives notice under this _Section 7.12(b)_ is for an Underwritten
Offering, then any Holders ability to include its desired amount of
Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement shall be conditioned on
such Holders inclusion of all such Registrable Securities in the Underwritten
Offering; provided that, in the event that the managing underwriter of such
Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing that
in its opinion the inclusion of all or some Registrable Securities would
adversely and materially affect the timing or success of the Underwritten
Offering, the amount of Registrable Securities that each Selling Holder
requested be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced on a Pro
Rata basis to the aggregate amount that the managing underwriter deems will
not have such material and adverse effect. In connection with any such
Underwritten Offering, the Partnership and the Selling Holders involved shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form that is reasonably
acceptable to the Partnership and take all reasonable actions as are requested
by the managing underwriters to facilitate the

 



      

 

 



 

Underwritten Offering and sale of Partnership Interests therein. No Holder may
participate in the Underwritten Offering unless it agrees to sell its
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement on the terms and
conditions of the underwriting agreement and completes and delivers all
necessary documents and information reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting agreement. Any Holder may withdraw from such Underwritten
Offering by notice to the Partnership and the managing underwriter; provided
such notice is delivered prior to the launch of such Underwritten Offering.
The Partnership shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any Registration
Statement or Underwritten Offering initiated by it under this _Section
7.12(b)_ prior to the pricing date of the Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(c) _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under this _Section
7.12_, the Partnership shall:

 



 

(i) furnish to each Selling Holder (A) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and
its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections
reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information
prior to filing a Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto,
and (B) such number of copies of such Registration Statement and the
prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as such
Persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement; provided that the Partnership will not have any obligation to
provide any document pursuant to clause (B) hereof that is available on the
Commissions website;

 



 

(ii) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under
the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders
or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the managing underwriter, shall
reasonably request; provided, however, that the Partnership will not be
required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would subject
it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
subject;

 



 

(iii) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (A)
the filing of a Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus
supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (B) any
written comments from the Commission with respect to any Registration
Statement or any document incorporated by reference therein and any written
request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to a Registration
Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



 

(iv) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (A)
the occurrence

 



     

 

 



 

of any event or existence of any fact (but not a description of such event or
fact) as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained
in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the
case of the prospectus contained therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which a statement is made); (B) the issuance or threat of issuance by
the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement, or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
or (C) the receipt by the Partnership of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under
the applicable securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the
provision of such notice, subject to _Section 7.12(f)_, the Partnership
agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the prospectus or
prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus
or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing and to take such other reasonable action as is
necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings
related thereto; and

 



 

(v) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities,
including the provision of comfort letters and legal opinions as are customary
in such securities offerings.

 



 

(d) _Suspension_. Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the
Partnership of the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section
7.12(c)(iv)_, shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable
Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such
Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by such subsection or until it is advised in writing
by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by
reference in the prospectus.

 



 

(e) _Expenses_. Except as set forth in an underwriting agreement for the
applicable Underwritten Offering or as otherwise agreed between a Selling
Holder and the Partnership, all costs and expenses of a Registration Statement
filed or an Underwritten Offering that includes Registrable Securities
pursuant to this _Section 7.12_ (other than underwriting discounts and
commissions on Registrable Securities and fees and expenses of counsel and
advisors to Selling Holders) shall be paid by the Partnership.

 



 

(f) _Delay Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the
Conflicts Committee determines that the Partnerships compliance with its
obligations in this _Section 7.12_ would be detrimental to the Partnership
because such registration would (x) materially interfere with a significant
acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the
Partnership, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that the
Partnership has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or
(z) render the Partnership unable to comply with requirements under applicable
securities laws, then the Partnership shall have the right to postpone
compliance with such obligations for a period of not more than six months;
provided that such right may not be exercised more than twice in any 24-month
period.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) _Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) In addition to and not in limitation of the Partnerships obligation under
_Section 7.7_, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law
but subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder, its officers, directors and each Person
who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any
agent thereof (collectively, " ** _Indemnified Persons_** ") from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act
or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this _Section 7.12(g)_ as a "claim"
and in the plural as "claims") based upon, arising out of or resulting from
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final
prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus under which any Registrable
Securities were registered or sold by such Selling Holder under the Securities
Act, or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however,
that the Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the
extent that any such claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus
or issuer free writing prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such
Selling Holder specifically for use in the preparation thereof

 



 

(ii) Each Selling Holder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partners officers
and directors and each Person who controls the Partnership (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) and any agent thereof to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only with
respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by
or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in such
Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or free
writing prospectus.

 



 

(iii) The provisions of this _Section 7.12(g)_ shall be in addition to any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that a Person entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 7.12(g)_ may have pursuant to law,
equity, contract or otherwise.

 



 

(h) _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of _Section 7.12_
by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is
therefore agreed that each party, in addition to and without limiting any
other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to an injunction or
other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any
such breach, and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and
each of the parties hereto hereby waives any and all defenses it may have on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an
injunction or other equitable relief. The existence of this right will not
preclude any such party from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or
in equity that such party may have.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 7.13 _Reliance by Third Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any Person (other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates) dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the
General Partner and any officer of the General Partner authorized by the
General Partner to act on behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has
full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any
and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts
on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with
the General Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnerships sole
party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses or other
remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such officer in connection
with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person (other than the General
Partner and its Affiliates) dealing with the General Partner or any such
officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of
this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or
its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution
and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was
in full force and effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such
certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so
for and on behalf of the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or
instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Records and Accounting_. The General Partner shall keep or cause
to be kept at the principal office of the Partnership appropriate books and
records with respect to the Partnerships business, including the Register and
all other books and records necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any
information required to be provided pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_. Any books
and records maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the regular
course of its business, including the Register, books of account and records
of Partnership proceedings, may be kept on, or be in the form of, computer
disks, hard drives, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs, micrographics or
any other information storage device; provided, that the books and records so
maintained are convertible into clearly legible written form within a
reasonable period of time. The books of the Partnership shall be maintained,
for financial reporting purposes, on an accrual basis in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The Partnership shall not be required to keep books maintained on a cash
basis and the General Partner shall be permitted to calculate cash-based
measures by making such adjustments to its accrual basis books to account for
non-cash items and other adjustments as the General Partner determines to be
necessary or appropriate.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be a
fiscal year ending December 31.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 8.3 _Reports_.

 



 

(a) Whether or not the Partnership is subject to the requirement to file
reports with the Commission, as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than 105 days after the close of each fiscal year of the Partnership (or such
shorter period as required by the Commission), the General Partner shall cause
to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable means (including posting on
or accessible through the Partnerships or the Commissions website) to each
Record Holder of a Unit as of a date selected by the General Partner, an
annual report containing financial statements of the Partnership for such
fiscal year of the Partnership, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
including a balance sheet and statements of operations, Partnership equity and
cash flows, such statements to be audited by a firm of independent public
accountants selected by the General Partner, and such other information as may
be required by applicable law, regulation or rule of the Commission or any
National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to
trading, or as the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

 



 

(b) Whether or not the Partnership is subject to the requirement to file
reports with the Commission, as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than 50 days after the close of each Quarter (or such shorter period as
required by the Commission) except the last Quarter of each fiscal year, the
General Partner shall cause to be mailed or made available, by any reasonable
means (including posting on or accessible through the Partnerships or the
Commissions website) to each Record Holder of a Unit, as of a date selected
by the General Partner, a report containing unaudited financial statements of
the Partnership and such other information as may be required by applicable
law, regulation or rule of the Commission or any National Securities Exchange
on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, or as the General
Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 9.1 _Tax Returns and Information_. The Partnership shall timely file
all returns of the Partnership that are required for federal, state and local
income tax purposes on the basis of the accrual method and the taxable period
or year that it is required by law to adopt, from time to time, as determined
by the General Partner. In the event the Partnership is required to use a
taxable period other than a year ending on December 31, the General Partner
shall use reasonable efforts to change the taxable period of the Partnership
to a year ending on December 31. The tax information reasonably required by
Record Holders for federal and state income tax reporting purposes with
respect to a taxable period shall be furnished to them within 90 days of the
close of the calendar year in which the Partnerships taxable period ends. The
classification, realization and recognition of income, gain, losses and
deductions and other items shall be on the accrual method of accounting for
federal income tax purposes.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Tax Elections_.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partners
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for

 



     

 

 



 

the purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code,
the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a
convention whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner
Interest will be deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited
Partner Interests on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited
Partner Interests are listed or admitted to trading during the calendar month
in which such transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_
without regard to the actual price paid by such transferee.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine
whether the Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Tax Controversies_.

 



 

(a) For taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, the General
Partner is designated as the Tax Matters Partner. For each taxable year
beginning after December 31, 2017, the General Partner shall be or shall
designate the Partnership Representative and any other Persons necessary to
conduct proceedings under Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code (as amended
by the BBA) for such year. Any such designated Person or Persons shall serve
at the pleasure of, and act at the direction of, the General Partner. The
Partnership Representative, as directed by the General Partner, shall exercise
any and all authority of the "partnership representative" under the Code (as
amended by the BBA), including, without limitation, (i) binding the
Partnership and its Partners with respect to actions taken under Subchapter C
of Chapter 63 of the Code (as amended by the BBA), and (ii) determining
whether to make any available election under Section 6226 of the Code (as
amended by the BBA).

 



 

(b) The General Partner (acting through the Partnership Representative to the
extent permitted by _Section 9.3(a)_) is authorized and required to act on
behalf of and represent the Partnership (at the Partnerships expense) in
connection with all examinations of the Partnerships affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and
the General Partner is authorized to expend Partnership funds for professional
services and costs associated therewith.

 



 

(c) Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner (or its
designee) and to do or refrain from doing any or all things reasonably
requested by the General Partner (or its designee) in its capacity as the Tax
Matters Partner or the Partnership Representative, or as a person otherwise
authorized and required to act on behalf of and represent the Partnership
pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_.

 



 

(d) The General Partner is authorized to amend the provisions of this
Agreement as appropriate to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury
Regulations implementing or interpreting the partnership audit, assessment and
collection rules adopted by the BBA, including any amendments to those rules.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Withholding and other Tax Payments by the Partnership_.

 



 

(a) If taxes and related interest, penalties or additions to tax are paid by
the Partnership on behalf of all or less than all the Partners or former
Partners (including, without limitation, any payment by the Partnership of an
Imputed Underpayment), the General Partner may treat such payment as a
distribution of cash to such Partners, treat such payment as a general

 



     

 

 



 

expense of the Partnership, or, in the case of an Imputed Underpayment,
require that persons who were Partners of the Partnership in the taxable year
to which the payment relates (including former Partners) indemnify the
Partnership upon request for their allocable share of that payment, in each
case as determined appropriate under the circumstances by the General Partner.
The amount of any such indemnification obligation of, or deemed distribution
of cash to, a Partner or former Partner in respect of an Imputed Underpayment
shall be reduced to the extent that the Partnership receives a reduction in
the amount of the Imputed Underpayment which, in the determination of the
General Partner, is attributable to actions taken by, the tax status or
attributes of, or tax information provided by or attributable to, such Partner
or former Partner pursuant to or described in Section 6225(c) of the Code (as
amended by the BBA).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause the Partnership
and other Group Members to comply with any withholding requirements
established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that
the Partnership is required or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing
authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income
or from a distribution to any Partner (including by reason of Section 1446 of
the Code), the General Partner may treat the amount withheld as a distribution
of cash pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ or _Section 12.4(c)_ in the amount of
such withholding from such Partner.

pursuant to _Article XIV_, and except as provided in _Section 4.8_, each
transferee of, or other such Person acquiring, a Limited Partner Interest
(including any nominee, agent or representative acquiring such Limited Partner
Interests for the account of another Person or Group, which nominee, agent or
representative shall be subject to _Section 10.1(c)_ below) (i) was or shall
be admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner with respect to the

Agreement by such Person. The transfer of any Limited Partner Interests and
the admission of any new Limited Partner shall not constitute an amendment to
this Agreement. A Person may become a Limited Partner without the consent or
approval of any of the Partners. A Person may not become a Limited Partner
without acquiring a Limited Partner Interest and becoming the Record Holder of
such Limited Partner Interest. The

 



     

 

 



 

rights and obligations of a Person who is an Ineligible Holder shall be
determined in accordance with _Section 4.8_.

 



 

(c) With respect to Units that are held for a Persons account by another
Person that is the Record Holder (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), such
Record Holder shall, in exercising the rights of a Limited Partner in respect
of such Units, including the right to vote, on any matter, and unless the
arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, take all action as a
Limited Partner by virtue of being the Record Holder of such Units in
accordance with the direction of the Person who is the beneficial owner of
such Units, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume such Record Holder
is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this _Section
10.1(c)_ are subject to the provisions of _Section 4.3_.

 



 

(d) The name and mailing address of each Record Holder shall be listed in the
Register. The General Partner shall update the Register from time to time as
necessary to reflect accurately the information therein (or shall cause the
Transfer Agent to do so, as applicable).

 



 

(e) Any transfer of a Limited Partner Interest shall not entitle the
transferee to share in the profits and losses, to receive distributions, to
receive allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or any similar
item or to any other rights to which the transferor was entitled until the
transferee becomes a Limited Partner pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Admission of Successor General Partner_. A successor General
Partner approved pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ or the
transferee of or successor to all of the General Partner Interest pursuant to
_Section 4.6_ who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner
shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective
immediately prior to the withdrawal or removal of the predecessor or
transferring General Partner, pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_
or the transfer of the General Partner Interest pursuant to _Section 4.6_,
provided, however, that no such successor shall be admitted to the Partnership
until compliance with the terms of _Section 4.6_ has occurred and such
successor has executed and delivered such other documents or instruments as
may be required to effect such admission. Any such successor is hereby
authorized to and shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on the business of
the members of the Partnership Group without dissolution.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership_.
To effect the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner
shall take all steps necessary or appropriate under the Delaware Act to amend
the Register and any other records of the Partnership to reflect such
admission and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practicable an amendment to
this Agreement and, if required by law, the General Partner shall prepare and
file an amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership.

a trust, the termination of the trust; (D) if the General Partner is a natural
person, his death or adjudication of incompetency; and (E) otherwise upon the
termination of the General Partner.

 



 

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _(v)_ or
_(vi)(A)_ , _(B)_ , _(C)_ or _(E)_ occurs, the withdrawing General Partner
shall give notice to the Limited Partners within 30 days after such
occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of Withdrawal
described in this _Section 11.1_ shall result in the withdrawal of the
General Partner from the Partnership.

 



 

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
under the following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning
on the IPO Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, Central Time, on June
30, 2022 the General Partner voluntarily

 



     

 

 



 

withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance notice of its intention to
withdraw to the Limited Partners; provided, that prior to the effective date
of such withdrawal, the withdrawal is approved by Unitholders holding at least
a majority of the Outstanding Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) and Outstanding Series A Preferred Units
(with such Series A Preferred Units to be treated on an as-converted basis as
described in _Section 5.11(b)(v)_), voting together as a single class, and
the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an Opinion of Counsel _(_ " **
_Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel_** " _)_ that such withdrawal (following the
selection of the successor General Partner) would not result in the loss of
the limited liability under the Delaware Act of any Limited Partner or cause
any Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed); (ii) at any time after 12:00
midnight, Central Time, on June 30, 2022 the General Partner voluntarily
withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance notice to the Unitholders, such
withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such notice; (iii) at any
time that the General Partner ceases to be the General Partner pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(ii)_ or is removed pursuant to _Section 11.2_; or (iv)
notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at any time that the General
Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days advance notice of
its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take
effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the time such notice is
given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the
Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership
upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or managing member, if
any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the General
Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_, the
holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person so elected as
successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member. Any successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 11.1_ shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Removal of the General Partner_. The General Partner may be
removed if such removal is approved by the Unitholders holding at least 66
2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units held by the General Partner and
its Affiliates) voting as a single class. Any such action by such holders for
removal of the General Partner must also provide for the election of a
successor General Partner by a Unit Majority. Such removal shall be effective
immediately following the admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to
_Section 10.2_. The removal of the General Partner shall also automatically
constitute the removal of the General Partner as general partner or managing
member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the
General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If a Person is
elected as a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 11.2_, such Person shall, upon admission pursuant to _Section
10.2_, automatically become a successor general partner or managing member, to
the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner
is a general partner or a managing member. The right of the holders of
Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall not exist or be
exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the
matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.2_ shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 10.2_.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 11.3 _Interest of Departing General Partner and Successor General
Partner_.

 



 

(a) In the event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances
where such withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the
General Partner by the holders of Outstanding Units under circumstances where
Cause does not exist, if the successor General Partner is elected in
accordance with the terms of _Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, the Departing
General Partner shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date
of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing General Partner, to require its
successor to purchase its General Partner Interest and its or its Affiliates
general partner interest (or equivalent interest), if any, in the other Group
Members (collectively, the " ** _Combined Interest_** ") in exchange for an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such
amount to be determined and payable as of the effective date of its withdrawal
or removal. If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under
circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under
circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a
successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of _Section
11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ (or if the business of the Partnership is continued
pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and the successor General Partner is not the
former General Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable
prior to the effective date of the withdrawal or removal of such Departing
General Partner (or, in the event the business of the Partnership is
continued, prior to the date the business of the Partnership is continued), to
purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined
Interest. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to
receive all reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to
_Section 7.4_, including any employee-related liabilities (including
severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any
employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its Affiliates (other
than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group
Members.

 



 

For purposes of this _Section 11.3(a)_, the fair market value of the Combined
Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General
Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the
effective date of such Departing General Partners withdrawal or removal, by
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by
the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on
other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such
matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking
firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of
such withdrawal or removal, then the Departing General Partner shall designate
an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the
Departing General Partners successor shall designate an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts
shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or
independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other
independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined
Interest. In making its determination, such third independent investment
banking firm or other independent expert may consider the then current trading
price of Units on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then
listed or admitted to trading, the value of the Partnerships assets, the
rights and obligations of the Departing General Partner, the value of the
General Partner Interest and other factors it may deem relevant.

 



 

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
_Section 11.3(a)_, the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) shall
become a Limited Partner

 



     

 

 



 

and its Combined Interest shall be converted into Common Units pursuant to a
valuation made by an investment banking firm or other independent expert
selected pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_, without reduction in such Partnership
Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of the admission of
its successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing
General Partner (or its transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of the
Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing General
Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner. For purposes of this
Agreement, conversion of the Combined Interest of the Departing General
Partner to Common Units will be characterized as if the Departing General
Partner (or its transferee) contributed its Combined Interest to the
Partnership in exchange for the newly issued Common Units.

 



 

(c) If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
_Section 11.1_ or _Section 11.2_ (or if the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to _Section 12.2_ and the successor General Partner is not
the former General Partner) and the option described in _Section 11.3(a)_ is
not exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner
shall, at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute
to the Partnership cash in the amount equal to the product of (x) the quotient
obtained by dividing (A) the Percentage Interest of the General Partner
Interest of the Departing General Partner by (B) a percentage equal to 100%
less the Percentage Interest of the General Partner Interest of the Departing
General Partner and (y) the Net Agreed Value of the Partnerships assets on
such date. In such event, such successor General Partner shall, subject to the
following sentence, be entitled to its Percentage Interest of all Partnership
allocations and distributions to which the Departing General Partner was
entitled. In addition, the successor General Partner shall cause this
Agreement to be amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such
successor General Partners admission, the successor General Partners
interest in all Partnership distributions and allocations shall be its
Percentage Interest.

 



 

Section 11.4 _Withdrawal of Limited Partners_. No Limited Partner shall have
any right to withdraw from the Partnership; provided, however, that when a
transferee of a Limited Partners Limited Partner Interest becomes a Record
Holder of the Limited Partner Interest so transferred, such transferring
Limited Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the
Limited Partner Interest so transferred.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION**

 



 

Section 12.1 _Dissolution_. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the
admission of additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General Partner
is elected pursuant to _Section 11.1_, _Section 11.2_ or _Section 12.2_,
the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor General Partner
shall continue the business of the Partnership. The Partnership shall
dissolve, and (subject to _Section 12.2_) its affairs shall be wound up,
upon:

 



 

(a) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in _Section
11.1(a)_ (other than _Section 11.1(a)(ii)_), unless a successor is elected
and a Withdrawal

 



     

 

 



 

Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in _Section 11.1(b)_ or _11.2_ and
such successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to _Section 10.2_;

 



 

(b) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that is
approved by the holders of a Unit Majority;

 



 

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

 



 

(d) at any time there are no Limited Partners, unless the Partnership is
continued without dissolution in accordance with the Delaware Act.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Continuation of the Business of the Partnership After
Dissolution_. Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of
Withdrawal caused by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as
provided in _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ or _(iii)_ and the failure of the Partners
to select a successor to such Departing General Partner pursuant to _Section
11.1_ or _Section 11.2_, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within
90 days thereafter, or (b) dissolution of the Partnership upon an event
constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_,
_(v)_ or _(vi)_ , then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, within 180
days thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the
business of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement by appointing as a successor General Partner a Person approved by
the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the
applicable time period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only
activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made,
then:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue without dissolution unless earlier
dissolved in accordance with this _Article XII_;

 



 

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner, then
the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated in the manner
provided in _Section 11.3_; and

 



 

(iii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement;

 



 

provided, that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a
successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act
and (y) neither the Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue (to
the extent not already so treated or taxed).

 



 

Section 12.3 _Liquidator_. Upon dissolution of the Partnership in accordance
with the provisions of _Article XII_, the General Partner shall select one or
more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General
Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as
may be approved by holders of a Unit Majority. The Liquidator (if other than

 



     

 

 



 

the General Partner) shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days
prior notice and may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by notice
of removal approved by a Unit Majority. Upon dissolution, removal or
resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who
shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original
Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by a Unit Majority.
The right to approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner
provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any such successor or
substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided. Except as
expressly provided in this _Article XII_, the Liquidator approved in the
manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further
authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers
conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but
subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon
the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in
_Section 7.3_) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and functions
of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time required to
complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for
herein.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Liquidation_. The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the
assets of the Partnership, discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up
its affairs in such manner and over such period as determined by the
Liquidator, subject to Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:

 



 

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution
in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such
Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the
Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of _Section
12.4(c)_ to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and
contemporaneously therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to
the other Partners. The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of
the Partnerships assets for a reasonable time if it determines that an
immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnerships assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The Liquidator
may distribute the Partnerships assets, in whole or in part, in kind if it
determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Partners.

 



 

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of _Section
12.3_) and amounts owed to Partners otherwise than in respect of their
distribution rights under _Article VI_. With respect to any liability that is
contingent, conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable,
the Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as
additional liquidation proceeds.

 



 

(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge
liabilities as provided in _Section 12.4(b)_ and that required to satisfy
liquidation preferences of the Series A Preferred Units provided for under
_Section 5.11(b)(x)_ shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with,
and to the extent of, the positive balances in their respective Capital
Accounts, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account
adjustments (other than those made by reason of distributions pursuant to this
_Section 12.4(c)_) for the taxable period of the Partnership during which the
liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such date of occurrence being
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and
such distribution

 



     

 

 



 

shall be made by the end of such taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days
after said date of such occurrence); provided that any property or cash
(including cash equivalents) available for distribution under this _Section
12.4(c)_ shall be distributed with respect to the Series A Preferred Units,
Series A Parity Securities and Series A Senior Securities (up to the positive
balances in the associated Capital Accounts) prior to any distribution of
property or cash (including cash equivalents) with respect to the Series A
Junior Securities.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership_. Upon the
completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in
_Section 12.4_ in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership
as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of
Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be necessary to
terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

 



 

Section 12.6 _Return of Contributions_. The General Partner shall not be
personally liable for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any
monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return
of the Capital Contributions of the Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any
portion thereof, it being expressly understood that any such return shall be
made solely from assets of the Partnership.

 



 

Section 12.7 _Waiver of Partition_. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of the Partnership property.

 



 

Section 12.8 _Capital Account Restoration_. No Limited Partner shall have any
obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon
liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to
restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its
interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership
during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the
date of such liquidation.

Section 13.2 _Amendment Procedures_. Amendments to this Agreement may be
proposed only by the General Partner. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
the General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose or approve any

Person bound by this Agreement, and, in declining to propose or approve an
amendment to this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law shall not
be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at

any amendment to this Agreement shall be permitted to do so in its sole and
absolute discretion. An amendment to this Agreement shall be effective upon
its approval by the General Partner and, except as otherwise provided by
_Section 13.1_ or _Section 13.3_, the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a
greater or different percentage of Outstanding Units is required under this
Agreement. Each proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders

as applicable, shall be set forth in a writing that contains the text of the
proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner

Unitholders to consider and vote on such proposed amendment. The General
Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final adoption of any amendments.
The General Partner shall be deemed to have notified all Record Holders as
required by this _Section 13.2_ if it has posted or made accessible such
amendment through the Partnerships or the Commissions website.

 



 

Section 13.3 _Amendment Requirements_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_, no
provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units
(including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) or of a particular class
of Outstanding Units, as applicable, required to take any action shall be
amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would
have the effect of (i) in the case of any provision of this Agreement other
than _Section 11.2_ or _Section 13.4_, reducing such percentage or (ii) in
the case of _Section 11.2_ or _Section 13.4_, increasing such percentages,
unless such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative
vote of holders of Outstanding Units (or holders of Outstanding Units of such
applicable class, as the case may be) whose aggregate Outstanding Units
(generally or such applicable class, as the case may be) constitute (x) in the
case of a reduction as described in subclause (a)(i) hereof, not less than the
voting requirement sought to be reduced, (y) in the case of an increase in the
percentage in _Section 11.2_, not less than 90% of the Outstanding Units, or
(z)

 



     

 

 



 

in the case of an increase in the percentage in _Section 13.4_, not less than
a majority of the Outstanding Units.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 13.1_ and _Section 13.2_, no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited
Partner without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a
result of an amendment approved pursuant to _Section 13.3(c)_ or (ii) enlarge
the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce
in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to,
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which
consent may be given or withheld at its option.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in _Section 14.3_, and without limitation of the
General Partners authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the
approval of any Partners as contemplated in _Section 13.1_, any amendment
that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any
class or sub-class of Partnership Interests in relation to other classes or
sub-classes, as applicable, of Partnership Interests must be approved by the
holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Partnership Interests
of the class or sub-class, as applicable, affected.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to _Section 13.1_ and except as otherwise provided by
_Section 14.3(b)_, no amendments shall become effective without the approval
of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single
class unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
such amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner
under applicable partnership law of the state under whose laws the Partnership
is organized.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in _Section 13.1_, this _Section 13.3_ shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

 



 

Section 13.4 _Special Meetings_. All acts of Limited Partners to be taken
pursuant to this Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this
_Article XIII_. Special meetings of the Limited Partners may be called by the
General Partner or by Limited Partners owning 20% or more of the Outstanding
Units of the class or classes for which a meeting is proposed. Limited
Partners shall call a special meeting by delivering to the General Partner one
or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited Partners wish to
call a special meeting and indicating the specific purposes for which the
special meeting is to be called and the class or classes of Units for which
the meeting is proposed. No business may be brought by any Limited Partner
before such special meeting except the business listed in the related request.
Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within
such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply
with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar
requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies
for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall send a notice of the
meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly. A meeting shall
be held at a time and place determined by the General Partner on a date not
less than 10 days nor more than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting
is given as provided in _Section 16.1_. Limited Partners shall not be
permitted to vote on matters that would cause the Limited Partners to be
deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and
affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners

 



     

 

 



 

limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other state in
which the Partnership is qualified to do business. If any such vote were to
take place, it shall be deemed null and void to the extent necessary so as not
to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability under the Delaware Act
or the law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do
business.

 



 

Section 13.5 _Notice of a Meeting_. Notice of a meeting called pursuant to
_Section 13.4_ shall be given to the Record Holders of the class or classes
of Units for which a meeting is proposed in writing by mail or other means of
written communication in accordance with _Section 16.1_.

 



 

Section 13.6 _Record Date_. For purposes of determining the Limited Partners
who are Record Holders of the class or classes of Limited Partner Interests
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to
give approvals without a meeting as provided in _Section 13.11_, the General
Partner shall set a Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than
60 days before (a) the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts
with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities
Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to trading or U.S. federal
securities laws, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of such National Securities Exchange or U.S. federal securities laws shall
govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting, the
date by which such Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General
Partner to give such approvals.

 



 

Section 13.7 _Postponement and Adjournment_. Prior to the date upon which any
meeting of Limited Partners is to be held, the General Partner may postpone
such meeting one or more times for any reason by giving notice to each Limited
Partner entitled to vote at the meeting so postponed of the place, date and
hour at which such meeting would be held. Such notice shall be given not fewer
than two days before the date of such meeting and otherwise in accordance with
this _Article XIII_. When a meeting is postponed, a new Record Date need not
be fixed unless the aggregate amount of such postponement shall be for more
than 45 days after the original meeting date. Any meeting of Limited Partners
may be adjourned by the General Partner one or more times for any reason,
including the failure of a quorum to be present at the meeting with respect to
any proposal or the failure of any proposal to receive sufficient votes for
approval. No vote of the Limited Partners shall be required for any
adjournment. A meeting of Limited Partners may be adjourned by the General
Partner as to one or more proposals regardless of whether action has been
taken on other matters. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need
not be fixed, if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than
45 days. At the adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than 45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with
this _Article XIII_.

 



 

Section 13.8 _Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting_. The transactions of any
meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and whenever held,
shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a meeting duly held after call and
notice in accordance with _Sections 13.4_ and _13.5_ , if a quorum is present
either in person or by proxy. Attendance of a Limited Partner at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of the meeting, except when the Limited
Partner attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance

 



     

 

 



 

at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove of any matters
submitted for consideration or to object to the failure to submit for
consideration any matters required to be included in the notice of the
meeting, but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the
beginning of the meeting.

 



 

Section 13.9 _Quorum and Voting_. The presence, in person or by proxy, of
holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for
which a meeting has been called (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by
the General Partner and its Affiliates) shall constitute a quorum at a meeting
of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the
Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such
Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any
meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this
Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the
Outstanding Units entitled to vote at such meeting shall be deemed to
constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a different percentage or
class vote is required with respect to such action under the provisions of
this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such different
percentage or the act of the Limited Partners holding the requisite percentage
of the necessary class, as applicable, shall be required. The Limited Partners
present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the exit of
enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken
(other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of Outstanding
Units or the required percentage of Outstanding Units of the applicable class,
as the case may be, specified in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.10 _Conduct of a Meeting_. The General Partner shall have full
power and authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the
Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including the
determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the
satisfaction of the requirements of _Section 13.4_, the conduct of voting,
the validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any
controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the
meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a Person to serve as
chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a Person to take the
minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the records of the
Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General Partner may make
such other regulations consistent with applicable law and this Agreement as it
may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting of the Limited
Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including regulations in
regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors
of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of proxies and other
evidence of the right to vote, and the submission and revocation of approvals
in writing.

 



 

Section 13.11 _Action Without a Meeting_ _._ If authorized by the General
Partner, any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Limited Partners may
be taken without a meeting if an approval in writing setting forth the action
so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum
percentage of the Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned by the
General Partner and its Affiliates) that would be necessary to authorize or
take such action at a meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present
and voted (unless such provision conflicts with any rule, regulation,
guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the
Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which case the rule, regulation,
guideline or

 



     

 

 



 

requirement of such National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice
of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited
Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify
that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of
taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership
within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the
General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of
the Outstanding Units held by such Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be
deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Outstanding Units that were
not voted. If approval of the taking of any permitted action by the Limited
Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the General
Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until
(a) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are deposited with the
Partnership in care of the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take
the action proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the
date sufficient approvals are first deposited with the Partnership and (c) an
Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the
exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any
particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be
taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the
Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability, and
(ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the
rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.

 



 

Section 13.12 _Right to Vote and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set
pursuant to _Section 13.6_ (and also subject to the limitations contained in
the definition of "Outstanding") shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote
at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to
which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act.
All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken
by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or
acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.

 



 

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Persons account by another
Person that is the Record Holder (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust
company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), such
Record Holder shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units
on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides
otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and in accordance with the direction
of, the Person who is the beneficial owner of such Units, and the Partnership
shall be entitled to assume such Record Holder is so acting without further
inquiry. The provisions of this _Section 13.12(b)_ (as well as all other
provisions of this Agreement) are subject to the provisions of _Section 4.3_.

the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, shall direct that the Merger
Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as applicable, be submitted to a vote of
Limited Partners, whether at a special meeting or by written consent, in
either case in accordance with the requirements of _Article XIII_. A copy or
a summary of the Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may
be, shall be included in or enclosed with the notice of a special meeting or
the written consent and, subject to any applicable

 



     

 

 



 

requirements of Regulation 14A pursuant to the Exchange Act or successor
provision, no other disclosure regarding the proposed merger, consolidation or
conversion shall be required.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 14.3(d)_ and _Section 14.3(e)_, the
Merger Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, shall be approved
upon receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of a Unit
Majority unless the Merger Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may
be, effects an amendment to any provision of this Agreement that, if contained
in an amendment to this Agreement adopted pursuant to _Article XIII_, would
require for its approval the vote or consent of a greater percentage of the
Outstanding Units or of any class of Limited Partners, in which case such
greater percentage vote or consent shall be required for approval of the
Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 14.3(d)_ and _Section 14.3(e)_, after
such approval by vote or consent of the Limited Partners, and at any time
prior to the filing of the certificate of merger or articles of conversion
pursuant to _Section 14.4_, the merger, consolidation or conversion may be
abandoned pursuant to provisions therefor, if any, set forth in the Merger
Agreement or Plan of Conversion, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this _Article XIV_ or in this
Agreement, but subject to _Section 5.11(b)(vi)_, the General Partner is
permitted, without Limited Partner approval, to convert the Partnership or any
Group Member into a new limited liability entity, to merge the Partnership or
any Group Member into, or convey all of the Partnerships assets to, another
limited liability entity that shall be newly formed and shall have no assets,
liabilities or operations at the time of such conversion, merger or conveyance
other than those it receives from the Partnership or other Group Member if (i)
the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the conversion,
merger or conveyance, as the case may be, would not result in the loss of
limited liability under the laws of the jurisdiction governing the other
limited liability entity (if that jurisdiction is not Delaware) of any Limited
Partner as compared to its limited liability under the Delaware Act or cause
the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose of such
conversion, merger, or conveyance is to effect a mere change in the legal form
of the Partnership into another limited liability entity and (iii) the General
Partner determines that the governing instruments of the new entity provide
the Limited Partners and the General Partner with substantially the same
rights and obligations as are herein contained.

 



 

(d) Additionally, notwithstanding anything else contained in this _Article
XIV_ or in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 5.11(b)(vi)_, the General
Partner is permitted, without Limited Partner approval, to merge or
consolidate the Partnership with or into another limited liability entity if
(i) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the merger or
consolidation, as the case may be, would not result in the loss of the limited
liability of any Limited Partner under the laws of the jurisdiction governing
the other limited liability entity (if that jurisdiction is not Delaware) as
compared to its limited liability under the Delaware Act or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the merger or consolidation would
not result in an amendment to this Agreement, other than any amendments that
could be adopted pursuant to _Section 13.1_, (iii) the Partnership is the
Surviving

 



     

 

 



 

Business Entity in such merger or consolidation, (iv) each Unit outstanding
immediately prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation is to
be an identical Unit of the Partnership after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, and (v) the number of Partnership Interests to be issued by
the Partnership in such merger or consolidation does not exceed 20% of the
Partnership Interests Outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of
such merger or consolidation.

 



 

(e) Pursuant to Section 17-211(g) of the Delaware Act, an agreement of merger
or consolidation approved in accordance with this _Article XIV_ may (i)
effect any amendment to this Agreement or (ii) effect the adoption of a new
partnership agreement for the Partnership if it is the Surviving Business
Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made pursuant to this _Section 14.3_
shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
consolidation.

 



 

Section 14.4 _Certificate of Merger or Certificate of Conversion_. Upon the
required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of a Merger
Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, a certificate of
merger or certificate of conversion or other filing, as applicable, shall be
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or the
appropriate filing office of any other jurisdiction, as applicable, in
conformity with the requirements of the Delaware Act or other applicable law.

 



 

Section 14.5 _Effect of Merger, Consolidation or Conversion_.

 



 

(a) At the effective time of the merger:

 



 

(i) all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the business entities
that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and
causes of action belonging to each of those business entities, shall be vested
in the Surviving Business Entity and after the merger or consolidation shall
be the property of the Surviving Business Entity to the extent they were of
each constituent business entity;

 



 

(ii) the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise in any of
those constituent business entities shall not revert and is not in any way
impaired because of the merger or consolidation;

 



 

(iii) all rights of creditors and all liens on or security interests in
property of any of those constituent business entities shall be preserved
unimpaired; and

 



 

(iv) all debts, liabilities and duties of those constituent business entities
shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity and may be enforced against it
to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred
or contracted by it.

 



 

(b) At the effective time of the conversion:

 



 

(i) the Partnership shall continue to exist, without interruption, but in the
organizational form of the converted entity rather than in its prior
organizational form;

 



 

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall continue to be owned by the converted entity in
its new

deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but subject to
any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon;

 



 

(iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership shall continue to be
liabilities and obligations of the converted entity in its new organizational
form without impairment or diminution by reason of the conversion;

 



 

(iv) all rights of creditors or other parties with respect to or against the

(v) a proceeding pending by or against the Partnership or by or against any of
Partners in their capacities as such may be continued by or against the
converted entity in its new organizational form and by or against the prior
partners without any need for substitution of parties; and

 



 

(vi) the Partnership Interests that are to be converted into partnership
interests, shares, evidences of ownership, or other securities in the
converted entity as provided in the plan of conversion shall be so converted,
and Partners shall be entitled only to the rights provided in the Plan of
Conversion.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XV 
RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS**

 



 

Section 15.1 _Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except _Section
5.11(b)(vi)_, if at any time the General Partner and its Affiliates hold more
than 80% of the total Limited Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding
(excluding Series A Preferred Units), the General Partner shall then have the
right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in part to the
Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable at its
option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Limited Partner
Interests (but excluding the Series A Preferred Units, which are subject to
_Section 5.11(b)(vi)_) of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other
than the General Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current
Market Price as of the date three Business Days prior to the date that the
notice described in _Section 15.1(b)_ is mailed and (y) the highest price
paid by the General Partner or any of its Affiliates for any such Limited
Partner Interest of such class purchased during the 90-day period preceding
the date that the notice described in _Section 15.1(b)_ is mailed.

 



 

(b) If the General Partner any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to _Section 15.1(a)_, the General Partner shall deliver to
the applicable Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the " **
_Notice of Election to Purchase_** ") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to
mail a copy of such Notice of Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of
Limited Partner Interests of such class (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner), together with such information as may be required by law,
rule or regulation, at least 10, but not more than 60, days

 



     

 

 



 

prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be
filed and distributed as may be required by the Commission or any National
Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed. The
Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price
(determined in accordance with _Section 15.1(a)_) at which Limited Partner
Interests will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its Affiliate
or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Limited
Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests, in the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by
Certificates, or instructions agreeing to such redemption in exchange for
payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent
may specify, or as may be required by any National Securities Exchange on
which such Limited Partner Interests are listed. Any such Notice of Election
to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited Partner Interests at his
address as reflected in the Register shall be conclusively presumed to have
been given regardless of whether the owner receives such notice. On or prior
to the Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership,
as the case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent or exchange agent
cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of
such Limited Partner Interests to be purchased in accordance with this
_Section 15.1_. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall have been duly
given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date, and if on or
prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding sentence has
been made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner Interests subject
to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase Date,
notwithstanding that any Certificate or redemption instructions shall not have
been surrendered for purchase or provided, respectively, all rights of the
holders of such Limited Partner Interests (including any rights pursuant to
_Article IV_, _Article V_, _Article VI_, and _Article XII_) shall
thereupon cease, except the right to receive the purchase price (determined in
accordance with _Section 15.1(a)_) for Limited Partner Interests therefor,
without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates
representing such Limited Partner Interests, in the case of Limited Partner
Interests evidenced by Certificates, or instructions agreeing to such
redemption, and such Limited Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be
transferred to the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, in the Register, and the General Partner or any Affiliate of the
General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be
the Record Holder of all such Limited Partner Interests from and after the
Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the Record Holder of such Limited
Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner
Interests pursuant to _Article IV_, _Article V_, _Article VI_ and _Article
XII_).

 



 

(c) In the case of Limited Partner Interests evidenced by Certificates, at any
time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding Limited
Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this _Section 15.1_ may
surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in _Section
15.1(a)_, therefor, without interest thereon, in accordance with procedures
set forth by the General Partner.

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XVI 
GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

Section 16.1 _Addresses and Notices; Written Communications_.

 



 

(a) Any notice, demand, request, report or proxy materials required or
permitted to be given or made to a Partner under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given or made when delivered in person or when
sent by first class United States mail or by other means of written
communication to the Partner at the address described below. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any notice, payment or report to be given or made
to a Partner hereunder shall be deemed conclusively to have been given or
made, and the obligation to give such notice or report or to make such payment
shall be deemed conclusively to have been fully satisfied, upon sending of
such notice, payment or report to the Record Holder of such Partnership
Interests at his address as shown in the Register, regardless of any claim of
any Person who may have an interest in such Partnership Interests by reason of
any assignment or otherwise. An affidavit or certificate of making of any
notice, payment or report in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
16.1_ executed by the General Partner, the Transfer Agent or the mailing
organization shall be prima facie evidence of the giving or making of such
notice, payment or report. If any notice, payment or report addressed to a
Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing in the Register
is returned by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate that the
United States Postal Service is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or
report and any subsequent notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to
have been duly given or made without further mailing (until such time as such
Record Holder or another Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership
of a change in his address) if they are available for the Partner at the
principal office of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of
the giving or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners.
Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received by the General
Partner at the principal office of the Partnership designated pursuant to
_Section 2.3_. The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in relying
on any notice or other document from a Partner or other Person if believed by
it to be genuine.

 



 

(b) The terms "in writing," "written communications," "written notice" and
words of similar import shall be deemed satisfied under this Agreement by use

 **ARTICLE II.** 
**REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

 **Section 2.01** **_Shelf Registration._**

 



 

(a) **_Shelf Registration_**. The Partnership shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) prepare and file an initial registration statement
under the Securities Act to permit the resale of Registrable Securities from
time to time as permitted by Rule 415 (or any similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) of the Securities Act (a " ** _Registration
Statement_** ") and (ii) cause such initial Registration Statement to become
effective no later than the second anniversary of the date hereof (the " **
_Target Effective Date_** "). The Partnership will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such initial Registration Statement filed pursuant
to this _Section 2.01(a)_ to be continuously effective under the Securities
Act, with respect to any Holder, until the earliest to occur of the following:
(A) the date on which there are no longer any Registrable Securities
outstanding and (B) the second anniversary of the date on which all Series A
Preferred Units have been converted into Common Units (in each case of clause
(A) or (B) the " ** _Effectiveness Period_** "). A Registration Statement
filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ shall be on such appropriate
registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by the Partnership;
_provided that_ , if the Partnership is then eligible, it shall file such
Registration Statement on Form S-3. A Registration Statement when declared
effective (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will
comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
(and, in the case of any prospectus contained in such Registration Statement,
in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made). As

 



     

 

 



 

soon as practicable following the date that a Registration Statement becomes
effective, but in any event within three Business Days of such date, the
Partnership shall provide the Holders with written notice of the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement. The Partnership shall not be obligated to have
more than one effective Registration Statement at any given time pursuant to
this _Section 2.01_.

 



 

(b) **_Failure to Become Effective_**. If a Registration Statement required by
_Section 2.01(a)_ does not become or is not declared effective by the Target
Effective Date, then each Holder shall be entitled to a payment (with respect
to each of the Holders Registrable Securities which are included in such
Registration Statement), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of (i)
for each non-overlapping 30-day period for the first 60 days following the
Target Effective Date, an amount equal to 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier, and (ii) for each non-overlapping 30-day period beginning on the
61st day following the Target Effective Date, an amount equal to the amount
set forth in clause (i) plus an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages
Multiplier for each subsequent 60 days ( _i.e._ , 0.5% for 61-120 days, 0.75%
for 121-180 days, and 1.0% thereafter), up to a maximum amount equal to 1.0%
of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per non-overlapping 30-day period (the "
** _Liquidated Damages_** "), until such time as such Registration Statement
is declared or becomes effective or there are no longer any Registrable
Securities outstanding. The Liquidated Damages shall be payable within ten
Business Days after the end of each such 30-day period in immediately
available funds to the account or accounts specified by the applicable
Holders. Any amount of Liquidated Damages shall be prorated for any period of
less than 30 days accruing during any period for which a Holder is entitled to
Liquidated Damages hereunder.

 



 

(c) **_Waiver of Liquidated Damages_**. If the Partnership is unable to cause
a Registration Statement to become effective on or before the Target Effective
Date, then the Partnership may request a waiver of the Liquidated Damages,
which may be granted by the consent of the Holders of at least the Registrable
Securities Required Voting Percentage, in their sole discretion, and which
such waiver shall apply to all the Holders of Registrable Securities included
on such Registration Statement.

 



 

(d) **_Delay Rights_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Partnership may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose
Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement, suspend such
Selling Holders use of any prospectus which is a part of such Registration
Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall suspend sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) if (i) the
Partnership is pursuing an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or
other similar transaction and the Partnership determines in good faith that
the Partnerships ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially and adversely affected by any required disclosure of such
transaction in such Registration Statement or (ii) the Partnership or any of
its Affiliates has experienced some other material non-public event, the
disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of the
Partnership, would materially and adversely affect the Partnership; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Selling Holders be suspended from
selling Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement for a
period that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day period or 105 days
in any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination
of the condition described above, the Partnership shall provide prompt notice
to the Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in such
Registration Statement, and shall promptly

 



     

 

 



 

terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such
other actions necessary or appropriate to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this _Section 2.01(d)_ shall apply to any
Underwritten Offering undertaken pursuant to _Section 2.03_.

 



 

 **Section 2.02** **_Piggyback Registration_**.

 



 

(a) **_Participation_**. If at any time the Partnership proposes to file (i) a
Registration Statement (other than a Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_) on behalf of any other Person who has or has been granted
registration rights related to an Underwritten Offering (the " ** _Other
Holder_** "), or (ii) a prospectus supplement relating to the sale of Common
Units by any Other Holders to an effective registration statement, so long as
the Partnership is a WKSI at such time or, whether or not the Partnership is a
WKSI, so long as the Common Unit Registrable Securities were previously
included in the underlying shelf Registration Statement or are included on an
effective Registration Statement, or in any case in which Holders may
participate in such offering without the filing of a post-effective amendment,
in each case, for the sale of Common Units by Other Holders in an Underwritten
Offering, then the Partnership shall give not less than four Business Days
notice (including, but not limited to, notification by electronic mail) (the "
** _Piggyback Notice_** ") of such proposed Underwritten Offering to each
Holder that, together with its Affiliates, owns at least $25 million of Common
Unit Registrable Securities and such Piggyback Notice shall offer such Holder
the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering for Other Holders
such number of Common Unit Registrable Securities (the " ** _Included
Registrable Securities_** ") as such Holder may request in writing (a " **
_Piggyback Registration_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership
shall not be required to offer such opportunity (A) to such Holders if the
Holders, together with their Affiliates, do not offer a minimum of $25 million
of Common Unit Registrable Securities, in the aggregate (determined by
multiplying the number of Common Unit Registrable Securities owned by the
average of the closing price on the National Securities Exchange for the
Common Units for the 10 trading days preceding the date of such notice), or
such lesser amount if it constitutes the remaining holdings of the Holder and
its Affiliates, or (B) to such Holders if and to the extent that the
Partnership has been advised by the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of
Common Unit Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of such Holders
will have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common
Units in such Underwritten Offering, then the amount of Common Unit
Registrable Securities to be offered for the accounts of Holders shall be
determined based on the provisions of _Section 2.02(b)_. Each Piggyback
Notice shall be provided to Holders on a Business Day pursuant to _Section
3.01_ and receipt of such notice shall be confirmed and kept confidential by
the Holders until either (x) such proposed Underwritten Offering has been
publicly announced by the Partnership or (y) the Holders have received notice
from the Partnership that such proposed Underwritten Offering has been
abandoned, which the Partnership shall provide to the Holders reasonably
promptly after the final decision to abandon a proposed Underwritten Offering
has been made. Each such Holder will have four Business Days (or two Business
Days in connection with any overnight or bought Underwritten Offering) after
such Piggyback Notice has been delivered to request in writing to the
Partnership the inclusion of Common Unit Registrable Securities in the
Underwritten Offering for Other Holders. If no request for inclusion from a
Holder is received by the Partnership within the specified time or if a Holder
states in its response to the Piggyback Notice that it declines the
opportunity to include Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering,
such Holder shall have no further right to participate in such Underwritten
Offering. If,

 



     

 

 



 

at any time after giving written notice of the Partnerships intention to
undertake an Underwritten Offering for Other Holders and prior to the pricing
of such Underwritten Offering, such Underwritten Offering is terminated or
delayed pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Partnership may, at
its election, give written notice of such determination to the Selling Holders
and, (1) in the case of a termination of such Underwritten Offering, shall be
relieved of its obligation to sell any Included Registrable Securities in
connection with such terminated Underwritten Offering, and (2) in the case of
a determination to delay such Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to
delay offering any Included Registrable Securities for the same period as the
delay in the Underwritten Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to
withdraw such Selling Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders
Common Unit Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering by giving
written notice to the Partnership of such withdrawal at least one Business Day
prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. Any Holder may
deliver written notice (a " ** _Piggyback Opt-Out Notice_** ") to the
Partnership requesting that such Holder not receive notice from the
Partnership of any proposed Underwritten Offering for Other Holders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Holder may later revoke any such Piggyback
Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following receipt of a Piggyback Opt-Out Notice
from a Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the Partnership shall not be
required to deliver any notice to such Holder pursuant to this _Section
2.02(a)_ and such Holder shall no longer be entitled to participate in
Underwritten Offerings for Other Holders pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_,
unless such Piggyback Opt-Out Notice is revoked by such Holder. The Holders
listed on _Schedule B_ shall each be deemed to have delivered a Piggyback Opt-
Out Notice as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) **_Priority of Piggyback Registration_**. If the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering for Other Holders advise
the Partnership that the total amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities
that Holders intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be
sold in such offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or distribution of the Common Unit Registrable Securities
offered or the market for the Common Units, then the Partnership shall include
the number of Common Units that such Managing Underwriter or Underwriters
advise the Partnership can be sold without having such adverse effect, with
such number to be allocated (i) in the event that the Person that initiated
such Underwritten Offering is the Partnership or ETRN or any of ETRNs
subsidiaries, (A) first, to the Partnership, ETRN or ETRNs subsidiaries, (B)
second, pro rata among any Holders who are Lead Investors and exercising
piggyback registration rights pursuant to this Section 2.02 related to such
offering, (C) third, pro rata among (1) all other Holders who are exercising
piggyback registration rights pursuant to this Section 2.02 related to such
offering and (2) any Persons owning Common Units, having piggyback
registration rights pari passu to those of the Holders described in this
Section 2.02(b)(i)(B) and exercising such piggyback registration rights and
(D) fourth, pro rata among any Persons owning Common Units having piggyback
registration rights subordinate to those of the Holders and exercising such
piggyback registration rights and (ii) in the event that any Person other than
the Partnership or ETRN or any of ETRNs subsidiaries initiated such
Underwritten Offering, (A) first, pro rata among (1) the Person that initiated
such Underwritten Offering and (2) any Holders who are Lead Investors and
exercising piggyback registration rights pursuant to this Section 2.02 related
to such offering, (B) second, pro rata among (1) all other Holders who are
exercising piggyback registration rights pursuant to this Section 2.02 related
to such offering and (2) any Persons owning Common Units, having piggyback
registration rights pari passu to those of the Holders described in this
Section 2.02(b)(ii) and exercising such piggyback registration rights and (C)
third, pro rata among the

 



     

 

 



 

Partnership, ETRN or any of ETRNs subsidiaries (to the extent that such
Person was not the Person initiating the Underwritten Offering on its own
behalf) and Persons owning Common Units, having piggyback registration rights
subordinate to those of the Holders and exercising such piggyback registration
rights (pro rata, as used in this Section 2.02, based, for each such Person or
Holder, as applicable, on the percentage derived by dividing (x) the number of
Common Units proposed to be sold by such Person or Holder, as applicable, in
such offering by (y) the aggregate number of Common Units proposed to be sold
by the Persons sharing in the same tier of pro rata allocation).

 



 

 **Section 2.03** **_Underwritten Offering_**.

 



 

(a) **_S-3 Registration_**. In the event that any of BlackRock, GSO or
Magnetar elects to dispose of Common Unit Registrable Securities under a
Registration Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering and either (i)
reasonably expects gross proceeds of at least $100 million from such
Underwritten Offering (together with any Common Unit Registrable Securities to
be disposed of by a Selling Holder who has elected to participate in such
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02_) or (ii) reasonably expects
gross proceeds of at least $50 million from such Underwritten Offering
(together with any Common Unit Registrable Securities to be disposed of by a
Selling Holder who has elected to participate in such Underwritten Offering
pursuant to _Section 2.02_) and such Common Unit Registrable Securities
represent 100% of the then outstanding Common Unit Registrable Securities held
by the applicable Selling Holder and Affiliates, the Partnership shall, at the
written request of such Selling Holder(s), enter into an underwriting
agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of securities by
the Partnership with the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the
Partnership (subject to the written consent of the Lead Investor initiating
such Underwritten Offering, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
which shall include, among other provisions, indemnities to the effect and to
the extent provided in _Section 2.08_, and shall take all such other
reasonable actions as are requested by the Managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Common
Unit Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership
shall have no obligation to facilitate or participate in, including entering
into any underwriting agreement for more than (i) two Underwritten Offering at
the request of BlackRock, (ii) two Underwritten Offering at the request of GSO
and (iii) two Underwritten Offerings at the request of Magnetar; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that none of the foregoing Underwritten Offerings in clauses (i)
through (iii) above shall occur within 180 days of each other; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Partnership or its Affiliates are conducting or
actively pursuing a securities offering of the Partnerships Common Units with
anticipated gross offering proceeds of at least $100 million (other than in
connection with any at-the-market offering or similar continuous offering
program), then the Partnership may suspend such Selling Holders right to
require the Partnership to conduct an Underwritten Offering on such Selling
Holders behalf pursuant to this _Section 2.03_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Partnership may only suspend such Selling Holders right to require
the Partnership to conduct an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section
_ _2.03_ once in any six-month period and in no event for a period that
exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day period or 105 days in any
365-day period.

 



 

(b) **_General Procedures_**. In connection with any Underwritten Offering
contemplated by _Section 2.03(a)_, the underwriting agreement into which each
Selling Holder and the Partnership shall enter shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 2.08_) and other rights and obligations as are customary in
Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership. No Selling Holder
shall be required to make any representations or warranties to, or agreements
with, the Partnership or the Underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holders authority to enter
into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its ownership of, the
securities being registered on its behalf, its intended method of distribution
and any other representation required by law. If any Selling Holder
disapproves of the terms of an Underwritten Offering contemplated by this
_Section 2.03_, such Selling Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice
to the Partnership and the Managing Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such withdrawal must be made at least one Business Day prior to the time of
pricing of such Underwritten Offering to be effective; _provided_ , _further_
, that in the event the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any proposed
Underwritten Offering advise the Partnership that the total amount of Common
Unit Registrable Securities that Holders intend to include in such offering
exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without being likely to
have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Unit
Registrable Securities offered or the market for the Common Units, and the
amount of Common Unit Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
Underwritten Offering by the Holder that initiated such Underwritten Offering
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (the " ** _Initiating Holder_** ") is reduced
by 50% or more, the Initiating Holder will have the right to withdraw from
such Underwritten Offering by delivering notice to the Partnership at least
one Business Day prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering,
in which case the Partnership will have no obligation to proceed with such
Underwritten Offering and such Underwritten Offering, whether or not
completed, will not decrease the number of Underwritten Offerings the
Initiating Holder shall have the right and option to request under this
_Section 2.03_. No such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the
Partnerships obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 



 

 **Section 2.04** **_Further Obligations_**. In connection with its
obligations under this _Article II_, the Partnership will:

 



 

(a) promptly prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective
for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing
of an Underwritten Offering under a Registration Statement and the Managing
Underwriter at any time shall notify the Partnership in writing that, in the
sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of detailed information
to be used in such prospectus supplement is of material importance to the
success of such Underwritten Offering, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to include such information in such prospectus supplement;

 



 

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information

 



     

 

 



 

pertaining to such Selling Holder and its plan of distribution that is
contained therein and, to the extent timely received, make the corrections
reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information
prior to filing such Registration Statement or such other registration
statement and the prospectus included therein or any supplement or amendment
thereto, and (ii) such number of copies of such Registration Statement or such
other registration statement and the prospectus included therein and any
supplements and amendments thereto as such Persons may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the resale or other disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other registration
statement;

 



 

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by any Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling
Holders or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter,
shall reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership will
not be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject;

 



 

(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same
has become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written comments from the
Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause (i) and any
written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to any such
Registration Statement or any other registration statement or any prospectus
or prospectus supplement thereto;

 



 

(f) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the happening of any event as a result of which the
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in a Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, as then in
effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made);
(ii) the issuance or express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of
any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the
Partnership agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the
prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that
the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the
light of the circumstances then existing and to take such other action

 



     

 

 



 

as is reasonably necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof
or proceedings related thereto;

 



 

(g) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish, or use its reasonable
efforts to cause to be furnished, upon request, (i) an opinion of counsel for
the Partnership addressed to the Underwriters, dated as of the date of the
closing under the applicable underwriting agreement and (ii) a "comfort
letter" addressed to the Underwriters, dated as of the pricing date of such
Underwritten Offering and a letter of like kind dated as of the date of the
closing under the applicable underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by
the independent public accountants who have certified the Partnerships
financial statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "comfort letter" shall
be in customary form and covering substantially the same matters with respect
to such registration statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus
supplement) as have been customarily covered in opinions of issuers counsel
and in accountants letters delivered to the underwriters in Underwritten
Offerings of securities by the Partnership and such other matters as such
Underwriters may reasonably request;

 



 

(i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission;

 



 

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter during normal business hours access to such information and
Partnership personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to
establish a due diligence defense under the Securities Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership need not disclose any non-public information
to any such representative unless and until such representative has entered
into a confidentiality agreement with the Partnership;

 



 

(k) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Common Unit
Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement to be listed on
each securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation system on which
similar securities issued by the Partnership are then listed; _provided,
however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall have no
obligation to cause any Series A Preferred Unit Registrable Securities
registered pursuant to this Agreement to be listed on any National Securities
Exchange or nationally recognized quotation system;

 



 

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Registrable Securities to
be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities;

 



     

 

 



 

(m) provide a transfer agent, which may be the General Partner or one of its
Affiliates as provided in the Partnership Agreement, and registrar for all
Registrable Securities covered by any Registration Statement not later than
the Effective Date of such Registration Statement;

 



 

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the Underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of Common Unit Registrable
Securities (including making appropriate officers of the General Partner
available to participate in customary marketing activities); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the officers of the General Partner shall not be required to
dedicate an unreasonably burdensome amount of time in connection with any
roadshow and related marketing activities for any Underwritten Offering;

 



 

(o) if reasonably requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such
Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included therein relating to the sale
and distribution of Registrable Securities, including information with respect
to the number of Registrable Securities being offered or sold, the purchase
price being paid therefor and any other terms of the offering of the
Registrable Securities to be sold in such offering; and (ii) make all required
filings of such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment after being
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment;

 



 

(p) if reasonably required by the Partnerships transfer agent, promptly
deliver any authorizations, certificates and directions required by the
transfer agent which authorize and direct the transfer agent to transfer such
Registrable Securities without legend upon sale by the Holder of such
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement; and

 



 

(q) if any Holder could reasonably be deemed to be an "underwriter," as
defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with the
Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereof (a " ** _Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement_** "), then reasonably cooperate with such
Holder in allowing such Holder to conduct customary "underwriters due
diligence" with respect to the Partnership and satisfy its obligations in
respect thereof. In addition, at any Holders request, the Partnership will
furnish to such Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of the Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement and thereafter from time to time on such
dates as such Holder may reasonably request (provided that such request shall
not be more frequently than on an annual basis unless such Holder is offering
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Holder Underwriter Registration
Statement), (i) a "comfort letter", dated as of such date, from the
Partnerships independent certified public accountants in form and substance
as has been customarily given by independent certified public accountants to
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership,
addressed to such Holder, (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel
representing the Partnership for purposes of the Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as has been customarily
given in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership, including
standard "10b-5" negative assurance for such offerings, addressed to such
Holder and (iii) a standard officers certificate from the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer, or other officers serving such functions,
of the General Partner addressed to the Holder, as has been customarily given
by such officers in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership.
The Partnership will also use

 



     

 

 



 

its reasonable efforts to provide legal counsel to such Holder with an
opportunity to review and comment upon any such Holder Underwriter
Registration Statement, and any amendments and supplements thereto, prior to
its filing with the Commission.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.04_, the
Partnership will not name a Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section
2(a)(11) of the Securities Act) in any Registration Statement or Holder
Underwriter Registration Statement, as applicable, without such Holders
consent. If the staff of the Commission requires the Partnership to name any
Holder as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities
Act), and such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders Registrable
Securities shall not be included on the applicable Registration Statement, and
the Partnership shall have no further obligations hereunder with respect to
Registrable Securities held by such Holder, unless such Holder has not had an
opportunity to conduct customary underwriters due diligence as set forth in
_subsection (q)_ of this _Section 2.04_ with respect to the Partnership at
the time such Holders consent is sought.

 



 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening of any event of the kind described in _subsection (f)_ of this
_Section 2.04_, shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until
such Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by _subsection (f)_ of this _Section 2.04_ or until
it is advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may
be resumed and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus, and, if so directed by the
Partnership, such Selling Holder will, or will request the Managing
Underwriter or Managing Underwriters, if any, to deliver to the Partnership
(at the Partnerships expense) all copies in their possession or control,
other than permanent file copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of
the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice.

 



 

 **Section 2.05** **_Cooperation by Holders_**. The Partnership shall have no
obligation to include Registrable Securities of a Holder in a Registration
Statement or in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ if
such Holder has failed to timely furnish such information that the Partnership
determines, after consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in
order for any registration statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable,
to comply with the Securities Act.

 



 

 **Section 2.06** **_Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_**. Each Holder of Common Unit Registrable Securities who is
participating in an Underwritten Offering agrees to enter into a customary
letter agreement with Underwriters providing that such Holder will not effect
any public sale or distribution of Common Unit Registrable Securities during
the 45 calendar day period beginning on the date of a prospectus or prospectus
supplement filed with the Commission with respect to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer
than the duration of the shortest restriction imposed by the Underwriters on
the Partnership or the officers, directors or any other Affiliate of the
Partnership on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 2.06_ shall not apply to any Common Unit Registrable
Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such Holder.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 2.07** **_Expenses_**.

 



 

(a) **_Certain Definitions_**. " ** _Registration Expenses_** " shall not
include Selling Expenses but otherwise means all expenses incident to the
Partnerships performance under or compliance with this Agreement to effect
the registration of Registrable Securities on a Registration Statement
pursuant to _Section 2.01_, a Piggyback Registration pursuant to _Section
2.02_, or an Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03_, and the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including all registration,
filing, securities exchange listing and National Securities Exchange fees, all
registration, filing, qualification and other fees and expenses of complying
with securities or blue sky laws, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, fees of transfer agents and registrars, all word processing,
duplicating and printing expenses, and the fees and disbursements of counsel
and independent public accountants for the Partnership, including the expenses
of any special audits or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to
such performance and compliance. " ** _Selling Expenses_** " means all
underwriting fees, discounts and selling commissions and transfer taxes
allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities, plus any costs or
expenses related to any roadshows conducted in connection with the marketing
of any Underwritten Offering.

 



 

(b) **_Expenses_**. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration
Expenses, as determined in good faith, in connection with a shelf
Registration, a Piggyback Registration or an Underwritten Offering, whether or
not any sale is made pursuant to such shelf Registration, Piggyback
Registration or Underwritten Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro
rata share of all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its
Registrable Securities hereunder. In addition, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 2.08_, the Partnership shall not be responsible for professional
fees (including legal fees) incurred by Holders in connection with the
exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 2.08** **_Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) **_By the Partnership_**. In the event of a registration of any
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement,
the Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder
thereunder, its directors, officers, managers, partners, employees and agents
and each Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers,
managers, partners, employees or agents (collectively, the " ** _Selling
Holder Indemnified Persons_** "), against any losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
(collectively, " ** _Losses_** "), joint or several, to which such Selling
Holder Indemnified Person may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact (in
the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which such
statement is made) contained in (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes
documents incorporated by reference in) the applicable Registration Statement
or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, any
preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or any free writing
prospectus relating thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified Person for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in

 



     

 

 



 

connection with investigating, defending or resolving any such Loss or actions
or proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership will not be liable
in any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in the
applicable Registration Statement or other registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus, or amendment or
supplement thereto, or any free writing prospectus relating thereto, as
applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder Indemnified
Person, and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling
Holder.

 



 

(b) **_By Each Selling Holder_**. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner
and the General Partners directors, officers, employees and agents and each
Person, who, directly or indirectly, controls the Partnership within the
meaning of the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only with
respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing by
or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in a Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement,
any preliminary prospectus, prospectus supplement or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any free writing
prospectus relating thereto; _provided, however_ , that the liability of each
Selling Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
proceeds (net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

 



 

(c) **_Notice_**. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section
2.08(c),_ except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced by such failure. In any action brought against any indemnified
party, it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and
undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this _Section 2.08_ for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with
counsel so selected; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying
party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in any such
action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and
counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses

 



     

 

 



 

related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnifying party shall settle any action brought against any indemnified
party with respect to which such indemnified party may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the consent of the indemnified party, unless
the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, includes a
complete and unconditional release from liability of, and does not contain any
admission of wrongdoing by, the indemnified party.

 



 

(d) **_Contribution_**. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.08_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any Selling Holder be required to contribute an
aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling
Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other
hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to,
information supplied by such party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to be determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by
an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include any legal and other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating, defending or resolving any Loss that is the subject of this
paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 



 

(e) **_Other Indemnification_**. The provisions of this _Section 2.08_ shall
be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 



 

 **Section 2.09** **_Rule 144 Reporting_**. With a view to making available
the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may
permit the resale of the Registrable Securities without registration, the
Partnership agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Partnership available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act
(or any similar provision then in effect), at all times from and after the
date hereof;

 



      

 

 



 

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Partnership under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act at all times from and after the date hereof; and

 



 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the
Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
under the Securities Act (or any similar provision then in effect) and (ii)
unless otherwise available via the Commissions EDGAR filing system, to such
Holder forthwith upon request a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of the Partnership, and such other reports and documents so filed as
such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or
regulation of the Commission allowing such Holder to sell any such securities
without registration.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** **_Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_**. The
rights to cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities under this
_Article II_ may be transferred or assigned by each Holder to one or more
transferees or assignees of Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) unless any such transferee or assignee is an Affiliate of, and after
such transfer or assignment continues to be an Affiliate of, such Holder, the
amount of Registrable Securities transferred or assigned to such transferee or
assignee shall represent at least $50 million of Registrable Securities,
calculated on the basis of the Purchased Unit Price or such lesser amount if
it constitutes the remaining holdings of the Holder and its Affiliates, (b)
the Partnership is given written notice prior to any said transfer or
assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee or assignee
and identifying the securities with respect to which such registration rights
are being transferred or assigned and (c) each such transferee or assignee
assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of the obligations of such
transferring Holder under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.11** **_Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_**. From
and after the date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Holders of at least the Registrable Securities Required
Voting Percentage, enter into any agreement with any current or future holder
of any securities of the Partnership that would allow such current or future
holder to require the Partnership to include securities in any registration
statement filed by the Partnership for Other Holders on a basis other than
_pari passu_ with, or expressly subordinate to, the piggyback rights of the
Holders of Common Unit Registrable Securities hereunder; _provided_ , that in
no event shall the Partnership enter into any agreement that would permit
another holder of securities of the Partnership to participate on a superior
or _pari passu_ basis (in terms of priority of cut-back based on advice of
Underwriters) with a Holder requesting registration or takedown in an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_.

 



 

 **Section 2.12** **_Limitation on Obligations for Series A Preferred Unit
Registrable Securities_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
Partnership to (a) conduct an underwritten offering for the public sale,
resale or any other disposition of Series A Preferred Unit Registrable
Securities, (b) except as expressly provided in this Agreement, otherwise
assist in the public resale of any Series A Preferred Unit Registrable
Securities, (c) provide any Holder of Series A Preferred Unit Registrable
Securities any rights to include any Series A Preferred Unit Registrable
Securities in any underwritten offering relating to the sale by the
Partnership or any other Person of any

 



     

 

 



 

securities of the Partnership or (d) cause any Series A Preferred Unit
Registrable Securities to be listed on any securities exchange or nationally
recognized quotation system.

 



 

 **Section 2.13** **_Obligation to Obtain Rating for Series A Preferred
Units_**. If requested by any of the Lead Investors, the Partnership shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a rating from a
nationally recognized rating agency (chosen by such Holders) with respect to
the Series A Preferred Units until the date on which all Series A Preferred
Units have been converted into Common Units. The Partnership shall be entitled
to reimbursement from the Holders holding Series A Preferred Units for all
direct costs paid to the applicable rating agency by the Partnership in
obtaining the initial rating, which costs shall be shared by such Holders pro
rata (based, for each such Holder on the percentage derived by dividing (x)
the number of Series A Preferred Units held by each such Holder, by (y) the
aggregate number of Series A Preferred Units outstanding at the time such
rating is obtained). After the date on which a rating has been obtained for
the Series A Preferred Units, if requested by the Holders of 75% of the Series
A Preferred Units then outstanding, the Partnership shall use commercially
reasonably efforts to cause such rating on the Series A Preferred Units to be
withdrawn.

subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities to the extent permitted herein.
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not be

of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party.

 



 

 **Section 3.04** **_Recapitalization, Exchanges, Etc. Affecting Units_**.
The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth

consolidation, reorganization, sale of assets or otherwise) that may be issued

of this Agreement by a party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible, to

and without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the
right to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, and each of the parties hereto hereby waives
any and all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of

Person from pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in equity that
such Person may have.

 



 

 **Section 3.07** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered,

or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), will be construed
in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action against any party
relating to the foregoing shall be brought in any federal or state court of

inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO,
IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
AGREE AND CONSENT THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL
BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH

means of a written amendment signed by the Partnership and the Holders of at
least the Registrable Securities Required Voting Percentage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such amendment shall adversely affect the rights of any
Holder hereunder without the consent of such Holder. Any amendment, supplement
or modification of or to any provision of this Agreement, any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, and any consent to any departure by the
Partnership or any Holder from the terms of any provision of this Agreement

the parties hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that, other than as set
forth herein, no Person other than the Purchasers, the Holders, their
respective permitted assignees and the Partnership shall have any obligation

Affiliate of any of such Persons or their respective permitted assignees, or
any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any applicable law, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to,
be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any former, current or future
director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,

 **Section 3.14** **_Interpretation_**. Article, Section and Schedule
references in this Agreement are references to the corresponding Article,
Section or Schedule to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified. All
Schedules to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as
if set forth in full herein and are an integral part of this Agreement. All
references to instruments, documents, contracts and agreements are references
to such instruments, documents, contracts and agreements as the same may be
amended, supplemented and otherwise modified from time to time, unless
otherwise specified. The word "including" shall mean "including but not
limited to" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it.

under this Agreement, the expense of complying with that obligation shall be
an expense of the Partnership unless otherwise specified. Any reference in
this Agreement to "$" shall mean U.S. dollars. Whenever any determination,
consent or approval is to be made or given by a Purchaser, such action shall
be in such Holders sole discretion, unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement. If any provision in this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid,
not binding or unenforceable, (a) such provision shall be fully severable and
this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid,
not binding or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this
Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect,
and (b) the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the
period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any words
imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice versa.
The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof" and "hereunder" refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words
appear unless the context otherwise requires. The provision of a Table of
Contents, the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this
Agreement.

The Partnership is a limited partnership under the DRULPA, with limited partnership power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business in all material respects as described in the SEC Reports. With your consent, based solely on certificates from public officials, we confirm that the Partnership is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

With your consent, based solely on certificates from public officials, we confirm that each of the Material Subsidiaries is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation.

 



 

4. The Series A Preferred Units to be issued and sold to the Purchasers by the Partnership pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the limited partner interests represented thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership action of the Partnership and, when issued and delivered to the Purchasers against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued and free of preemptive rights arising from the Partnership Governing Documents as currently in effect, except as have been waived. Under the DRULPA, Purchasers will have no obligation to make further payments for their purchase of the Series A Preferred Units or contributions to the Partnership, solely by reason of their ownership of the Series A Preferred Units or their status as a limited partner of the Partnership, and no personal liability for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a limited partner of the Partnership.

 



 

5.

Conversion Units or their status as a limited partner of the Partnership and
no personal liability for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the

of being a limited partner of the Partnership.

 



 

6. The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement, the Amended Partnership Agreement, and the Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the "Operative Documents") by the Partnership or the General Partner, as applicable, have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership action of the Partnership and limited liability company action of the General Partner, and each of the Operative Documents has been duly executed and delivered by the Partnership or the General Partner, as applicable.

 



 

7. The execution and delivery by the Partnership and the General Partner, as applicable, of the Operative Documents and the issuance and sale by the Partnership of the Series A Preferred Units to you do not on the date hereof:

 



 

(i) violate the provisions of the Governing Documents;

 



 

(ii) result in the breach of or a default under any of the Specified
Agreements;

 



 

(iii) violate any federal, New York statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Partnership or the Delaware Laws; or

 



 

(iv) require any consents, approvals, or authorizations to be obtained by the
Partnership or the General Partner from, or any registrations, declarations or
filings to be made by the Partnership or the General Partner with, any
governmental authority under any federal, New York statute, rule or regulation
applicable to the Partnership or the General Partner or the Delaware Laws on
or prior to the date hereof that have not been obtained or made.

 



 

8. The Partnership is not, and immediately after giving effect to the issuance and sale of the Series A Preferred Units in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and after giving effect to the use of proceeds from the sale of the Series A Preferred Units to partially fund the transactions contemplated by the Eureka Purchase Agreement, will not be required to be, registered as an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 



 

9. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Purchasers and the Partnership contained in the Purchase Agreement, the offer, issuance and sale of the Series A Preferred Units by the Partnership to the Purchasers solely in the manner contemplated

     

 

 



 

by the Purchase Agreement, are exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. We express no opinion, however, as to when or under what
circumstances the Purchasers may reoffer or resell any Series A Preferred
Units.

 



 

10. Except as otherwise described in the Partnership Agreement or the Operative Documents, there are no restrictions upon the voting or transfer of any Series A Preferred Units or Conversion Units pursuant to the Partnership Governing Documents or any Specified Agreement.
