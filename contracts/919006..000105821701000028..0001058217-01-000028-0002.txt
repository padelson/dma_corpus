outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time,  other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled  pursuant to SECTION 1.6(c) hereof,  will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to SECTION 1.6(f)
and SECTION  1.6(g)  hereof)  into the right to receive,  upon  surrender of the
certificate  representing  such  share of  Company  Common  Stock in the  manner
provided  in SECTION 1.7 hereof (or in the case of a lost,  stolen or  destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner
provided in SECTION 1.9  hereof),  that number (the  "EXCHANGE  RATIO") of fully
paid and  nonassessable  shares of Common Stock,  par value $0.001 per share, of
Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK"), equal to

         A divide by (B+C)

         Where:  A =  2,960,000;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  in the  event  all of the
                 outstanding  shares of Series B Preferred  Stock (as defined in
                 SECTION 1.6(b)) are not converted into shares of Company Common
                 Stock at or prior to the Effective Time, and the holders of any
                 shares  of  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  elect to  receive  the
                 Preferred  Cash  Consideration  (as  defined in SECTION  1.6(b)
                 hereof) in exchange for each shares of Series B Preferred Stock
                 in accordance with the Company's  Certificate of Designation of
                 Series B Preferred Stock and pursuant to SECTION 1.6(b) hereof,

                 multiplied  by (B) the  number of shares of Series B  Preferred
                 Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time,

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                 divided by (C) the average closing price of one share of Parent
                 Common  Stock for the five (5) most  recent  days  that  Parent
                 Common Stock has traded  ending on the trading day  immediately
                 prior to the Effective  Time, as reported on the New York Stock
                 Exchange  ("NYSE")  Composite  Transaction  Tape (the  "Average
                 Trading Price").

                 B = the number of shares of Company  Common  Stock  outstanding
                 immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  (including  (i) the
                 number  of shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  issued  upon the
                 conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred  Stock converted
                 at or prior to the  Effective  Time,  and  (ii) any  shares  of
                 Company  Common  Stock issued upon the exercise of all purchase
                 rights  outstanding  under the ESPP pursuant to SECTION  5.8(b)
                 hereof)  other than those shares of Company  Common Stock to be
                 canceled pursuant to SECTION 1.6(c) hereof; and

                 C = the number of shares of Company  Common Stock issuable upon
                 the  exercise of Company  Stock  Options (as defined in SECTION
                 1.6(d) hereof)  outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective
                 Time (whether vested or unvested)  (including  those options to
                 purchase shares of Company Common Stock which are granted after
                 the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time).

         For purposes of clarity, assuming (i) that as of the date hereof, there
are  1,626,277  shares of Company  Common  Stock  issuable  upon the exercise of
Company  Stock  Options  outstanding  on the  date  hereof  (whether  vested  or
unvested),  (ii) that no additional  Company Stock Options are granted after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective  Time, and (iii) that the Average Trading
Price equals $40.74 (i.e.,  the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the date
hereof),  (A) in the event  that the all of the  outstanding  shares of Series B
Preferred  Stock were  converted into shares of Company Common Stock at or prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio derived from the foregoing formula set
forth in this SECTION  1.6(a) will be 0.536,  and (B) in the event that the none
of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into shares
of Company  Common Stock at or prior to the Effective  Time,  the Exchange Ratio
derived  from the  foregoing  formula set forth in this  SECTION  1.6(a) will be
0.578.

         If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase  option,  risk of
forfeiture or other  condition  under any applicable  restricted  stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with the Company,  then the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange  for such shares of Company  Common Stock shall also be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase option,  risk of forfeiture or other
condition, and the certificates  representing such shares of Parent Common Stock
may accordingly be marked with appropriate  legends.  The Company shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that,  from and after the Effective Time,
Parent is  entitled to exercise  any such  repurchase  option or other right set
forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

         (b)  CONVERSION  OF SERIES B  PREFERRED  STOCK.  Each share of Series B
Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  par value $0.01 per share,  of the Company  (the
"Series B Preferred  Stock")  issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and  extinguished and  automatically  converted
(subject to SECTION 1.6(f) and SECTION 1.6(g) hereof) into the right to receive,
upon surrender of the certificate  representing such share of Series B Preferred
Stock in the manner  provided  in SECTION  1.7 hereof (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed  certificate,  upon  delivery of an affidavit  (and bond, if
required) in the manner  provided in SECTION 1.9 hereof) $80.00 (the  "PREFERRED
CASH CONSIDERATION")  payable (without interest) in U.S. currency in immediately
available funds to the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

         (c)  CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED  STOCK.  Each share of Company Common
Stock  held by the  Company  or owned by Merger  Sub,  Parent  or any  direct or
indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to
the Effective  Time shall be canceled and  extinguished  without any  conversion
thereof.

         (d) STOCK  OPTIONS;  EMPLOYEE STOCK  PURCHASE  PLANS.  At the Effective
Time,  all options to purchase  Company  Common  Stock (each,  a "COMPANY  STOCK

the Company's 2000 Stock  Incentive  Plan, 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, 1994 Stock
Option Plan and 1994 Formula  Stock Option Plan (each,  a "COMPANY  OPTION PLAN"
and  collectively,  the "COMPANY  OPTION  PLANS")  shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance  with  SECTION  5.8 hereof.  Purchase  rights  outstanding  under the
Company's  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (the "ESPP")  shall be treated as set
forth in SECTION 5.8 hereof.

         (e) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of Common Stock,  par value
$0.001  per share,  of Merger Sub (the  "MERGER  SUB COMMON  STOCK")  issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable  share of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share,  of the Surviving  Corporation.  Each  certificate  evidencing
ownership  of  shares  of  Merger  Sub  Common  Stock  immediately  prior to the
Effective Time shall  evidence  ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

         (f) ADJUSTMENTS TO EXCHANGE RATIO. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect  appropriately  the effect of any stock split,  reverse  stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization,  recapitalization,  reclassification,  combination,  exchange of
shares or other  like  change  with  respect to Parent  Common  Stock or Company

Time.

         (g)  FRACTIONAL  SHARES.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock

shares of Company Common Stock who would  otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of Parent  Common  Stock (after  aggregating  all  fractional  shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon
surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in SECTION 1.7(c) hereof)

                                      -5-

         (a)  EXCHANGE  AGENT.  Parent  shall  select  a bank or  trust  company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE

         (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
make  available to the Exchange  Agent,  for  exchange in  accordance  with this
ARTICLE I, the shares of Parent  Common Stock  issuable  pursuant to SECTION 1.6
hereof in exchange for outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock,  and cash in
an amount  sufficient for (i) payment in lieu of fractional  shares  pursuant to

hereof.

         (c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  Promptly after the Effective Time, (and in no
event more than ten (10)  business days  following  the  Effective  Time) Parent
shall  cause the  Exchange  Agent to mail to each  holder  of record  (as of the
Effective Time) of a certificate or  certificates  (the  "CERTIFICATES"),  which
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  represented  outstanding  shares  of
Company  Common Stock or Series B Preferred  Stock which were converted into the
right to receive  shares of Parent Common Stock  pursuant to SECTION 1.6 hereof,
cash in lieu of any fractional  shares pursuant to SECTION 1.6(g) hereof and any
dividends or other distributions  pursuant to SECTION 1.7(d) hereof or Preferred
Cash Consideration, as applicable, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the  Certificates  shall pass, only upon delivery of the  Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other  provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify)  and  (ii)  instructions  for use in  effecting  the  surrender  of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates  representing  shares of Parent Common
Stock,  cash in lieu of any fractional  shares pursuant to SECTION 1.6(g) hereof
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to SECTION 1.7(d) or Preferred
Cash   Consideration,   as  applicable.   Upon  surrender  of  Certificates  for
cancellation  to the  Exchange  Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent,  together with such letter of  transmittal,  duly completed
and validly  executed  in  accordance  with the  instructions  thereto,  (i) the
holders of such  Certificates  formerly  representing  shares of Company  Common
Stock  shall  be  entitled   to  receive  in  exchange   therefor   certificates
representing  the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their
shares of Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time (as adjusted
for any stock splits,  reverse stock  splits,  stock  dividends or the like with
respect  to the  shares of Parent  Common  Stock  with a record  date  after the
Effective  Time),  payment in lieu of fractional  shares which such holders have
the right to receive  pursuant to SECTION  1.6(g)  hereof and any  dividends  or
distributions payable pursuant to SECTION 1.7(d) hereof, and (ii) the holders of
such Certificates formerly representing shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Preferred Cash Consideration for
each share of Series B Preferred  Stock,  and the  Certificates  so  surrendered
shall  forthwith be canceled.  Until so  surrendered,  outstanding  Certificates
shall be deemed from and after the Effective  Time, for all corporate  purposes,

                                      -6-

subject to SECTION  1.7(d)  hereof as to dividends and other  distributions,  to
evidence  only the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock
into which such shares of Company  Common Stock shall have been so converted and
the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares  in  accordance   with  SECTION   1.6(g)  hereof  and  any  dividends  or
distributions  payable pursuant to SECTION 1.7(d) hereof or the right to receive
Preferred Cash Consideration, as applicable.

         (d) DISTRIBUTIONS  WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED  SHARES. No dividends or
other  distributions  declared  or made  after the date of this  Agreement  with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective  Time will
be paid to the holders of any  unsurrendered  Certificates  with  respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of
such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates.  Subject to applicable law,
promptly following surrender of any such Certificates,  the Exchange Agent shall
deliver  to  the  record  holders  thereof,   without   interest,   certificates
representing  whole shares of Parent  Common  Stock issued in exchange  therefor
along with  payment in lieu of  fractional  shares  pursuant  to SECTION  1.6(g)
hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the  Effective  Time  payable  with  respect to such whole  shares of
Parent Common Stock.

         (e)  TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP.  If  certificates  representing  shares of
Parent  Common  Stock are to be issued  in a name  other  than that in which the
Certificates  surrendered  in exchange  therefor  are  registered,  it will be a
condition of the issuance  thereof that the  Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent  designated by it
any transfer or other taxes  required by reason of the issuance of  certificates
representing  shares of Parent  Common  Stock in any name other than that of the
registered  holder  of  the  Certificates  surrendered,  or  established  to the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid
or is not payable.

         (f) REQUIRED  WITHHOLDING.  Each of the Exchange Agent,  Parent and the
Surviving  Corporation  shall  be  entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company  Common Stock such amounts as may be required
(as advised by tax  counsel  for  Parent) to be  deducted or withheld  therefrom
under the Code or under any  provision  of state,  local or  foreign  tax law or
under any other applicable legal requirement.  To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld,  such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

         (g) NO  LIABILITY.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in this
SECTION 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent,  Parent, the Surviving  Corporation nor
any other party  hereto  shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent  Common
Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount  properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

PREFERRED STOCK. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the
terms hereof  (including  any cash paid in respect  thereof  pursuant to SECTION
1.6(g) and SECTION  1.7(d)  hereof)  shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction  of all rights  pertaining to such shares of Company  Common Stock,
and the Preferred Cash  Consideration  issued in accordance  with SECTION 1.6(b)
hereof  shall be deemed to have been issued in full  satisfaction  of all rights
pertaining to shares of Series B Preferred  Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving  Corporation of shares
of Company  Common  Stock or Series B  Preferred  Stock  which were  outstanding
immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time.  If,  after  the  Effective  Time,
Certificates  are presented to the Surviving  Corporation  for any reason,  they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I.

     1.9  LOST,  STOLEN  OR  DESTROYED  CERTIFICATES.  In  the  event  that  any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange  for such lost,  stolen or  destroyed  Certificates,  upon the
making  of an  affidavit  of  that  fact  by the  holder  thereof,  certificates
representing  the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to SECTION
1.6 hereof,  cash for fractional  shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
SECTION  1.6(g) hereof and any dividends or  distributions  payable  pursuant to
SECTION 1.7(d) hereof or Preferred Cash Consideration, as applicable;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of such certificates  representing  shares of Parent Common Stock, cash
and other  distributions,  or  Preferred  Stock  Consideration,  as  applicable,

are specifically  disclosed in writing in the disclosure  letter supplied by the
Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof and certified by a duly authorized
officer of the Company (the "COMPANY SCHEDULE"),  which disclosure shall provide
an exception to or otherwise  qualify the  representations  or warranties of the
Company  specifically  referred  to in  the  Company  Schedule  and  such  other
representations  and warranties to the extent such disclosure  shall  reasonably
appear to be applicable to such other representations or warranties, as follows:

     2.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) Each of the  Company and its  subsidiaries  is a  corporation  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the
jurisdiction  of its  incorporation  and has the requisite  corporate  power and
authority to own,  lease and operate its assets and  properties  and to carry on
its  business as it is now being  conducted,  except  where the failure to do so
would not, individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in SECTION  8.3  hereof) on the  Company.  Each of the  Company  and its
subsidiaries  is  in  possession  of  all  franchises,  grants,  authorizations,
licenses,  permits,  easements,  consents,  certificates,  approvals  and orders
("APPROVALS")  necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to
own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such Approvals  would not,  individually  or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

         (b)  The  Company  has no  subsidiaries  except  for  the  corporations
identified in SECTION  2.1(b) of the Company  Schedule.  Neither the Company nor
any of its  subsidiaries has agreed nor is obligated to make nor is bound by any
written,  oral  or  other  agreement,  contract,   subcontract,  lease,  binding
understanding,  instrument,  note, option,  warranty,  purchase order,  license,
sublicense,  insurance  policy,  benefit plan,  commitment or undertaking of any
nature,  as of the date hereof or as may  hereafter be in effect (a  "CONTRACT")
under which it may become obligated to make, any future investment in or capital
contribution  to any other entity.  Except as set forth in SECTION 2.1(b) of the
Company  Schedule,  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries  directly or
indirectly  owns any equity or similar  interest in or any interest  convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture  or other  business,  association  or
entity.

         (c)  The  Company  and  each of its  subsidiaries  is  qualified  to do
business as a foreign  corporation,  and is in good standing,  under the laws of
all jurisdictions where the nature of their business requires such qualification
and where the  failure  to be so  qualified  or in good  standing  would  have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     2.2  CERTIFICATE OF  INCORPORATION  AND BYLAWS.  The Company has previously
furnished  to  Parent  a  complete  and  correct  copy  of  its  Certificate  of
Incorporation  and Bylaws as amended to date  (together,  the  "COMPANY  CHARTER

Company is not in  violation  of any of the  provisions  of the Company  Charter
Documents,  and no subsidiary  of the Company is in violation of its  equivalent
organizational documents.

     2.3 CAPITALIZATION.

         (a) The authorized  capital stock of the Company consists of 50,000,000

corporate  power and  authority  to execute and deliver  this  Agreement  and to
perform its obligations  hereunder and, subject to obtaining the approval of the
stockholders  of the  Company of the  Merger,  to  consummate  the  transactions

their respective  properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach
of or  constitute  a default  (or an event that with  notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or materially impair the Company's or any of
its  subsidiaries'  rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third party
under, or give to others any rights of termination,  amendment,  acceleration or
cancellation  of, or result in the creation of a lien or  encumbrance  on any of

aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to have a Material  Adverse  Effect on the
Company or, after the Effective  Time,  Parent,  or prevent  consummation of the
Merger or otherwise prevent the parties hereto from performing their obligations

material benefit or incur any material liability.  No investigation or review by
any governmental or regulatory body or authority is pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries,  nor has any
governmental  or  regulatory  body or  authority  indicated  to the  Company  an
intention to conduct the same,  other than, in each such case, those the outcome
of which could not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to
have the effect of prohibiting or materially any material  business  practice of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries,  any acquisition of material property by
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the conduct of business by the Company
or any of its  subsidiaries  in  substantially  the  same  manner  as  currently
conducted.

         (b) The  Company  and its  subsidiaries  hold  all  permits,  licenses,
variances,  exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental authorities which
are material to  operation  of the business of the Company and its  subsidiaries
taken as a whole  (each,  a "COMPANY  PERMIT"  and  collectively,  the  "COMPANY
PERMITS").  The Company and its  subsidiaries  are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of each of the Company Permits.

a filing  prior to the date of this  Agreement  then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading.  None of the Company's  subsidiaries is required to file any reports
or other documents with the SEC.

         (b) Each set of consolidated financial statements  (including,  in each
case,  any related notes  thereto)  contained in the Company SEC Reports and the

                                      -13-

set of financial statements set forth on SECTION 2.7 of the Company Schedule for
the period ended  December 23, 2000,  was prepared in accordance  with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q

consolidated  financial  position  of the Company  and its  subsidiaries  at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash
flows for the periods  indicated,  except that the unaudited  interim  financial
statements were or are subject to normal  adjustments  which were not or are not
expected to be material in amount.

         (c) The  Company  has  previously  furnished  to Parent a complete  and
correct copy of any amendments or  modifications,  which have not yet been filed
with the SEC but which are  required to be filed,  to  agreements,  documents or
other  instruments  which  previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC

pursuant to that  certain  Asset  Purchase  Agreement,  dated as of December 29,

         (b) Each Plan has been  maintained  and  administered  in all  material
respects in compliance  with its terms and with the  requirements  prescribed by
any and all statutes,  orders, rules and regulations,  including but not limited

other litigation  (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of Plan  activities)  has been  brought,  or to the  knowledge of the Company is
threatened,  against  or with  respect  to any such  Plan.  There are no audits,
inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
by the IRS or DOL with  respect to any Plans.  All  contributions,  reserves  or
premium  payments  required  to be made or accrued as of the date  hereof to the
Plans have been timely made or accrued.  Any Plan intended to be qualified under
Section  401(a) of the Code and each trust  intended  to qualify  under  Section
501(a)  of  the  Code  (i)  has  either  obtained  a  favorable   determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified
status  from the IRS or still has a  remaining  period of time under  applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and
to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable  determination,  and (ii)
incorporates  or has been  amended to  incorporate  all  provisions  required to
comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent  legislation to the extent
such amendment or  incorporation is required as of the Closing Date. The Company
does not have any plan or  commitment  to establish  any new Plan, to modify any
Plan  (except to the extent  required  by law or to conform any such Plan to the
requirements  of any  applicable  law, in each case as  previously  disclosed to
Parent in writing,  or as required by this Agreement),  or to enter into any new
Plan. Each Plan can be amended,  terminated or otherwise  discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms,  without  liability to Parent,  the
Company or any of its Affiliates  (other than ordinary  administration  expenses
and expenses for benefits accrued but not yet paid).

         (c)  Neither the  Company,  any of its  subsidiaries,  nor any of their
Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, or  contributed  to any plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code and at no time has the Company or any of its  subsidiaries  contributed
to or been requested to contribute to any "multiemployer  plan," as such term is
defined in ERISA or to any plan described in Section 413(c) of the Code. Neither
the Company, any of its subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is subject to any material liability or penalty under
Section  4975  through  4980B of the Code or Title I of  ERISA.  No  "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and

                                      -16-

with respect to any Plan which could subject the Company or its  subsidiaries to
material liabilities.

         (d)  Neither the  Company,  any of its  subsidiaries,  nor any of their
Affiliates  has,  prior  to the  Effective  Time  and in any  material  respect,
violated any of the health continuation  requirements of COBRA, the requirements
of the Family  Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended,  the  requirements  of the
Women's  Health and Cancer  Rights  Act,  as amended,  the  requirements  of the
Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996, as amended, or any similar
provisions  of state law  applicable  to  employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.  None of the Plans promises or provides  retiree  medical or other
retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable law, and
neither the Company nor any of its  subsidiaries  has  represented,  promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits to
any employee, former employee,  director,  consultant or other person, except to
the extent required by statute.

         (e)  Neither the  Company  nor any of its  subsidiaries  is bound by or
subject  to (and  none of its  respective  assets or  properties  is bound by or
subject to) any arrangement  with any labor union. No employee of the Company or
any of its  subsidiaries  is  represented  by any labor  union or covered by any
collective  bargaining  agreement  and,  to the  knowledge  of the  Company,  no
campaign to establish such  representation  is in progress.  There is no pending
or, to the  knowledge of the Company,  threatened  labor  dispute  involving the
Company or any of its  subsidiaries  and any group of its  employees nor has the
Company or any of its subsidiaries  experienced any labor interruptions over the
past  three (3) years,  and the  Company  and its  subsidiaries  consider  their
relationships  with their employees to be good. The Company and its subsidiaries
are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable material foreign,
federal,  state and local laws,  rules and  regulations  respecting  employment,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours.

         (f) Except as set forth in SECTION  2.11(f)  of the  Company  Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  will (i)  result in any  payment  (including
severance,  unemployment  compensation,  golden  parachute,  bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any  stockholder,  director or employee of the Company or any of
its  subsidiaries  under any Plan or  otherwise,  (ii)  materially  increase any
benefits  otherwise  payable under any Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

         (g) Each  International  Employee  Plan  (as  defined  below)  has been
established,  maintained and administered in all material respects in compliance
with its terms and  conditions and with the  requirements  prescribed by any and
all  statutory or  regulatory  laws that are  applicable  to such  International
Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has material unfunded
liabilities  that, as of the Effective  Time, will not be offset by insurance or
fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition exists that would prevent
the Company or Parent from  terminating or amending any  International  Employee
Plan at any time for any reason. For purposes of this Agreement,  "INTERNATIONAL
EMPLOYEE  PLAN" shall mean each Plan that has been adopted or  maintained by the

                                      -17-

any of the Company Products, the Company has a written agreement with such third
party with  respect  thereto and the  Company  thereby  either (i) has  obtained
ownership of, and is the  exclusive  owner of, or (ii) has obtained a perpetual,
non-terminable  license (sufficient for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted   and  as  proposed  to  be  conducted)  to  all  such  third  party's
Intellectual Property in such work, material or invention by operation of law or
by valid assignment, to the fullest extent it is legally possible to do so.

         (i) Neither the Company  nor any of its  subsidiaries  has  transferred
ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Intellectual
Property that is material Company Intellectual  Property, to any third party, or

Property to lapse or enter the public domain.

accurate list of all material  contracts,  licenses and  agreements to which the

licensed  to the  Company  or any of its  subsidiaries,  are in full  force  and
effect.  Except as set forth in SECTION  2.19(k) of the  Company  Schedule,  the
consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement will neither
violate nor result in the breach,  modification,  cancellation,  termination  or

                                      -24-

suspension of such contracts,  licenses and agreements.  Each of the Company and
its  subsidiaries  is in material  compliance  with,  and has not  breached  any
material  term of any  such  contracts,  licenses  and  agreements  and,  to the
knowledge  of the Company,  all other  parties to such  contracts,  licenses and
agreements  are in compliance  with, and have not breached any material term of,

of the Company Schedule,  following the Closing Date, the Surviving  Corporation
will be permitted to exercise all of the Company's  rights under such contracts,
licenses  and  agreements  to the same extent the  Company and its  subsidiaries

occurred  and  without the payment of any  additional  amounts or  consideration
other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which the Company would otherwise
be  required  to pay.  Except as set forth in  SECTION  2.19(k)  of the  Company
Schedule,  neither this  Agreement  nor the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  including the assignment to Parent or Merger Sub by operation of law

party any right to or with respect to any material  Intellectual  Property right
owned by, or licensed to, either of them, (ii) either the Parent's or the Merger
Sub's  being  bound  by,  or  subject  to,  any  non-compete  or other  material
restriction on the operation or scope of their respective  businesses,  or (iii)
either the Parent's or the Merger Sub's being  obligated to pay any royalties or
other  material  amounts to any third party in excess of those payable by Parent
or Merger Sub, respectively, prior to the Closing.

         (l) Except as set forth in SECTION 2.19(l) of the Company Schedule,  to
the  knowledge of the Company,  the operation of the business of the Company and
its  subsidiaries  as such business  currently is  conducted,  including (i) the
Company's and its subsidiaries' design, development, manufacture,  distribution,
reproduction,  marketing or sale of the Company  Products and (ii) the Company's
use of any product,  device or process, has not, does not and, to its knowledge,
will not infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property of any third party
or  constitute  unfair  competition  or trade  practices  under  the laws of any
jurisdiction.

(m) Except as set forth in SECTION 2.19(m) of the Company Schedule,  neither the
Company nor any of its  subsidiaries  has  received  notice from any third party
that the operation of the business of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries or
any act, product or service of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, infringes
or misappropriates  the Intellectual  Property of any third party or constitutes
unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction.

         (n) To the knowledge of the Company,  no person has or is infringing or
misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property.

         (o) The Company and each of its subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps
to  protect  the  Company's  and  its  subsidiaries'  rights  in  the  Company's
confidential  information  and trade  secrets  that it wishes to  protect or any
trade  secrets or  confidential  information  of third  parties  provided to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, and, without limiting the foregoing, each of
the Company and its subsidiaries has and uses commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce a policy requiring each employee and contractor to execute a proprietary

information/confidentiality  agreement  substantially  in the form  provided  to
Parent and all current and former  employees and  contractors of the Company and
any of its  subsidiaries  have  executed  such an  agreement,  except  where the

calculate and present  calendar  dates falling on and after (and if  applicable,
spans of time  including)  January 1, 2000, and will  calculate any  information

functionality,  data integrity and performance,  as the products record,  store,

subsidiaries  is a party  or by  which  it is  bound  that  are  required  to be
disclosed in the Company Schedule (any such agreement, contract or commitment, a
"COMPANY  CONTRACT")  in such a manner as would permit any other party to cancel
or terminate any such Company Contract,  or would permit any other party to seek
material damages or other remedies (for any or all of such breaches,  violations

Company and its  subsidiaries.  There is no material claim by the Company or any

series of the Company's  capital stock  necessary to approve this  Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     2.25 PRIOR POOLING TRANSACTIONS; REORGANIZATION. To its knowledge, based on
consultation  with its independent  accountants,  neither the Company nor any of

<PAGE>

the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,  the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated hereby will not result in a grant of any rights

requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and

possession of all Approvals  necessary to own,  lease and operate the properties
it purports to own,  operate or lease and to carry on its  business as it is now
being  conducted,  except  where the failure to have such  Approvals  would not,

corporation to do business,  and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,  except for such

not, either individually or in the aggregate,  have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

     3.2  CERTIFICATE  OF  INCORPORATION  AND  BYLAWS.   Parent  has  previously
furnished  to the Company  complete  and correct  copies of its  Certificate  of
Incorporation  and Bylaws as  amended  to date  (together  the  "PARENT  CHARTER

liens,  claims,  pledges,  agreements,  limitations  in Parent's  voting rights,
charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

     3.4 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all  necessary  corporate  power and  authority  to  execute  and  deliver  this
Agreement,  and to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  and to  consummate  the

prevent Parent or Merger Sub from performing their respective  obligations under
this Agreement or (y) could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

    3.6 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

         (a) Parent has made  available  to the Company a correct  and  complete
copy of each report,  schedule,  registration  statement  and  definitive  proxy

SEC  REPORTS"),  which are all the forms,  reports and documents  required to be
filed by Parent with the SEC since August 25,  2000.  The Parent SEC Reports (i)
were prepared in accordance  with the  requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange  Act,  as the case may be, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed
(or if amended or  superseded  by a filing prior to the date of this  Agreement,
then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in
order to make the statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not  misleading.  None of Parent's  subsidiaries  is required to
file any reports or other documents with the SEC.

         (b) Each set of consolidated financial statements  (including,  in each
case,  any  related  notes  thereto)  contained  in the Parent SEC  Reports  was

case of unaudited statements, do not contain footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q
of the  Exchange  Act) and each fairly  presents in all  material  respects  the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its subsidiaries at the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated  results of its operations and cash flows for
the periods  indicated,  except that the unaudited interim financial  statements
were or are subject to normal  adjustments which were not or are not expected to
be material in amount.


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

     3.7 NO  MATERIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT.  Since  the  date of the  balance  sheet

Parent.

     3.8  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT;  PROXY  STATEMENT.  None  of the  information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 becomes  effective under the Securities
Act,  contain  any  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to state any
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading; and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the dates mailed to
the  stockholders  of the  Company,  at the  time of the  Company  Stockholders'
Meeting and as of the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  any  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The S-4 will comply as to form in all
material  respects with the  provisions of the  Securities Act and the rules and
regulations  promulgated by the SEC thereunder.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,
Parent  makes no  representation  or warranty  with  respect to any  information
supplied by the Company which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

     3.9  ABSENCE  OF  LITIGATION.  There  are  no  claims,  suits,  actions  or
proceedings  that have a reasonable  likelihood of success on the merits pending
or, to the  knowledge of Parent,  threatened  against,  relating to or affecting
Parent or any of its subsidiaries,  before any court,  governmental  department,
commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, of any arbitrator that seek to
restrain or enjoin the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated by this

the  Company  and  Parent  shall  prepare,  and file  with the  SEC,  the  Proxy

efforts to have the S-4 declared  effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as  practicable  after  such  filing,  and the  Company  shall  cause  the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus   to  be  mailed  to  its   stockholders  at  the  earliest
practicable time after the S-4 is declared  effective by the SEC. As promptly as
practicable  after the date of this  Agreement,  each of the  Company and Parent
shall  prepare and file any other  filings  required to be filed by it under the
Exchange Act, the Securities  Act or any other  Federal,  foreign or Blue Sky or
related laws relating to the Merger and the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement (the "OTHER FILINGS"). Each of the Company and Parent shall notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
other  government  officials  and of any  request by the SEC or its staff or any
other  government  officials for amendments or supplements to the S-4, the Proxy

supply the other with copies of all correspondence  between such party or any of
its  representatives,  on the one  hand,  and the SEC or its  staff or any other
government  officials,  on the other hand,  with  respect to the S-4,  the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus,  the Merger or any Other  Filing.  Each of the Company and
Parent shall cause all documents that it is responsible  for filing with the SEC
or other  regulatory  authorities  under  this  SECTION  5.1(a) to comply in all

                                      -36-

material  respects  with all  applicable  requirements  of law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.  Whenever any event occurs which is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
the S-4 or any Other  Filing,  the Company or Parent,  as the case may be, shall
promptly  inform the other of such  occurrence  and cooperate in filing with the
SEC  or  its  staff  or  any  other  government  officials,  and/or  mailing  to
stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

         (b) The Proxy  Statement/Prospectus shall include the recommendation of
the Board of  Directors of the Company in favor of adoption and approval of this
Agreement  and  approval  of the Merger  (subject  to the terms of  SECTION  5.2

     5.2 MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS.

         (a) Promptly  after the date hereof,  the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the Company  Charter  Documents to
convene the Company Stockholders' Meeting to be held as promptly as practicable,
for the purpose of voting  upon this  Agreement  and the Merger.  Subject to the
terms  of  SECTION  5.2(c)  hereof,  the  Company  shall  use  its  commercially
reasonable  efforts to  solicit  from its  stockholders  proxies in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and shall
take all other  action  necessary  or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
its stockholders  required by the rules of Nasdaq or Delaware Law to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company may adjourn or  postpone  the Company  Stockholders'  Meeting to the
extent  necessary to ensure that any  necessary  supplement  or amendment to the
Prospectus/Proxy  Statement is provided to the Company's stockholders in advance
of a vote on the Merger and this  Agreement  or, if as of the time for which the
Company  Stockholders'  Meeting  is  originally  scheduled  (as set forth in the
Prospectus/Proxy  Statement)  there are  insufficient  shares of Company  Common
Stock  represented  (either  in  person  or by  proxy)  to  constitute  a quorum
necessary  to conduct the  business of the Company  Stockholders'  Meeting.  The
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders' Meeting is called,  noticed,
convened,  held and conducted,  and that all proxies solicited by the Company in
connection with the Company Stockholders'  Meeting are solicited,  in compliance
with Delaware Law, the Company  Charter  Documents,  the rules of Nasdaq and all
other  applicable  legal  requirements.  The Company's  obligation to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with
this  SECTION  5.2(a)  shall not be  limited  to or  otherwise  affected  by the
commencement,  disclosure,  announcement  or  submission  to the  Company of any
Acquisition Proposal.

         (b)  Subject to the terms of SECTION  5.2(c)  hereof:  (i) the Board of
Directors  of  the  Company  shall  unanimously  recommend  that  the  Company's
stockholders  vote in favor of and  adopt and  approve  this  Agreement  and the
Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
shall  include a  statement  to the effect  that the Board of  Directors  of the
Company has  unanimously  recommended  that the Company's  stockholders  vote in
favor of and adopt and  approve  this  Agreement  and the Merger at the  Company
Stockholders'  Meeting;  and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve
to  withdraw,  amend or modify in a manner  adverse  to  Parent,  the  unanimous

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

recommendation  of the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  that the  Company's
stockholders  vote in favor of and  adopt and  approve  this  Agreement  and the
Merger.  For purposes of this  Agreement,  said  recommendation  of the Board of
Directors shall be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent if
said recommendation shall no longer be unanimous.

         (c) Nothing in this  Agreement  shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from withholding,  withdrawing,  amending or modifying its unanimous
recommendation  in favor of the  Merger if (i) a Superior  Offer (as  defined in
SECTION 5.4 hereof) is made to the Company and is not  withdrawn,  (ii)  neither
the  Company  nor any of its  representatives  shall  have  violated  any of the
restrictions  set forth in SECTION 5.4 hereof,  and (iii) the Board of Directors
of the Company  concludes  in good faith,  after  consultation  with its outside
counsel,  that, in light of such Superior Offer,  the  withholding,  withdrawal,
amendment or  modification of such  recommendation  is required in order for the
Board of  Directors  of the Company to comply with its  fiduciary  duties to the
Company's  stockholders under applicable law; provided,  however,  that prior to
any  commencement  thereof the Company  shall have given Parent at least seventy
two (72) hours notice  thereof and the  opportunity to meet with the Company and
its counsel.  Nothing  contained  in this SECTION 5.2 shall limit the  Company's
obligation to hold and convene the Company  Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of
whether the  unanimous  recommendation  of the Board of Directors of the Company
shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).

     5.3 CONFIDENTIALITY; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

         (a) The parties  acknowledge that Parent and H.C.  Wainwright & Co., as
the representative and agent of the Company,  have previously  executed a Mutual
Confidentiality  Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2000 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"),  which  Confidentiality  Agreement  will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

         (b) ACCESS TO  INFORMATION.  The Company  shall  afford  Parent and its
accountants,  counsel and other representatives  reasonable access during normal

all  information  concerning  the  business,  including  the  status of  product
development  efforts,  properties,  results of  operations  and personnel of the
Company,  as Parent may reasonably request. No information or knowledge obtained
by Parent in any  investigation  pursuant to this  SECTION 5.3 will affect or be
deemed  to  modify  any  representation  or  warranty  contained  herein  or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

     5.4 NO SOLICITATION.

banker,  attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to,
directly or indirectly  (i) solicit,  initiate,  encourage or induce the making,

                                      -38-

5.4(c) hereof),  (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations  regarding,

Proposal, (iv) subject to the terms of SECTION 5.2(c) hereof,  approve,  endorse

hereof);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the  terms of this  SECTION  5.4  shall  not
prohibit the Company from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Company
and its  subsidiaries  to,  entering into a  confidentiality  agreement  with or
entering into  discussions  with,  any person or group in response to a Superior
Offer  submitted by such person or group (and not  withdrawn) if (1) neither the
Company nor any  representative  of the Company and its subsidiaries  shall have
violated any of the restrictions set forth in this SECTION 5.4, (2) the Board of
Directors of the Company  concludes in good faith,  after  consultation with its
outside  legal  counsel,  that such action is required in order for the Board of
Directors of the Company to comply with its  fiduciary  duties to the  Company's
stockholders  under  applicable  law, (3) (x) at least three (3)  business  days
prior  to  furnishing  any such  nonpublic  information  to,  or  entering  into
discussions or negotiations with, such person or group, the Company gives Parent
written  notice of the  identity  of such  person or group and of the  Company's
intention to furnish  nonpublic  information  to, or enter into  discussions  or
negotiations  with, such person or group and (y) the Company  receives from such
person  or group an  executed  confidentiality  agreement  containing  customary
limitations  on the  use  and  disclosure  of all  nonpublic  written  and  oral
information  furnished  to such person or group by or on behalf of the  Company,
and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
person or group, the Company furnishes such nonpublic  information to Parent (to
the extent such nonpublic  information has not been previously  furnished by the
Company  to  Parent);  and  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  HOWEVER,  that the terms of this
SECTION 5.4 shall not prohibit  the Company from taking any action  necessary in
order to comply  with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2  promulgated  under the  Exchange
Act.  The  Company  and its  subsidiaries  shall  immediately  cease any and all
existing  activities,  discussions or  negotiations  with any parties  conducted
heretofore  with  respect to any  Acquisition  Proposal.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the  preceding two sentences by any officer or director of the Company or any of
its  subsidiaries  or any  investment  banker,  attorney  or  other  advisor  or
representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a

Proposal,  the  material  terms  and  conditions  of such  request,  Acquisition
Proposal or  inquiry,  and the  identity of the person or group  making any such

on  terms  that  the  Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  determines,  in its
reasonable  judgment  (based on  advice of a  financial  advisor  of  nationally

financial point of view than the terms of the Merger.

other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or

<PAGE>

otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or an  Acquisition  Proposal and shall not issue any such press  release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation,  except as may be required
by law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange. The parties
have agreed to the text of the joint  press  release  announcing  the signing of
this Agreement.

     5.6 REASONABLE EFFORTS; NOTIFICATION.

         (a) Upon the  terms and  subject  to the  conditions  set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,  and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,  all things  necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make  effective,  in the most  expeditious
manner practicable,  the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement,  including using reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:  (i)
the taking of all reasonable  acts  necessary to cause the conditions  precedent
set forth in ARTICLE VI to be  satisfied,  (ii) the  obtaining of all  necessary
actions or nonactions,  waivers, consents,  approvals, orders and authorizations
from  Governmental  Entities  and the  making  of all  necessary  registrations,
declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental  Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid any suit, claim,  action,  investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity,  (iii) the obtaining of all consents,  approvals or waivers
from third parties required as a result of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement,  (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,  investigations or
proceedings,  whether judicial or administrative,  challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby,  including seeking to

Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any
additional  instruments  reasonably  necessary to  consummate  the  transactions
contemplated  by, and to fully carry out the  purposes  of, this  Agreement.  In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of
Directors  shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
is  or  becomes  applicable  to  the  Merger,  this  Agreement  or  any  of  the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  use all  commercially  reasonable
efforts to ensure  that the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated  by
this  Agreement  may be  consummated  as  promptly as  practicable  on the terms
contemplated  by this  Agreement  and  otherwise  to minimize the effect of such
statute  or  regulation  on the  Merger,  this  Agreement  and the  transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  to  require  Parent  or the  Company  or any
subsidiary or affiliate  thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of
its  affiliates  of  shares  of  capital  stock or of any  business,  assets  or
property,  or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of
them to conduct  their  business or to own or exercise  control of such  assets,
properties and stock.

         (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming  aware
that any  representation  or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate  in any material  respect,  or of any failure of the
Company  to  comply  with or  satisfy  in any  material  respect  any  covenant,
condition  or  agreement  to be  complied  with or  satisfied  by it under  this
Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in SECTION 6.3(a) or

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

SECTION 6.3(b) hereof would not be satisfied;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such
notification  shall  affect  the  representations,   warranties,   covenants  or
agreements of the parties or the  conditions to the  obligations  of the parties
under this Agreement.

         (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming  aware
that any  representation  or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent or Merger
Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this  Agreement,  in each
case,  such that the  conditions  set forth in SECTION  6.2(a) or SECTION 6.2(b)
hereof would not be  satisfied;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such  notification
shall affect the  representations,  warranties,  covenants or  agreements of the
parties  or  the  conditions  to  the  obligations  of the  parties  under  this
Agreement.

     5.7 THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Parent and the Company  shall each use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements,  contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.8 STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

         (a) STOCK OPTIONS.  At the Effective  Time,  each Company Stock Option,
whether or not vested,  shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by Parent. Each
Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this  Agreement will continue to
have,  and be  subject  to,  the  same  terms  and  conditions  of such  options
immediately  prior to the Effective Time  (including,  without  limitation,  any
repurchase   rights  or  vesting   provisions  and   provisions   regarding  the
acceleration of vesting on certain  transactions),  except that (i) each Company
Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become  exercisable in accordance with
its terms) for that number of whole  shares of Parent  Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company  Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time
multiplied  by the Exchange  Ratio,  rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent  Common  Stock  and (ii) the per share  exercise  price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable  upon  exercise of such assumed  Company
Stock Option will be equal to the quotient  determined  by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company  Common Stock at which such Company  Stock Option was
exercisable  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time by the  Exchange  Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

         (b) ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
shall be exercised in accordance  with Section 13(b) of the ESPP, and each share
of Company Common Stock  purchased  pursuant to such exercise shall by virtue of
the  Merger,  and  without  any  action on the part of the  holder  thereof,  be
converted  into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent  Common  Stock
equal to the  Exchange  Ratio,  without  issuance of  certificates  representing
issued and outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock to participants under the
ESPP. The rights of  participants  in the ESPP with respect to any offering then
underway  under the ESPP shall be  determined  by treating the last business day
prior to the Effective  Time as the last day of such offering and by making such

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering
but  otherwise  treating  such  shortened  offering  as a  fully  effective  and
completed  offering for all purposes  under the ESPP. As of the Effective  Time,
the ESPP shall be terminated. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i)
provide  Parent  with  evidence  that the ESPP has been  terminated  pursuant to
resolutions  of the Board of Directors of the Company (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to prior  review and  approval of Parent),  and (ii) take
such other actions (including, without limitation, if appropriate,  amending the
ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transaction  contemplated by this
Section 5.8(b). Employees of the Company who become employees of Parent shall be
eligible to  participate  in the  employee  stock  purchase  plan of Parent (the
"PARENT  ESPP")  (subject  to such  plan's  terms  and  conditions)  at the next
regularly scheduled offering period under the Parent ESPP.

         (c) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent  shall  provide the  employees  of the Company and its  subsidiaries  who
remain employed after the Effective Time (each, a "TRANSFERRED COMPANY EMPLOYEE"
and collectively, the "TRANSFERRED COMPANY EMPLOYEES") with the types and levels
of employee benefits  maintained by Parent for similarly  situated  employees of
Parent.  Parent shall treat and cause its  applicable  benefit plans  (including
vacation  policies) to treat the service of Transferred  Company  Employees with
the Company or any  subsidiary  of the Company  prior to the  Effective  Time as
service  rendered  to  Parent  or  any  affiliate  of  Parent  for  purposes  of
eligibility  to  participate,   vesting  and  for  other  appropriate   benefits
(including,  without  limitation,  applicability  of minimum waiting periods for
participation (but not for benefit accrual)),  provided that such service credit
will not result in the duplication of benefits.  Transferred  Company  Employees
shall also be given  credit for any  deductible  or  co-payment  amounts paid in
respect of the plan year in which the Closing  Date  occurs to the extent  that,
following  the  Closing  Date,  they  participate  in  any  plan  of  Parent  or
subsidiaries  of Parent for which  deductibles  and  co-payments  are  requested
(subject  to the terms and  conditions  of such  plans  and the  cooperation  of
Parent's insurance carriers).

         (d) EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENTS.  Following the Effective Time, Parent shall
honor and shall cause its  subsidiaries  to honor in accordance with their terms
all individual employment, retention, termination, severance, change in control,
post-employment  and other compensation  agreements,  arrangements and plans set
forth in SECTION 5.8(d) of the Company Schedule.

         (e) EMPLOYEE TERMINATION.  Parent shall not terminate the employment of
any employees of the Company or any of its  subsidiaries who are employed by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries  immediately  prior to the Effective Time and
who accept  employment with Parent or any of its  subsidiaries,  effective as of
the  Effective  Time,  for a period  of sixty  (60)  calendar  days  immediately
following  the  Closing  Date;  PROVIDED,   HOWEVER,  that  notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  Parent may terminate  the  employment of any of such employee on the
basis of "cause" without  limitation  (including within such sixty (60) calendar
day period).

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

     5.9 FORM S-8.  Parent agrees to file,  within fifteen (15) business days of
the  Effective  Time,  a  registration  statement  on Form S-8 for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options.

     5.10 INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the  obligations of the Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors
and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES") and any indemnification provisions under the Company Charter Documents
as in effect on the date hereof.  The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving  Corporation  will contain  provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those  contained  in the  Company  Charter  Documents  as in  effect on the date
hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years  from the  Effective  Time in any  manner  that  would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,  immediately prior to
the  Effective  Time,  were  directors,  officers,  employees  or  agents of the
Company, unless such modification is required by applicable law.

         (b) At or prior to the  Effective  Time,  the  Company  may  purchase a
policy of directors' and officers' insurance approved in advance by Parent, or a
"tail" policy under the Company's  existing  directors' and officers'  insurance
policy, in either case which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently  covered by the
Company's  directors'  and officers'  insurance  policy in effect as of the date
hereof and only for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time,  (iii)  contains  terms and  conditions  (including,  without  limitation,
coverage amounts) that are no more favorable in the aggregate than the terms and
conditions of the Company's existing  directors' and officers'  insurance policy
in effect as of the date hereof, and (iv) has an aggregate cost of approximately
$335,000.

         (c) This SECTION 5.10 is intended for the  irrevocable  benefit of, and
to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified  Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the  Indemnified  Parties  shall be entitled  to enforce  the  covenants
contained in this SECTION 5.10.

         (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i)  consolidates  with or merges into any other person or
entity and shall not be the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  or entity of
such  consolidation  or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such
case,  proper  provision  shall be made so that the  successors  and  assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations
set forth in this SECTION 5.10.

     5.11 NYSE  LISTING.  Parent  agrees to cause the listing on the NYSE of the
shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable,  and those  required to be reserved for
issuance, in connection with the Merger, subject to official notice of issuance.

     5.12 AFFILIATE  AGREEMENT.  SECTION 5.12 of the Company Schedule contains a
complete  and  accurate  list of those  persons  who may be deemed to be, in the
Company's reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of
Rule 145 promulgated  under the Securities Act (each, a "COMPANY  AFFILIATE" and
collectively,  the "COMPANY AFFILIATES").  The Company shall provide Parent with
such  information  and documents as Parent  reasonably  requests for purposes of
reviewing such list.  Parent shall be entitled to place  appropriate  legends on
the certificates  evidencing any Parent Common Stock to be received by a Company
Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue appropriate stop
transfer  instructions  to the  transfer  agent  for the  Parent  Common  Stock,
consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Agreements.

practicable,  the  Company  and Parent  each  shall file with the United  States
Federal Trade  Commission  (the "FTC") and the Antitrust  Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "DOJ")  Notification and Report Forms relating
to the transactions  contemplated  herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as
comparable pre-merger  notification forms required by the merger notification or
control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the
parties.  The Company and Parent each shall  promptly  (a) supply the other with
any  information  which may be required in order to effectuate  such filings and
(b) supply any additional  information  which  reasonably may be required by the
FTC,  the DOJ or the  competition  or merger  control  authorities  of any other
jurisdiction  and which the parties may reasonably deem  appropriate;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent
or the  Company  or any of  Parent's  subsidiaries  or  affiliates  of shares of
capital  stock  or of  any  business,  assets  or  property  of  Parent  or  its
subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company, its affiliates,  or the imposition
of any  material  limitation  on the  ability  of any of them to  conduct  their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

     5.14 401(K) PLAN. Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company and its  Affiliates,  as applicable,  shall each terminate any
and all plans  intended to include a Code  Section  401(k)  arrangement  (unless
Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not
be terminated).  Unless Parent  provides such written notice to the Company,  no
later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing  Date,  the Company shall
provide  Parent with  evidence  that such 401(k)  plan(s)  have been  terminated
(effective as of the day  immediately  preceding  the Closing Date)  pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company.  The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent.  The Company
also shall take such other actions in  furtherance  of  terminating  such 401(k)
plan(s) as Parent may reasonably  request. In the event that such 401(k) plan(s)
is/are not merged  with and into the Parent  401(k)  Plan,  Transferred  Company
Employees who have outstanding loans from such 401(k) plan(s) shall be permitted
to make a direct  rollover  of their loan  balances to the Parent  401(k)  Plan,
provided  that (i) such  rollovers  are  permitted by the  administrator  of the
Parent 401(k) Plan and (ii) such rollover includes any such Transferred  Company
Employee's entire distribution amount that is an eligible rollover  distribution
pursuant to the Parent 401(k) Plan.
