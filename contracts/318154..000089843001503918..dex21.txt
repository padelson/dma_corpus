         ----------
"Company").
 -------

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
              ------
Agreement and in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of the State of
Washington (the "WBCA");
                 ----

                  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the
Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with
their respective business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective shareholders, and Parent has approved this Agreement and the Merger
as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub;

                  WHEREAS, as a condition to and inducement to Parent's and
Merger Sub's willingness to enter into this Agreement, simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, American Home Products Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and shareholder of the Company ("AHP"), is entering into a
Shareholder Voting Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub (the "Voting
                                                              ------
Agreement");
---------

                  WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and
                                                              ----

                  WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used herein are defined

                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in
this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1.

another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual
date of the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing
                                                     ------------

        Section 1.4   Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.
                      ---------------------------------

        (a) Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to
read as the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that Article I thereof
shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is Immunex
Corporation." Such Articles shall not be inconsistent with Section 6.10.

        (b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein

        Section 1.5   Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The
                      ---------------------------------------------------

               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

        Section 2.1   Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue

of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or

                                       2

<PAGE>


     (a) Conversion Generally. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
                        --------------------
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and dissenting shares referred
to in Section 2.1(e)) shall be converted, subject to Section 2.2(e), into the
right to receive (i) 0.440 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock,
                                 --------------
par value $0.0001 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), of Parent (the "Common
                              -------------------                    ------
Stock Consideration") and (ii) $4.50 in cash (the "Cash Consideration," and
-------------------                                ------------------
together with the Common Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). All
                                                   --------------------
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock.

     (b) Parent-Owned Shares. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

     (c) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     (d) Change in Shares. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Exchange Ratio and the Option Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly
adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

     (e) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the
holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Chapter
23B.13 of the WBCA as to dissenters' rights (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if
                                                      ----------------
any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving
Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the
circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the WBCA, affirmatively
withdraws such holder's demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if
any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish such holder's entitlement to
dissenters' rights as provided in the WBCA or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such
holder is not entitled to payment for such holder's shares under the WBCA, such
holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of
such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company
Common

                                       3

<PAGE>

Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any
payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to
Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

                (f)   Associated Rights. References in this Agreement to Parent
 Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the
associated Preferred Share Purchase Rights issued pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement dated as of December 12, 2000 between Parent and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Plan").
                                                                 -----------

     Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.
                 ------------------------

                (a)  Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the
                                  --------------
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange, in accordance with this
Article 2, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock to make all deliveries pursuant to
this Article 2. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(e) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and certificates
representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
the proceeds from sales of Excess Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e))
shall be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."
                             -------------

                (b)  Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") (i)
                                                             ------------
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary
form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock may be paid to a

                                       4

<PAGE>

transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

     (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock, with a record date after the Effective Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat,
Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to such holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
promptly, the amount of any cash due pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date at or after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a
record date at or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

     (d) Further Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or
Section 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

     (e) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a
stockholder of Parent.

         (i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the closest number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock represented by the aggregate of the fractional share interests in
Parent Common Stock to which all holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
(the "Excess Shares"). As soon after the Effective Time as practicable, the
      -------------
Exchange Agent, as agent for such holders of Parent Common Stock, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on Nasdaq, all in the manner
provided in this Section 2.2(e).

                                       5

<PAGE>

         (ii)   The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on Nasdaq through one or more member firms of Nasdaq and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of any
such sale or sales have been distributed to such holders of Company Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders of
Company Common Stock as part of the Exchange Fund. All commissions, transfer
Taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange Agent incurred
in connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares shall be deducted from
the Exchange Fund. In addition, the Exchange Agent's compensation and expenses
in connection with such sale or sales shall be deducted from the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which
each holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction the numerator of which is
the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company
Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued to such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common
Stock are entitled.

         (iii)  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders of Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance with the
terms of this Article 2.

     (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and, from and
after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.

     (g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     (h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each
case, without any interest thereon.

     (i) Withholding. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

     (j) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(f). In the
event the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all
of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent
shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment
obligations.

     Section 2.3 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
                 --------------------
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), without any interest thereon.

     Section 2.4 Stock Options.
                 -------------

     (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option, other than Cancelled
Company Options, then outstanding under any Company Stock Option Plan, whether
or not then exercisable, shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent
Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.4(a). Each Company Option so
converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Option
shall be exercisable (or shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms)
for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 0.52 (the "Option Exchange
                                                                 ---------------

quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option

Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) each Company
Option which (a) is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (b) remains
outstanding at the Effective Time, and (c) constitutes an Accelerated Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be fully vested and
exercisable as to all shares of Parent Common Stock subject thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion of any Company Options which are
"incentive stock options," within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into
options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so as not to constitute a
"modification" of such Company Options within the meaning of Section 424 of the
Code.

     (b) At the Effective Time, each Cancelled Company Option then outstanding
under any Company Stock Option Plan shall be cancelled, and in exchange
therefor, shall be converted into an option ("Replacement Option") to purchase
                                              ------------------
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares subject to the related Cancelled Company Option multiplied by
0.4, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of
Parent Common Stock as of the date of grant of the Replacement Option (which
shall be as of the close of market on the date of the Effective Time)and
otherwise subject to the terms and conditions (including the vesting schedule)
that were applicable to the related Cancelled Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and neither the vesting nor exercisability of any
Cancelled Company Option or Replacement Option shall be accelerated except as
provided in the addendums to the Company Stock Option Plans.

     Section 2.5   Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, each
                   ----------------------------
outstanding purchase right under the Immunex Corporation 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") shall be assumed by Parent in such manner that Parent
                    ----
is a corporation "issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which
Section 424(a) applies" within the meaning of the Code, and shall be converted
into a right to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section
2.5. Each purchase right so assumed and converted by Parent under this Agreement
will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in the ESPP and the documents governing the outstanding purchase rights
under the ESPP, immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
purchase price of shares of Parent Common Stock and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of such purchase rights shall
be adjusted in accordance with the Option Exchange Ratio.

     Section 2.6   Employment Agreement.  Simultaneously with the execution of

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (and subject to Section 9.13 hereof), the Company
 -------------------------
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

     Section 3.1   Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is
                   --------------------------------------------
a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the State of
Washington and has paid all excise taxes required by the Washington Department
of Revenue. Each Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the "Company
                                                               -------
Subsidiaries") has been duly organized and is validly existing under the Laws of
------------
the State of Washington and has paid all excise taxes required by the Washington
Department of Revenue, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or
to have paid taxes would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
power, authority and governmental approvals would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business, and is in good standing (but only with respect to jurisdictions
which recognize such concepts) in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing or good standing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list of all of the Company Subsidiaries. Except with respect
to securities of non-affiliates held for investment purposes which do not
constitute more than a 5% percent interest in any such non-affiliate, neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other
person.

Company Subsidiary is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or
other Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or obligating
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of its capital

Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and

     Section 6.4 No Solicitation of Transactions.
                 -------------------------------

     (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Company Subsidiary shall,
and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the
making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (except to the
extent specifically permitted pursuant to this Section 6.4), (iii) engage in
discussions with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except to
notify such person as to the existence of these provisions (except to the extent
specifically permitted pursuant to this Section 6.4), (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect the Company (except to the
extent specifically permitted pursuant to this Section 6.4), or (v) enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, commitment or
understanding contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
a transaction contemplated thereby (except for confidentiality agreements
specifically permitted pursuant to Section 6.4(c)). The Company shall
immediately terminate, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or negotiations,
if any, with any third party with respect to, or any that could reasonably be
expected to lead to or contemplate the possibility of, an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall immediately demand that each person which has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates
or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to such
person's consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal to immediately return
or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing by such person to
the Company) all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company or
any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to
such person or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives.

     (b) Promptly after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry which it reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written notice of
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, and a copy of all written materials provided in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. After receipt of
the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company shall promptly keep
Parent informed in all material respects of the status and details (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all
written materials subsequently provided in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

     (c) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which (i) constitutes a
Superior Proposal or (ii) which the Board of Directors of the Company in good
faith concludes proposes consideration that is more favorable to the Company's
shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal in all other
respects, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent written notice that shall
state expressly (A) that it has received an Acquisition Proposal which

                                       37

<PAGE>

constitutes a Superior Proposal or which could reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal, and (B) the identity of the party making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal (the "Superior Proposal Notice") and may then take the following
              --------------------------
actions:

         (i)  furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal, provided, that (A) prior to so furnishing, the Company
receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such third party on its behalf and customary
standstill provisions, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such third party, the Company furnishes a copy of such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished); and

         (ii) engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal.

     (d) For a period of not less than five Business Days after Parent's receipt
from the Company of each Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if
requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this
Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal
no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal.

     (e) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after the Company's
compliance with Section 6.4(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may
withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation and, in the case of a Superior
Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its shareholders,
may recommend that its shareholders accept the tender or exchange offer (any of
the foregoing actions, whether by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof,
a "Change of Recommendation"), if both of the following conditions in Sections
  --------------------------
6.4(e)(i) and 6.4(e)(ii) are met:

         (i)  the Company Shareholders' Meeting has not occurred; and

         (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith,
following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of
such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change
of Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its
shareholders under applicable Law.

     (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
(i) the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Shareholders' Meeting and to hold a vote of the Company's shareholders
on this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholders' Meeting shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement
or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Proposal), or by any Change of Recommendation and (ii) in any case in which the
Company withholds or withdraws the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section

Agreement, the Company shall submit this Agreement and the Merger to a vote of
its shareholders with no recommendation as permitted by Section 23B.11.030(2) of
the WBCA. The Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or
propose to do so.

     (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or be
deemed to restrict the Company or Parent from making such other disclosures as
may be required by federal securities laws or applicable State of Washington
fiduciary duties laws.

     (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the prohibitions contained in Sections 5.l(j) and 5.1(l) shall not be applicable

     Section 6.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.
                 -------------------------------------

     (a) Subject to the proviso contained in Section 6.5(b)(ii), the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required (A) to
be obtained or made by Parent or the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, (B)
to avoid any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (including, without
limitation, those in connection with the HSR Act and antitrust and competition
Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction), in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, including, without limitation, the Merger,
and (C) to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or
after the Effective Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring
after the Effective Time, and (iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and antitrust and
competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and (C) any other
applicable Law. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all filings referenced in the preceding sentence,
including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company and Parent
shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each
shall consult the other on, all the information relating to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company may, as each
deems reasonably advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
information provided to the other under this Section 6.5(a) as "outside counsel
only." Such information shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient.
In addition, Parent and the Company may redact any information from such
documents shared with the other party or its counsel that is not pertinent to
the subject matter of the filing or submission.

                                       39

<PAGE>

     (b) Without limiting Section 6.5(a), Parent and the Company shall:

         (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any person;
and

         (ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date), including implementing, contesting or resisting
any litigation before any court or quasi-judicial administrative tribunal
seeking to restrain or enjoin the Merger; provided, however, that nothing in
this Agreement shall require any of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company
and its Subsidiaries to commit to any divestitures, licenses or hold separate or
similar arrangements with respect to its assets or conduct of business
arrangements, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from a
Governmental Entity or any other person or for any other reason, if, in any such
case, such divestiture, license, holding separate or arrangement (x) is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (y) would, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (including, for purposes of
this clause, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) after giving effect
to the Merger.

     (c) Subject to the proviso contained in Section 6.5(b)(ii) and the proviso
contained in the following sentence of this Section 6.5(c), the Company and
Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any
notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any non-governmental third party
consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) required to be disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, or (iii)
required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or
after the Effective Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring
after the Effective Time. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain
any third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 6.5(c),
such party shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent; provided that no
obligation to make a material payment or grant a material right not conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger shall be imposed by this Section 6.5(c).

     (d) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company or Parent, as appropriate, threatened action, suit,
arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or
any other person (i) challenging or seeking damages in connection with the
Merger or the conversion of Company Common Stock into Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation
of the Merger or otherwise limit the right of Parent or its Subsidiaries to own
or operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

     Section 6.6   Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement
                   ---------------
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to
comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit
or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

     Section 6.7   Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult
                   --------------------
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and make reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement
with Nasdaq, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation; provided, however, that each of Parent and
the Company may make any public statement in response to specific questions by
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or
financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal non-public
information regarding the other party.

     Section 6.8   Nasdaq Listing. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts (a)
                   --------------
to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing upon the Effective Time on Nasdaq or on such national securities
exchange as the Parent Common Stock is listed and (b) to cause the Parent Common
Stock issued upon the exercise of converted Company Options to be approved for
listing on Nasdaq or on such national securities exchange as Parent Common Stock
is listed.

    Section 6.9   Employee Benefit Matters.
                  ------------------------

    (a) For a period of at least two years following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide employee benefits (excluding any benefits attributable to equity
based plans or grants) to the employees and former employees of the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries ("New Parent Employees") that are no less
                                --------------------
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such persons in effect on the
date hereof. Nothing herein shall require Parent to continue any particular
Company Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment or termination thereof (subject to
the maintenance, in the aggregate, of the benefits as provided in the preceding
sentence); provided, however, that Parent shall not take any action (by way of
amendment, termination or otherwise) which is in violation of the terms of any
Company Benefit Plan or applicable Law.

     (b) With respect to each benefit plan of Parent ("Parent Benefit Plan") in
                                                       -------------------
which New Parent Employees subsequently participate, for purposes of
determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance
benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for

                                       41

<PAGE>

accrual of pension benefits), service with the Company (or predecessor employers
to the extent the Company provides past service credit) shall be treated as
service with Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the
extent that such service was not recognized under the applicable Company Benefit
Plan. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any
pre-existing condition limitations. Each Parent Benefit Plan shall waive
pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan. New Parent Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Parent Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

     (c) At the request of Parent, the Company shall terminate any and all
401(k) plans of the Company, effective not later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k)
plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of Company's Board of
Directors (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date.

     Section 6.10   Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
                    -----------------------------------------

     (a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) in their capacities as such.

     (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of
the Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the "D&O Insurance") covering each such person currently covered
                     -------------
by the officers' and directors' liability insurance policies of the Company on
terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of
the Company's policies in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the D&O
Insurance in excess of 200% of the estimated premium for the 2002 fiscal year,
which premium the Company presently expects to be approximately $1,850,000.

     (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be
maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation's (or any successor's)
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provisions with respect to indemnification
and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the intended
beneficiaries as those contained in the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof.

                                       42

<PAGE>

     (d) Parent agrees to honor (and hereby guarantees the Surviving
Corporation's performance under) all indemnification agreements entered into by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. In the event that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 6.10 applies without the express written consent
of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to
whom this Section 6.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.10).

     Section 6.11   Plan of Reorganization.  This Agreement is intended to
                    ----------------------
constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-2(g).

     Section 6.12   Affiliate Letters. The Company shall, promptly after the
                    -----------------
date hereof and prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy/Prospectus, deliver to
Parent a list setting forth the names of all persons the Company expects to be,
at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall furnish
such information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose
of reviewing the list. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
each person who is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or
supplemented pursuant to this Section 6.12 to execute a written agreement,
promptly following the date hereof, in substantially the form of Exhibit 6.12
hereto.

     Section 6.13   Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time: (a) the
                    ------------------
Board of Directors of Parent, or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive
guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer or director of the
Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, "Section
                                                                       -------
16"), of shares of Parent Common Stock or options to purchase shares of Parent
--
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16; and (b) the Board of Directors of the
Company or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that
the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered
person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

     Section 6.14   Stock Award Matters.
                    -------------------

     (a) The Company shall, and shall cause the administrator(s) of each of the
Company Stock Option Plans and the ESPP to, take any and all actions necessary
(under the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and otherwise) to (i) cause the
Company Options to be treated in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof, including,
without limitation, amending the

                                       43

<PAGE>

Company Stock Option Plans and, if necessary or desirable, obtaining the consent
of the optionholders to such treatment; and (ii) cause the stock purchase rights
outstanding under the ESPP to be assumed and converted into rights to purchase
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 in such manner as will not result in
acceleration of the exercise of stock purchase rights under the ESPP.

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
other successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to options and purchase rights issued pursuant to
Sections 2.4 and 2.5 and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.

     Section 6.15   Restructure of Transaction. In the event that either of
                    --------------------------
Latham & Watkins, counsel to Parent, or Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
LLP, counsel to the Company, is unable to render its opinion pursuant to Section
7.2(c) or Section 7.3(c), respectively, the structure of the Merger shall be
revised to provide for the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub with
Merger Sub being the surviving entity in such Merger (the "Forward Subsidiary
                                                           ------------------
Merger"), subject to the approval of each of the Company and Parent which
------
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that if a
Forward Subsidiary Merger structure would not result in each of Latham & Watkins
or Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP being able to render such respective
opinions, the Company and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to revise the
structure of the business combination between the Company and Parent such that
each of Latham & Watkins and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP will be
able to render such opinion; provided, further, that no such revision to the
structure of the Merger shall (a) result in any change in the Merger
Consideration, (b) be materially adverse to the interests of Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub, the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock or the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock or (c) unreasonably impede or delay
consummation of the Merger. If the structure of the Merger is so revised, this
Agreement shall be amended by the parties as appropriate to give effect to the
revised structure of the Merger with each party executing a written amendment to
this Agreement as necessary to reflect the foregoing.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

which is in effect and which prevents or prohibits consummation of the Merger.

     (d) Consents and Approvals. Other than the filing provided for under
Section 1.2 and filings pursuant to the HSR Act, all consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Entity required of Parent, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger, the failure of which to be
obtained or taken, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of this clause, after giving
effect to the Merger), shall have been obtained.

     (e) HSR Act. The applicable waiting periods, together with any extensions
thereof, under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated.

or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of
the business or assets of the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or (ii) seeking divestiture of any shares of Company Common Stock
(or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or seeking to impose or
confirm limitations on the ability of Parent to effectively exercise full rights
of ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation), including the right to vote any securities on any
matters properly presented to shareholders, in the case of clause (i) or (ii),
