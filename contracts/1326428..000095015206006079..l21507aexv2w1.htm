experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Interests. 

   

(G) _Restricted Securities_ Purchaser understands that the Interests will not
have been registered pursuant to the Securities Act or any applicable state
securities laws, that the Interests will be characterized as "restricted

that under such laws and applicable regulations the Interests cannot be sold
or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or an
exemption therefrom. 

   

(H) _Accredited Investor; Investment Intent_. Purchaser is an accredited
investor as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser is
acquiring the Interests for its own account for investment and not with a
view to, or for sale or other disposition in connection with, any

federal and state securities laws. 

   

(I) _Independent Evaluation_. Seller is an experienced and knowledgeable
investor in the oil and gas business and the business of owning and operating
oil, gas and mineral properties. Purchaser has had access to the Properties,
the Managers, officers, consultants and other representatives of the Seller
and the Companies, and the books, records, and files of the Seller and the

this Agreement and to consummate the Transaction, Purchaser has relied only on
(i) the basis of its own independent due diligence investigation of the
Properties, and (ii) the representations and warranties made by the Seller
and the Companies in Sections 3.1 and 3.3, respectively, and has been advised
by and has relied solely on its own expertise and legal, land, tax, reservoir
engineering, and other professional counsel concerning this Transaction, the
Properties, and the value thereof. 

  

     3.3  |   | _Representations and Warranties of Seller Concerning
the Companies_. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:  
---|---|--- 
   

   

(A) _Status of Companies_. Blacksand Acquisition, Blacksand GP and Blacksand
Brea are limited liability companies duly organized, validly existing, and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Blacksand Partners is
a limited partnership duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Texas. Each Company (i) is duly qualified to

which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it, or
the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such qualification,
(ii) has the relevant entity power and authority necessary to own or lease
its properties and to carry on its businesses as currently conducted, and

duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (to the extent
allowed by Law) in accordance with their respective organizational
documents. 

   

(C) _Records_. Copies of the Companies organizational documents that were
provided to Purchaser are in all material respects accurate and complete and
reflect all amendments made through the Closing Date. The Companies other
records made available to Purchaser for review were in all material respects
correct and complete as of the date of such review. 

   ##### 

  

   

(D) _Financial Statements_. Set forth on _Schedule 3.3 (D)_ are the
following financial statements (the " _Financial Statements_ "): (a) (i)
audited balance sheets and statements of income, changes in partners equity
and cash flow for Blacksand Partners as of and for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2004 and (ii) audited balance sheets and statements of
income, changes in Members equity and cash flow for the Companies on
a consolidated basis as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005;
and (b) unaudited balance sheet (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet_ ") and
statements of income, changes in Members equity and cash flow for the
Companies on a consolidated basis (the " _Interim Financial Statements_ ") as
of and for the three (3) months ended March 31, 2006 (the " _Balance Sheet
Date_ "). The Financial Statements have been prepared on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby, present fairly the financial
condition of the Companies on a consolidated basis as of such dates and the
results of operations and cash flow of the Companies on a consolidated basis
for such periods; _provided, however_ , that the Interim Financial Statements
are subject to normal non-material year-end adjustments and lack
of footnotes. The Financial Statements are correct, complete and consistent
with the books and records of the Companies. 

   

(E) _Subsequent Events_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(E)_, since
the Balance Sheet Date, each Company has operated in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past custom and practice (including with respect to
quantity, quality and frequency) (" _Ordinary Course of Business_ "), and,
from the Balance Sheet Date to the Closing Date, there have been no events,
series of events, or the lack of occurrence thereof that, singularly or in
the aggregate, have had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. 

   

(F) _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Companies do not have any liability
or obligation in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) in the
aggregate (and there is no basis for any present or future Action against a
Company giving rise to any liability or obligation), except for (i)
liabilities reflected or reserved against on the Most Recent Balance Sheet
(rather than disclosed in any notes thereto) and not paid or discharged
prior to Closing and (ii) liabilities arising after the Balance Sheet Date in
the Companys Ordinary Course of Business which, individually or in the
aggregate, are not material and are of the same character and nature as the
liabilities and obligations reflected or reserved against on the Most Recent
Balance Sheet (rather than disclosed in any notes thereto) and which do not
(a) result from or relate to any tort, infringement, breach, violation of or
default under any Law, Order or Contract or (b) arise out of any Action
or Order. 

   

(G) _Legal Compliance_. No Company or any of its predecessors and Affiliates
either is in violation of any applicable Law, rule, regulation, judgment,
injunction, Order or decree. 

   

(H) _Taxes_. Each Company is not subject to any liability or obligation for
any federal, state, local, or foreign income, gross receipts, value added,
license, payroll, employment, excise, occupation, customs, ad valorem,
duties, franchise, withholding, social security, unemployment, real property,
personal property, sales, use, transfer, registration, estimated or other tax
of any kind whatsoever, including any interest, penalty or addition thereto,
whether disputed or not (" _Taxes_ "), including Taxes relating to periods or
portions 

   ##### 

  

    

thereof ending on the Effective Date, other than those reflected or
reserved against on the Most Recent Balance Sheet (rather than disclosed in
any notes thereto) or those incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
Companys Ordinary Course of Business. Each Company has filed when due all
required Tax reports and returns in connection with and in respect of its
business, assets and employees, and has timely paid and discharged
all amounts shown as due thereon. All such Tax returns are true and complete
in all material respects. Seller and each Company have made available to
Purchaser accurate and complete copies of all of the Companys Tax reports
and returns for all periods, except those periods for which returns are not
yet due. There are no, and there is no basis for any, pending or threatened
claims, assessments, notices, deficiencies or audits with respect to any
Taxes owed or allegedly owed by any Company. None of the Tax reports and
returns filed by any Company has been audited or subject to an audit. Each
Company has not received any notice of any Tax deficiency outstanding,
proposed or assessed against or allocable to it, and has not executed any
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of
any Tax or executed or filed with any Governmental Authority any Contract now
in effect extending the period for assessment or collection of any Taxes
against it. Each Company has not received written notice of a claim made by
any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where such entity does not file Tax
returns that such entity is or may be subject to Tax in such jurisdiction. 
_Schedule 3.3(H)_ sets forth a list of states, territories and jurisdictions
(whether foreign or domestic) in which the Companies file Tax returns.
No claim has been made by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where such
entity does not file a return that it is subject to Tax in that jurisdiction
and no such entity is required to file Tax returns in any jurisdiction other
than those set forth in _Schedule 3.3(H)_. Each Company will not be required
to make any adjustments with respect to a change in Tax accounting methods
and no such entity has proposed such adjustment or received written notice
that the IRS or another tax authority has proposed such adjustment. Each
Company has not deferred income reportable for a current Tax period (or
portion thereof) or a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date but that is attributable to a transaction (e.g., an installment sale)
occurring in a period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date. Each Company has not consummated or entered into or is currently
participating in any transaction that was or is a "tax shelter", "listed
transaction", or "reportable transaction" as defined in Sections 6662, 6662A,
6011, 6012, 6111 or 6707A of the Code or the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, including, but not limited to, a transaction that
would be reportable under Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4. Except for
taxes incurred but not yet due, there are no Encumbrances for Taxes upon, or
pending or threatened against, any Company. Each Company is not subject to
any Tax allocation or sharing Contract. Each Company (i) has not been
a member of an "affiliated group" filing a consolidated federal income Tax
return and (ii) has no liability or obligation for the Taxes of any other
person under the Code or any regulations promulgated thereunder, as a
transferee or successor, by Contract, or otherwise. 

   

(I) _Property; Title_. _Schedule 3.3(I)_ describes (a) all personal
property owned by each Company related to its business and operations and (b)
the Properties, including (i) all real property which each Company owns,
leases, operates or subleases in each case specifying the ownership or other
interest of each Company in such real property and (ii) all oil and gas
leases and fee interests in oil and gas in which each Company has an 

   ##### 

  

    

interest (each a " _Lease_ "). Each Company has good and marketable title to
all of its interests in the Properties, as reflected on  _Schedule 3.3(I)_,
and the right to convey the Properties free and clear of any and all liens,
mortgages, pledges, claims, charges, options, defects, preferential purchase
rights, requirements for consent to assignment or other encumbrances. 

   

(J) _Intellectual Property_. As used in this Agreement, " _Intellectual
Property_ " means any rights, licenses, charges, Encumbrances, equities and
other claims that any person may have to claim ownership, authorship or
invention of, to use, to object to or prevent the modification of or to
withdraw from circulation or control the publication or distribution of, any:
(i) copyrights in both published works and unpublished works, (ii)
fictitious business names, trading names, corporate names, registered and
unregistered trademarks, service marks and applications, (iii) any (a)

discoveries that may be patentable, (iv) computer software or middleware and
(v) know-how, trade secrets, confidential information, customer
lists, software (source code and object code), technical information, data,

_Schedule 3.3(J)_, each Company owns, or possesses legally enforceable
rights to use, all Intellectual Property used in its business as currently,
or as currently proposed to be, conducted by the Company. Each Companys use
of the Intellectual Property in its business as currently conducted (and the
operation of its business) does not, and the use of such Intellectual Property
by the Company and its Affiliates after Closing will not, infringe, violate
or constitute misappropriation of any rights any other person owns or
holds. 

   

(K) _Contracts_. _Schedule 3.3(K)_ lists the following Contracts to which
one or more of the Companies are a party and which relate to the ownership
operation, use maintenance and use of the Properties, other than oil, gas
and mineral leases (the " _Material Contracts_ "). Except as provided for in
one or more of the Material Contracts, there are no Contracts: (i) that can
reasonably be expected to result in aggregate payments by the Companies of
more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), (ii) that is not
terminable without penalty on sixty (60) days or fewer notice during the
current or any subsequent calendar year, (iii) that is an indenture,
mortgage, loan, credit, sale-leasebacks or similar financial agreement
representing indebtedness for borrowed monies where the Company is a borrower
or a guarantor, (iv) that constitutes a lease under which the Company is
the lessor or the lessee of real or personal property which lease (a) cannot
be terminated by the Company without penalty upon sixty (60) days or fewer
notice and (b) involves an annual base rental of more than One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000.00), or (v) that contains an area of mutual interest
provision or restriction on the acquisition of mineral interests or
other similar provisions that would be binding upon Purchaser after Closing.
The copies of such Material Contracts provided to Purchaser are true and
complete. Each Material Contract is legal, valid and enforceable. 

   

(L) _Litigation_. _Schedule 3.3(L)_ sets forth each instance in which a
Company (i) is subject to any outstanding Order or (ii) is a party to, the
subject of or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened to be made a party to

   #####

coverages shall either: (i) be terminated by Seller as to the Companies; or
(ii) to the extent possible, be assumed by Purchaser for the term of
the coverages assumed, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, and with no
cost, expense, liability or continuing obligation of Seller.

obligation to contribute to, and have not in any time within six (6) years
prior to the Closing Date sponsored, maintained or contributed to or had an
obligation to contribute to, and no Employee Benefit Plan that is or has been
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Seller or any of its Present ERISA
Affiliates is, (A) a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA or (B) any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA,
or Section 412 of the Code that could reasonably result in any Material
Controlled Group Liability of Seller, the Companies or their respective
Present ERISA Affiliates; and (iii) to Sellers and each Company Managers
Knowledge, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist,
in either case specifically with respect to assets acquired from Brea Fields
LLC, a California limited liability company, Tonner Canyon LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, Brea Cañon Oil Co., Inc., a California

(A) under Title IV of ERISA, (B) under section 302 of ERISA, and (C) under
sections 412 and 4971 of the Code that are material and could reasonably
become liabilities of Purchaser, the Companies and their respective Present
ERISA Affiliates or that could reasonably result in the imposition of a lien
upon any of their assets. Nothwithstanding anything else provided for in this
Section 3.3(N), Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser or its Affiliates for
an amount in excess of $800,000 in the aggregate relating to any liability
associated with a breach of any or all of Sellers representations and
warranties contained in this Section 3.3(N).

to the Properties. All commodity hedge positions burdening the Properties are
subject to the ISDA Master Agreement.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_  

   

     10.1  |   | _Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. Except for the Parties agreements, representations, warranties
and covenants contained in Sections 2.6(A), 2.6(B), 2.6(C), 3.1(A), 3.1(C),
3.2(B), 3.3(N), 3.3(S), 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 7.3 and 7.4, which
shall terminate on March 31, 2007, all representations, warranties and
covenants will terminate at Closing.  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.2  |   | _Indemnification Provisions for Seller s and the Companies
Benefit_. " _Damages_ " means all losses, damages and other costs and
expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown,
contingent or vested, matured or unmatured, and whether or not resulting from
third-party claims, including costs (including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, other professional advisors and expert witnesses and
the allocable portion of the relevant persons internal costs) of
investigation, preparation and litigation in connection with any Action or
threatened Action. Purchaser will indemnify and hold Seller and each Company
and their Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents, representatives, controlling persons,
stockholders and similarly situated persons, harmless from and against all
Damages directly or indirectly, resulting from, relating to, arising out of
or attributable to any of the following: (i) any breach, violation or default
by Purchaser of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Purchaser in this
Agreement and (ii) any event arising from or relating to the ownership of the
Interests and the Properties.  
      
  10.3  |   | _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.  
   

   

(A) If any Action is threatened or commenced that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") by any party entitled to
indemnification 

   ##### 

  

   

under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any party
obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party (an " _Indemnitor_ "), then such
Indemnified Party will promptly give notice to the Indemnitor. Failure to
notify the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that
it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense
of such Action is materially and irrevocably prejudiced by the Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice. An Indemnitor may elect at any time to
assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the Indemnification Claim with
counsel of the Indemnitors choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor will not approve of the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to
the Indemnification Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Until an
Indemnitor assumes the defense of the Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Indemnification Claim in any manner the
Indemnified Party reasonably deems appropriate. If the Indemnified Party
gives an Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor
does not, within ten (10) days after such notice is given, give notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of
such Indemnification Claim and thereafter promptly assume such defense, then
the Indemnitor will be bound by any judicial determination made with respect
to such Indemnification Claim or any compromise or settlement of such
Indemnification Claim effected by the Indemnified Party. 

   

(B) A claim for any matter not involving a third party may be asserted by
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 

  

     10.4  |   | _Indemnification Despite Negligence_. _It is the
express intention of the Parties hereto that each party to be indemnified
pursuant to this Article X or other provision of this Agreement shall be
indemnified and held harmless from and against all Damages as to which
indemnity is provided for under this Article X or other
provision, notwithstanding that any such Damages arise out of or result from
the ordinary, strict, sole or contributory negligence of such Party and
regardless of whether any other party is or is not also negligent. The
Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing complies with the express
negligence rule and is conspicuous._  
---|---|--- 
      
  10.5  |   | _Limitations on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party
for any incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive, special or exemplary
Damages; _provided that_ any incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive,
or exemplary Damages recovered by a third party (including a Governmental
Authority, but excluding any Affiliate of any Party) against a party entitled
to indemnity pursuant to this Article X shall be included in the
Damages recoverable under such indemnity.

(2) By Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing has not occurred by the close of
business on August 15, 2006. 

   

(3) By Seller if any condition specified in Article VIII has not been
satisfied on or before the Closing Date, and shall not theretofore have been
waived by Seller;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to consummate
the Transaction on or before such date did not result from the failure by
Seller to fulfill any undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the
part of Seller that is required to be fulfilled on or prior to the Closing. 

   

(4) By Purchaser if any condition specified in Article IX has not been
satisfied on or before the Closing Date, and shall not theretofore have been
waived by Purchaser;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to consummate
the Transaction on or before such date did not result from the failure by
Purchaser to fulfill any undertaking or commitment provided for herein on the
part of Purchaser that is required to be fulfilled on or prior to the
Closing. 

   

(5) If, prior to the Closing Date, in performing its due diligence review
under Section 2.4, (i) Purchaser discovers one or more breaches of Sellers
or the Companies representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1
and 3.3, respectively, that would reduce the value of the Companies and
result in Damages to Purchaser that in the aggregate would exceed the Breach
Threshold Amount and (ii) Seller is unable to cure all or a portion of such
breaches prior to the Closing Date such that the aggregate value of the
breaches still exceed the Breach Threshold Amount; _provided, however_ , that
no such termination shall occur unless Purchaser notifies Seller of any such
breaches within five (5) business days prior to Closing and Seller is given a
reasonable opportunity to cure such breaches. 

   

(B) _Resolution of Disputes Regarding Termination_. If a dispute arises
between the Parties as to matters that Purchaser claims to be breaches
triggering the termination of the Agreement under Section 11.1(A)(5), the
provisions of Section 12.5(B)-(F) shall apply to resolve such dispute. 

   

(C) _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, pursuant to Section
11.1(A)(3) or 11.1(A)(4), written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by
the terminating Party or Parties to the other Party or Parties hereto, and
this Agreement shall thereupon terminate;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
following such termination Purchaser will continue to be bound by its
obligations set forth in Section 7.1 and each Party shall continue to be
subject to the terms of Sections 5.2 and 12.5. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein all filings, applications and other submissions
made to any Governmental Authority shall, to 

   ##### 

  

   

the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority to which
they were made. 

  

     11.2  |   | _Remedies_.  
---|---|--- 
   

   

(A) _Seller s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is not terminated by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 11.1(A) and Purchaser fails to satisfy on or prior to the Closing
Date the conditions to Closing set forth in any of Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
8.4 or 8.6 and such conditions are not waived by Seller, then Seller, at its
sole option, may (i) enforce specific performance of this Agreement or
(ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1(A)(3) and,
without waiving or releasing Purchasers obligations under Sections 5.2 and
7.1, retain the Performance Deposit. The retention of the Performance Deposit
by Seller upon a termination under Section 11.1(A)(3) shall in no way limit
any other remedies available to Seller at law or in equity as a
result of such termination. Without waiving or releasing Purchaser from any
of its other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, specific performance with respect to Section 8.3 shall not
require Purchaser to make a false statement in the officers certificate of
Purchaser. 

   

(B) _Purchaser s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the
contrary, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 11.1(A)(1) or
11.1(A)(2) or terminated by Purchaser in accordance with Sections 11.1(A)(4)
or 11.1(A)(5), Seller shall return the Performance Deposit within three (3)
business days following such termination. Except with respect to a
termination pursuant to Section 11.1(A)(4), such remedy shall be
Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for such termination, all other
remedies being expressly waived by Purchaser. Without waiving or releasing
Seller from any of its other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein, specific performance with respect to Section 9.3
shall not require Seller to make a false statement in the officers
certificate of Seller.

     12.5  |   | _Specific Performance; Dispute Resolution._   
---|---|--- 
   

   

(A) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be
irreparably damaged if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that the other Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce this Agreement and its terms and provisions in
any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the Parties in the matter, subject to Section
12.5(B) through (F) and Section 12.7, in addition to any other remedy to
which such Party may be entitled, at law or equity. 

   

(B) In the event of the existence of a dispute or disagreement arising out of,
or relating to, the formation, interpretation, performance or breach of the
Transaction Documents or any amendment thereto, a Party shall submit its
basis for such dispute or disagreement in writing to the other Parties and
the other Parties shall respond in writing to such written notice within 14
days after receiving the written notice. Thereafter, the Parties shall enter
into good faith negotiations in an attempt to resolve the dispute or
disagreement. All negotiations and written statements conducted or made
pursuant to this Section 12.5(B) are confidential and shall be treated as
compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the U.S. Federal Rules
of Evidence and state rules of evidence. If the Parties reach agreement
pertaining to any dispute pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Section 12.5(B), such agreement shall be reduced to writing, signed by all
Parties and shall be final and binding upon all Parties. 

   

(C) If any dispute shall not have been resolved through the use of the
procedures specified in Section 12.5(B) above 60 days after the initial
written submission of the issue by one Party to the other Parties, then the
dispute shall, unless the Parties otherwise 

   ##### 

  

    

agree, be submitted to and settled by arbitration in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, now in
effect, except to the extent modified herein. Unless the Parties shall
mutually agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing shall be held in Houston,
Texas. Further, unless the Parties shall mutually agree otherwise, the rules
of evidence of the State of Texas shall govern the discovery and presentation
of evidence for any arbitration hearing. Judgment on the award rendered may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall not
be empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages. 

   

(D) If, within 30 days after receipt of notice that a Party has referred a
dispute or disagreement to arbitration, the Parties shall select a sole
arbitrator to arbitrate the dispute (who will be neutral), provided that if
an agreement cannot be reached on an arbitrator within 30 days after the need
therefor, the said arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration
Association. Unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator, the Parties shall
bear their respective costs incurred in connection with the
procedures described in this Section 12.5, except that the Parties shall
share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator. The Parties shall
require the arbitrator to make a decision within 120 days after the
appointment of such arbitrator; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
time period shall be extended (but not beyond an additional 150 days) as
reasonably necessary to complete discovery so long as the Party or Parties
conducting such discovery are proceeding with reasonable diligence towards
completion thereof. 

   

(E) The procedures specified in this Section 12.5 shall be the sole and
exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes; _provided_ , _however_ ,
a Party, without prejudice to the mandatory procedures of this Section 12.5,
may file a complaint for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations, or
seek a preliminary injunction or other provisional judicial relief, if in its
sole judgment such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or
to preserve the status quo. Notwithstanding such action, the Parties will
continue to participate in good faith in the procedures specified in this
Section 12.5. 

   

(F) All applicable statutes of limitation and defenses based upon the passage
of time shall be tolled while the procedures specified in this Section 12.5
are pending. The Parties will take such action, if any, required to
effectuate such tolling. 

  

     12.6  |   | _Headings_. The article and section headings contained
in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and will not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  12.7  |   | _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving
effect to any choice of law principles.  
      
  12.8  |   | _Amendment; Extensions; Waivers_. Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver
is in writing and is signed, in the case of any amendment, by each Party to
this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. Each waiver of a right hereunder does not extend
beyond the specific event or circumstance giving rise to the right. No waiver
by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
covenant  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   | hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising because of
any prior or subsequent such occurrence. Neither the failure nor any delay on
the part of any Party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement
will operate as a waiver thereof, nor does any single or partial exercise of
any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of the same or of
any other right or remedy.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     12.9  |   | _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will
be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any provision of this Agreement, as
applied to any Party or to any circumstance, is judicially determined not to
be enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Parties agree that the court
judicially making such determination may modify the provision in a manner
consistent with its objectives such that it is enforceable, and/or to delete
specific words or phrases, and in its modified form, such provision will then
be enforceable and will be enforced.  
---|---|--- 
      
  12.10  |   | _DTPA_. To the extent applicable to the Transaction or any
portion thereof, Purchaser waives the provisions of the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices Act, Chapter 17, Subchapter E, Sections 17.41 through 17.63,
inclusive (other than Section 17.555, which is not waived), of the Texas
Business and Commerce Code. In connection with such waiver, Purchaser hereby
represents and warrants to Seller that Purchaser (i) is in the business
of seeking or acquiring by purchase or lease, goods, or services, for
commercial or business use, (ii) has assets of $5,000,000 or more according
to its most recent financial statement, (iii) has knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the merits and
risks of the Transaction and (iv) is not in a significantly disparate
bargaining position.  
      
  12.11  |   | _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction, including all fees and expenses of agents,
representatives, financial advisors, brokers, legal counsel
and accountants.  
      
  12.12  |   | _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement will become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other
Parties.  
      
  12.13  |   | _Construction_. This Agreement has been freely and fairly
negotiated among the Parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party because of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. The words "include," "includes," and "including" will be deemed to
be followed by "without limitation." The word "person" includes individuals,
entities and Governmental Authorities. Pronouns in masculine, feminine and
neuter genders will be construed to include any other gender, and words in
the singular form will be construed to include the plural and vice versa,
unless the context otherwise requires. The words   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

       |   | "this Agreement," "herein," "hereof," "hereby,"
"hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The
Parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein will have independent significance. If any Party has breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
which the Party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the
fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or
covenant.  
---|---|--- 
      
  12.14  |   | _Change of Name_. Seller will have the right to change the
name of each Company prior to Closing and, if it exercises this right, will
register the change of name with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. If
Seller does not exercise this right, Purchaser shall eliminate the use of
"Blacksand" in each Companys name promptly following Closing, either through
a merger of each Company into another Person, dissolution of each Company
or direct change of name, and shall provide Seller evidence of such
elimination. As promptly as practicable, but in any case no later than
December 31, 2006, Purchaser shall eliminate (and provide Seller evidence of
such elimination) the name "Blacksand" and any variants thereof from the
Properties and any activities in connection therewith and, except
with respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have
no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or
any of its Affiliates. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each Party will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction, including all fees and expenses of agents,
representatives, financial advisors, brokers, legal counsel and
accountants.  
      
  12.15  |   | _Schedules_. The Company has or may have set forth
information on a schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the
Section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a schedule need not be set forth in any other schedule so long as
its relevance to such other section of the schedule or section of the
Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed
therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the schedules to this Agreement may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Purchaser; (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that
the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that
the matter is material or would have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) the
disclosure by Seller of any matter in the schedules relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Law or Contract shall not be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.
