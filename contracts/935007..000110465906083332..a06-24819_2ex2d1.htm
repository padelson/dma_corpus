 **ARTICLE III 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

Section 3.1. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company or
its stockholders, the following shall occur.

  

Section 3.1.1. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1.2_, and any shares of Company Common
Stock that are held by stockholders exercising appraisal rights pursuant
to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ")) (and
for purposes hereof each share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
include the associated rights of the Company (the " _Company Rights_ ")
attributable to such share pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
February 6, 1997, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as Rights Agent, as amended (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ ")),
shall be converted, subject to _Section 3.2.4_, into the right to receive
Twenty Dollars ($20.00) in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such shares shall thereafter represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor; _provided, however,_ that
shares of the Company held by Dissenting Stockholders (" _Dissenting Shares_
") will be treated in accordance with _Section 3.3_, and shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1.2_ shall be treated as provided in _Section
3.1.2_. Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares or shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
3.1.2_ ) shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration, without interest,
upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 3.2_.

  

Section 3.1.2. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub,
any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

  

Section 3.1.3. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing

     

   

ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of
such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 3.1.4. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration, the Option Payments and
the Restricted Stock Payments shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares.

  

Section 3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

Section 3.2.1. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with StockTrans, Inc. or another bank or trust company designated
by Parent and satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, cash in U.S.
dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver out of the Exchange Fund the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_. The cash
included in the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided, however,_  that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders
of Company Common Stock and, following any losses, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of the shares of the Company Common Stock in the amount of any such losses,
and (ii) such investments shall be (a) in obligations of, or guaranteed by,
the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, (b) in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or (c) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available).
Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs. The cash in the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose.

  

Section 3.2.2. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and the
form of which shall be subject to the consent of the Company prior to the
Effective Time, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are held
in book-entry or

     

   

other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent
of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account statement (it being
understood that any references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to
include references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock)), the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  No interest will be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to
demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby as
contemplated by _Section 3.3_.

  

Section 3.2.3. All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (and each Company Right
associated therewith) in respect of which such payment is made.

  

Section 3.2.4. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

  

Section 3.2.5. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  

Section 3.2.6. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, without any interest
thereon.

  

Section 3.2.7. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts
as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent,

     

   

such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent.

  

Section 3.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Dissenting Stockholder shall demand to be
paid the "fair value" of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company
Common Stock, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company
Common Stock (which shall be deemed to include the Company Rights associated
with such shares) shall not be converted into or exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section
3.3_) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to payment of the
fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses the
right to dissent. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal,
and any other instrument served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received
by the Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demand for payment of the fair value of a
Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock prior to the
Effective Time. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively
withdrawn (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or lost the right
to dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Dissenting
Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 3.1_.

  

Section 3.4. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the
exchange of Certificates described in _Section 3.2.2_) and thereafter, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except
as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason
shall represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof as provided herein.

  

Section 3.5. _Company Equity Awards_.

  

Section 3.5.1.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate, any committee thereof) (the " _Company Board_ ") shall adopt
appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate
to provide that, concurrent with the Effective Time:

  

(i) each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ ") granted pursuant to the equity
compensation plans set forth in _Schedule 3.5.1(a)_ of the Company

     

   

Disclosure Schedule, whether or not then exercisable, conditioned or vested,
and irrespective of the exercise price per share thereof, shall fully vest
and be deemed to be exercised in full and cancelled and each holder of a
Company Option shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in
consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such Company Option,
a cash payment (such consideration being the " _Option Payments_ ") in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of the per share Merger
Consideration, less the applicable exercise price per share of such Company
Option, and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option (determined on the basis that such Company Option is
fully vested and currently exercisable), without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld; and

  

(ii) each outstanding and unvested restricted stock award granted by the
Company (" _Company Restricted Stock Awards_ ") pursuant to the equity
compensation plans set forth in _Schedule 3.5.1(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, whether or not then conditioned, shall be deemed to be
fully vested and cancelled and each holder of a Company Restricted Stock
Award shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in consideration of
the deemed cancellation of such Company Restricted Stock Award, a cash
payment (such consideration being the " _Restricted Stock Payments_ ") equal
to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the amount of the per share Merger Consideration;
_provided, however,_ that the Restricted Stock Payments shall be paid
without interest and shall be subject to any applicable withholding or other
Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld.

  

Concurrent with the Effective Time, each Company Option and each Company
Restricted Stock Award shall be canceled and terminated and shall only
entitle the Person who previously held the same to payment of the Option
Payment and/or Restricted Stock Payment, as the case may be, payable to such
Person as described in this _Section 3.5.1_. At the Closing, Parent shall take
all steps necessary to ensure that the Surviving Corporation or the Company
makes all Option Payments and Restricted Stock Payments to the respective
Persons entitled thereto in accordance with this _Section 3.5.1_. Each Option
Payment and each Restricted Stock Payment pursuant to this _Section
3.5.1(a)_ shall be made by check, dated the Closing Date, (i) made payable to
the respective Person entitled thereto, and (ii) delivered to such Person by
hand, or mailed via overnight courier to such Person, on the Closing Date.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments pursuant to _Section 3.5.1(a)_ to
Persons listed on _Schedule 3.5.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be subject to Section 6 of their respective Executive Agreements
relating to certain tax matters.

  

(c) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company has made available to Parent a schedule stating the name of the
holder of each Company Option and each Company Restricted Stock Award, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option
and Company Restricted

     

   

Stock Award, and the exercise price of each such Company Option, in each case
as of November 30, 2006. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall update such schedule as necessary so that it
will be accurate as of the Closing Date. Such updated schedule shall also
reflect (i) the amount of the Option Payment to be made pursuant to this
_Section 3.5.1_  to each holder of a Company Option, (ii) the amount of the
Restricted Stock Payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.5.1_ to each
holder of a Company Restricted Stock Award, and (iii) the mailing address of
each such holder of a Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Award.

  

Section 3.5.2. The provisions of this _Section 3.5_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each holder of any Company Options or Company
Restricted Stock Awards, and their respective heirs, beneficiaries and
representatives.

the Company Disclosure Schedule that specifically references or cross-

Section 6.4. _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  

Section 6.4.1. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.4_, the

the Company Subsidiaries to, and enter into negotiations or discussions with,
the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its officers, directors,
partners, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors,
agents and other representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less favorable in any material respect to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (exclusive of any standstill provisions contained
therein). Parent and Merger Sub agree and acknowledge that, with respect to
any agreement between the Company and any Third Party that contains a
provision prohibiting such Third Party from making a Takeover Proposal
without first obtaining from the Company Board a waiver of such provision or

this clause (ii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),
and/or (iii) subject to _Section 6.4.3_, enter into an agreement regarding
a Superior Proposal, if (x) in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above,
the Company Board has determined in good faith that the failure to take such

eight (48) hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of the
Companys receipt of any Takeover

     

   

Proposal or any request for information in connection with a possible
Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal or request, but not the identity of the Person making such Takeover
Proposal. In addition, the Company shall not accept or enter into any
agreement, letter of intent or similar document (other than a confidentiality

for a period of not less than three (3) Business Days after Parents receipt
of notice concerning a Takeover Proposal, and during such three (3) Business
Day period, at Parents request, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in
good faith. If, prior to the conclusion of such three (3) Business Day

Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease, sell or
otherwise dispose of any assets or business (including the requirement that

authorize Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiaries of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to operate or to continue to

currently operated. Within thirty (30) days following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall submit to the applicable Governmental Entities all
applications or other materials, if any, required to obtain such Government
Consents, including payment of all appropriate fees related thereto. Parent
shall promptly respond to any request by any relevant Governmental Entity for

time periods required under applicable Law for notice, licensure or other
similar regulatory requirement in connection with receipt of Government
Consents as described in this _Section 6.5.2_. Parent shall pay all fees and
expenses required in connection with the matters described in this _Section
6.5.2_. Parent shall keep the Company fully apprised at all times concerning
the matters described in this _Section 6.5.2_.

  

Section 6.5.3. The Company and Parent shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other
on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental Entity in

Business Days to any filings or written materials furnished to such Party for
its review, such Party shall be deemed to have approved such filing or
written material.

  

Section 6.5.4. Each Party shall promptly inform the others of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and keep the others informed of the status of
the proceedings related to obtaining any approvals of any Governmental Entity

any waiting period). Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the others in advance of any meeting or conference with a
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a Third Party,
with any other Person, relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and, to the extent permitted by such applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other Parties the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. If any Party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from
any such Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the transactions
provided for in this Agreement, then such Party shall endeavor in good faith
to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request.

  

Section 6.6. _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties

cause any condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger and
the other transactions provided for in this Agreement not to be satisfied or
(ii) the failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it

     

   

pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of any Party to effect the Merger and the other
transactions provided for in this Agreement not to be satisfied.

case of Parent, Parent shall cause each Parent Subsidiary and each Parent
Representative, if applicable, and in the case of the Company, the Company
shall cause each Company Subsidiary and each Company Representative, if

concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of (i) the Company, in the event the
disclosing Party is Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary or any Parent
Representative, or (ii) Parent, in the event the disclosing Party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however,_ that if a
Party determines, based upon advice of counsel, that disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law (including any Laws relating to the filing
obligations of the respective Parties under _Section 6.5.2_) or the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange or market or trading system upon which the
securities of such Party is listed, such Party may make such disclosure to

the Company Disclosure Schedule) with respect to Company Benefit Plans that
the Company will implement, effective concurrent with the Effective Time,
including acceleration of vesting, partial or full funding, amendment,
termination or other similar actions.

  

Section 6.8.2. Parent hereby agrees that following the Effective Time, it
shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
(i) provide each Continuing Employee with a substantially similar position at
a substantially similar salary and wages and on substantially the same terms
and conditions as was provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) allow each Continuing Employee employed by
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to
participate in either (A) all Surviving Corporation Benefit Plans (except to
the extent any such plan provides equity based compensation) that apply at
that time to all or substantially all other employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries or (B) Company Benefit Plans (except to the extent any such plan
provides equity based compensation) in which such Company Employee
participates immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Nothing herein shall
be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Continuing Employee or to
restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
terminate any Continuing Employee.

  

Section 6.8.3. Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, and
eligibility to receive benefits) under any Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan
under which any Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or
after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the

     

   

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under comparable Company Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_  that
such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit.

  

Section 6.8.4. With respect to any Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan that is
a welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement (a " _Parent Welfare Benefit
Plan_ ") and in which any Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide credit to each Continuing
Employee (and his/her spouse, dependents and beneficiaries) for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing
Employee (and his/her spouse, dependents and beneficiaries) under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan during the relevant plan year, up to and
including the Effective Time.

  

Section 6.8.5. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
terms, (i) all change in control, severance, retention and employment
agreements or arrangements (including an employees right to terminate
employment for "Good Reason"), in each case with the current and former
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as set forth in
_Schedule 6.8.5(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) the
severance arrangements set forth on _Schedule 6.1(k)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  

Section 6.8.6. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make available
all background checks conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and
the Company shall cause all Company Subsidiaries to conduct background checks
on employees hired by them after the date hereof, in accordance with the
currently existing employment practices of the Company and the respective
Company Subsidiaries.

  

Section 6.8.7. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company a complete list of all
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries whose employment Parent
desires to be terminated by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary,
as the case may be, at or prior to the Effective Time. The employment of
each such listed employee shall be terminated by the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary effective on or before the Closing Date and at
or prior to the Effective Time, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, jointly and severally, shall pay or cause to be paid to each
such terminated employee as and when due the reduction in force severance
benefits payable to him or her pursuant to the severance policy of the
Company in effect on the date hereof (a copy of which has been made available
to Parent on or prior to the date hereof) (the " _Severance Policy_ ") as a
result of such termination. With respect to all Continuing Employees whose
employment is not terminated on or before the Closing Date pursuant to the
preceding provisions of this _Section 6.8.7_  but whose employment by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is terminated not later than
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with its
terms and for the benefit of all such Continuing Employees, the Severance
Policy.

     

   

Section 6.9. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

Section 6.9.1. From and after the Effective Time until six (6) years from the
Effective Time, unless otherwise required by Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the comparable
organizational documents of its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to the elimination of liability of directors and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors, officers,
employees and agents than are set forth in the Company Certificate and the
Company Bylaws (or the equivalent documents of the relevant Company
Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however,_ that in the
event any claim or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the
protections of such provisions within such six (6) year period, such
provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition of any such
claims. During the period when any of such provisions referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence are required to be maintained in effect as
stated in such sentence, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, promise to cause the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation to honor and perform each such provision in
accordance with its terms.

  

Section 6.9.2. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance (the " _D andO
Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the DandO Insurance
(a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore made available to
Parent), on terms with respect to the coverage, deductible and amounts no
less favorable than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that (i) in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 6.9.2_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the annual amount
currently paid by the Company, it being understood and agreed that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide the
maximum amount of such coverage as may be obtained for such annual 200%
amount and (ii) in the event of the application of clause (i), any present or
former officer or director, upon reasonable written notice thereof (which
notice shall be provided no later than twenty (20) days prior to the
Effective Time and shall set forth in reasonable detail for each Person to be
covered the policy coverage, premiums, deductibles, limitations and other
pertinent information), who desires to obtain additional coverage such that,
when combined with the coverage obtained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with clause (i), it provides insurance coverage
equivalent to the DandO Insurance in effect on the date hereof, may so elect
and Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to acquire such
additional coverage on behalf of such Person; _provided, further,_ that in the
event any present or former officer or director makes such an election, such
present or former officer or director shall pay the portion of the premium of
such DandO Insurance in excess of the amount that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation is obligated to pay pursuant to this _Section 6.9.2_.  The
insurance purchased pursuant to this _Section 6.9.2_ shall be prepaid in
full at the Effective Time and shall be non-cancelable. At the request of the
Company, Parent shall arrange for such insurance prior to the Effective Time
to be effective only at and after the Effective Time; _provided,_
that Parent shall pay in full for such insurance coverage no later than
the Effective Time. At Parents election, the Company may acquire a six (6)
year tail policy for Persons currently covered by DandO Insurance that is
consistent with the first sentence of this  _Section 6.9.2_. Such
policy, if acquired by the Company, shall be prepaid at the Effective Time
and shall be non-cancelable. If

     

   

the Company acquires such a tail policy, Parents obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 6.9.2_ shall be deemed completely satisfied.
The obligation to maintain insurance provided in this _Section 6.9.2_ shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time; _provided,_ that in the event any claim
or claims are asserted or made within such six year period, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall ensure that such insurance remains in full force
and effect with respect to such claims until final disposition thereof.

  

Section 6.9.3. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (or acquirer of such assets), as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

  

Section 6.9.4. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.9_
shall be in addition to any right such Person might have under the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation or the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any comparable organizational
documents of their Subsidiaries, or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.

  

Section 6.9.5. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and representatives.

  

Section 6.10. _State Takeover Statutes_. Parent, the Company and their
respective Boards of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary
to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions provided for in
this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
transactions provided for in this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  

Section 6.11. _Company Rights Agreement_. The Company covenants and agrees
that, concurrently with or promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, it will take all necessary action (including, if required,
redeeming all of the outstanding Company Rights or amending or terminating
the Company Rights Agreement) (i) to render the Company Rights Agreement
inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) to ensure that no Person is able to exercise
any Company Rights under the Company Rights Agreement or enable or require
the Company Rights to be separated from the shares of Company Common Stock to
which they are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable, in each
case as a result of the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

     

   

Section 6.12. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock) by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
_Section 16(a)_ of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

Section 6.13. _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until
the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the expiration of the
Confidentiality Agreement according to its terms.

  

Section 6.14. _Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub; No Other
Representations or Warranties_.

  

Section 6.14.1. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it
has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has
formed an independent judgment concerning, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Sub
have requested such documents and information from the Company as each such
Party considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In
connection with Parents and Merger Subs investigation of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Parent Representatives have received from the Company or the
Company Representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget
information. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; that Parent and Merger Sub are familiar with
such uncertainties; and that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to
them or their representatives.

  

Section 6.14.2. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the Company has not made and shall not be deemed to
have made to Parent, Merger Sub or any of the Parent Representatives any
representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that neither the Company,
any holder of the Companys securities nor any of their respective Affiliates
or Company Representatives, makes or has made any representation or warranty
to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives or Affiliates with
respect to:

  

(i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered
to

     

   

or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Representatives or
Affiliates; or

  

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Representatives or Affiliates with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made by the Company and contained in this

6.4.3_  of this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in
_Section 7.2.2_  would not be satisfied and, with respect to a material
breach of _Section 6.2.3_ , such breach is incapable of being cured prior to
the expiration of ten (10) calendar days after the Company receives written
notice of such breach from Parent; _provided, however,_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ shall not be
available to Parent if it or Merger Sub is in material breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

     

   

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 8.2_, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers or
directors; _provided, however,_ that (i) the provisions of _Sections
8.2, 8.3, 8.4_, and _8.5_ and _Article IX_ and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) the Termination Fee shall be the exclusive remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub under circumstances where the Termination Fee
is payable by the Company; _provided, further,_  that no Party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement and, in such
event, the non-breaching Party or Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery
for any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, demands, charges,
penalties, costs, expenses and/or diminution in value of such Party or
Parties. In no event shall any Party be liable for punitive damages.

  

Section 8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of
Parent and the Company shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement (including any SEC filing fees).

  

Section 8.4. _Termination Fee_.

  

Section 8.4.1. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(c)(iii)(x)_, _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section
8.1(d)(iii)_ and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material breach of this
Agreement at the time of such termination, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent $10,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), which
amount shall be inclusive of all Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub, not later
than the day of such termination. The Termination Fee shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
to the Company by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay, or cause to paid, the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.

  

Section 8.4.2. The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 8.4.1_ are reasonable forecasts of the actual damages that may be
incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee, and,
in order to obtain such payments Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay
to Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit.

  

Section 8.5. _Specific Performance_. The Parties recognize that in the event
Parent or Merger Sub should refuse to perform under the provisions of this
Agreement, monetary damages alone will not be adequate. The Company shall
therefore be entitled, in addition to any other

     

   

remedies that may be available, including money damages, to obtain specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any action to
enforce this Agreement specifically, Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

  

Section 8.6. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, subject to
_Section 8.7_, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided, however,_  that after
the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be any extension or
waiver of this Agreement that decreases the Merger Consideration or that
adversely affects the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock hereunder
without the approval of the holders of Company Common Stock. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party.  The
failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

  

Section 8.7. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties but
only by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that,
after the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made
without further approval of the holders of Company Common Stock that, by Law
or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange or market or
trading system, requires further approval by the holders of Company Common
Stock. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by the Parties.

  

 **ARTICLE IX 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

Section 9.1. _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, and
after the Effective Time no claim, action, suit or proceeding may be asserted
or brought based on or relating to any such representation or warranty or any
breach or alleged breach thereof. This _Article IX_ , the agreements of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in _Section 3.5_ ( _Company Equity
Awards_ ), _Section 6.8_ ( _Employee Matters_ ), _Section 6.9_ (
_Indemnification of Directors and Officers_ ), and _Section 8.3_ ( _Fees and
Expenses_ ) and those other covenants and agreements contained herein that by
their terms apply, or that are to be performed in whole or in part, after the
Effective Time shall survive the consummation of the Merger.

  

Section 9.2. _Notices_. Any notices or other communications required or
permitted under, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person
or upon confirmation of receipt when transmitted by facsimile transmission or

Section 9.3. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.4. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as

     

   

possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

  

Section 9.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

Section 9.6. _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_  that (i) the
provisions of _Section 3.5_, _Section 6.8_ and _Section 6.9_ shall inure
to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Persons described in such
Sections; and (ii) the stockholders of the Company shall be third party
beneficiaries of _Article III_ of this Agreement and shall have the right to
enforce such provisions, including the right to seek and recover any and all
damages that the stockholders of the Company may incur or suffer as a result
of a breach of such provisions.

  

Section 9.7. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be
null and void. No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

  

Section 9.8. _Mutual Drafting_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties.

  

Section 9.9. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

Section 9.9.1. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any Law
other than the Laws of the State of Delaware.

  

Section 9.9.2. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought solely in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware; _provided,_
that if (and only after) such courts determine that they lack subject matter
jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding, such legal
action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the Federal courts of the
United States located in the State of Delaware; _provided, further,_  that
if (and only after) both the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States located in the State of
Delaware determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such
legal action, suit or proceeding, such legal action, suit or proceeding shall
be brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts in respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this

     

   

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action, suit or proceeding,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such
courts, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the service of process in
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to thisAgreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 9.2_.

  

Section 9.10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The delivery by or on
behalf of any Party of its signature to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission, electronic mail or similar means shall for all
purposes be the equivalent of the delivery of the original signature of such
Party.
