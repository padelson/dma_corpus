<PAGE>

          (c)  Sellers  or  Purchaser,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  pay  the

     determined by the Bankruptcy  Court in the preceding  calendar  quarter and
     the portion thereof  constituting  Rejection Claims and receipt of evidence
     reasonably   satisfactory  to  Purchaser   verifying  such   certification,
     Purchaser  shall pay to Sellers by wire transfer of  immediately  available
     funds to an account  designated  in  writing  by Sellers an amount,  to the
     extent not previously paid, equal to the product of (i) $0.27 and (ii)  the

     this clause (d) shall not exceed $64.8 million.

     Section 2.6. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

          (a) As soon as reasonably practical after the Closing, but in no event
     more than one hundred  twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,  Purchaser
     shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a report setting forth the calculation
     of each of the  Adjustments  and the  amount  payable  in  accordance  with
     Section 2.7 (the  "Adjustment  Report").  The  Adjustment  Report  shall be
     prepared  in  accordance   with  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  and  GAAP
     Consistency,  and in the event of an  inconsistency  between  the two,  the
     terms of this Agreement shall govern.  Sellers shall provide Purchaser with
     reasonable access to their books, records and facilities in connection with
     Purchaser's preparation of the Adjustment Report.

          (b) Within  twenty (20) days after receipt of the  Adjustment  Report,
     Sellers  may,  by written  notice to  Purchaser,  object to the  Adjustment
     Report. Upon reasonable prior notice,  Purchaser shall provide Sellers with
     reasonable  access during normal business hours during such twenty (20) day
     period  to the  books  and  records  used in  connection  with  Purchaser's
     preparation of the Adjustment  Report.  If Sellers object to the Adjustment
     Report,  they shall  within  such twenty  (20) day period  deliver  written
     notice  of  their   objection  (the   "Objection   Notice")  to  Purchaser:
     (i) objecting  to  the  Adjustment   Report  and  the  calculation  of  the
     Adjustments,  (ii) setting  forth the items being  disputed and the reasons
     therefor,  and  (iii) specifying   Sellers'  calculation  of  each  of  the
     Adjustments and the amount payable in accordance with Section 2.7.

          (c) For  fifteen  (15) days after  delivery of the  Objection  Notice,
     Purchaser and Sellers  shall  attempt to resolve all disputes  between them
     regarding the  Adjustment  Report.  If Purchaser and Sellers cannot resolve
     all such disputes within such fifteen (15) day period, Genuity or Purchaser
     may submit the  matters in dispute for  determination  by Deloitte & Touche
     LLP or another  nationally  recognized  independent  public accounting firm
     mutually  satisfactory to Purchaser and Sellers (the "Arbiter").  Promptly,
     but  not  later  than  thirty  (30)  days  after  the   acceptance  of  its
     appointment,  the Arbiter shall determine (based solely on presentations to
     the Arbiter by or on behalf of Sellers and Purchaser and not by independent
     review)  only those  items in dispute  and shall  render a report as to the
     calculation of each of the Adjustments and the resulting
<PAGE>

     payment pursuant to Section 2.7. For purposes of the Arbiter's  calculation
     of the Purchase Price,  the amounts to be included shall be the appropriate
     amounts from the Adjustment  Report as to items that are not in dispute and
     for those  items in dispute  the  amounts  determined  by the  Arbiter.  In
     resolving  any  disputed  item,  the Arbiter may not assign a value to such
     item greater than the greatest  value for such item claimed by either party
     or less  than the  lowest  value  for such item  claimed  by either  party.
     Purchaser  and  Sellers  shall  cooperate  with the  Arbiter  in making its
     determination and such  determination  shall be conclusive and binding upon
     Purchaser and Sellers.

          (d)  Purchaser  and Genuity  shall each bear  one-half of the fees and
     expenses of the Arbiter.

      Section 2.7. Payment of the Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

          (a)  Payment  due as a  result  of any  Adjustment  shall  be  made as
     provided in this Section  2.7.  Any payment due to Purchaser  shall be paid
     directly by Sellers and shall not reduce the Escrowed Funds.

          (b) If the Adjustment  provided for in this Article II  results (i) in
     an  increase  to the Base  Price,  Purchaser  shall pay the  Adjustment  to
     Sellers,  or (ii) in a decrease  to the Base Price,  Sellers  shall pay the
     Adjustment to Purchaser, in each case together with interest at the rate of
     5% per annum from the Closing Date through the date such payment is made.

          (c) Any  payment  pursuant  to this  Section  2.7 shall be paid within
     twenty (20) days after delivery of the Adjustment Report;  provided that if
     an Objection  Notice  shall have been timely  delivered  but the  Objection
     Notice, if resolved in favor of the party required to make payment pursuant
     to this Section 2.7, would result only in a reduction in the amount owed to
     the other party pursuant to this Section 2.7, then,  pending  resolution of
     such Objection Notice,  the party required to make payment pursuant to this
     Section 2.7 shall pay the lower of the two amounts  calculated by Purchaser
     and Sellers  within ten  (10) days  after the  delivery  of such  Objection
     Notice, together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum from the Closing
     Date  through  the date  such  payment  is made.  Any  amounts  owed  after
     resolution  of all  disputes  by the  Arbiter  shall  be paid to the  party
     entitled to receipt  thereof  within ten (10) days of the  Arbiter's  final
     determination,  together with interest at the rate of 5% per annum from the
     Closing Date through the date such payment is made.

          (d) Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code  Section 364(c)(1),  the obligation of
     Sellers to pay the  Adjustments,  including  interest with respect thereto,
     shall  receive  superpriority  administrative  claim  status.  Pursuant  to
     Bankruptcy Code Section 364(c)(1),  the administrative claims in respect of
     the  Adjustments,  including  interest  with  respect  thereto,  shall have
     priority over any and all administrative expenses of the kinds specified in
     Bankruptcy Code Sections 503(b), 506(c), 507(a) or 507(b).

     Section 2.8. Selection of Customer Contracts for Assignment.

          (a) Not  more  than  two (2)  Business  Days  after  the  date of this
     Agreement,  Sellers shall  deliver to Purchaser a schedule  (the  "Customer
     Contract  Schedule") setting forth a list of all of Sellers' Contracts with
     their   customers  as  of  the  date  of  this   Agreement  (the  "Customer
     Contracts"),  and a description  of the name of the customer,  the relevant
     Seller and the date of the Contract, which Customer Contract Schedule shall
     designate which of the Customer  Contracts is a Foreign Customer  Contract.
     Customer  Contracts  shall also  include  any  Contract  of a Seller with a
     customer  entered  into during the period from the date hereof  through the
     commencement of the Bankruptcy Case.  Sellers shall identify such Contracts
     to Purchaser in writing within five (5) days after the  commencement of the
     Bankruptcy Case and the Customer  Contract Schedule shall be deemed thereby
     amended  without any further action  required by any party hereto.  Sellers
     shall  either  promptly  deliver  a  copy  of  each  Customer  Contract  to
     Purchaser, or provide Purchaser with access to Sellers' electronic database
     containing the full and complete text of such Customer Contract.

          (b) With respect to each Customer Contract,  Purchaser may, by written
     notice  to  Genuity,   delivered  no  later  than  the  later  of  (i) five
     (5) Business  Days prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) twenty (20) Business
     Days subsequent to the date that such Customer Contract is included,  added
     or  deemed  added  to the  Customer  Contract  Schedule  and a copy  of the
     Customer  Contract is delivered or made available to Purchaser  (such later
     date being referred to as the "Customer  Contract  Election Date") instruct
     Sellers  whether  or not to assume and assign to  Purchaser  such  Customer
     Contract  (each Foreign  Customer  Contract other than those that Purchaser
     has timely instructed  Sellers to assume,  and each North American Customer
     Contract that  Purchaser has timely  instructed  Sellers not to assume,  is
     referred  to as an  "Excluded  Customer  Contract").  After  each  Customer
     Contract Election Date, the corresponding Customer Contracts other than the
     Excluded  Customer  Contracts  are  referred  to as the  "Assumed  Customer
     Contracts."

          (c) On the Customer  Contract  Election Date (or with respect to those
     Customer  Contracts which have a Customer  Contract  Election Date prior to
     the Closing Date, on the Closing Date),  Sellers shall (i) cure any and all
     defaults  existing  under  each  Assumed  Customer  Contract  to the extent
     required  for  Sellers to assume  such  Assumed  Customer  Contract  in the
     Bankruptcy  Case,  (ii) pay,  or to the extent  permitted by the Sale Order
     segregate  funds  sufficient  to pay,  any and all  Cure  Amounts  due with
     respect  to such  Assumed  Customer  Contract,  (iii) assume  such  Assumed
     Customer  Contract in the Bankruptcy  Case, and  (iv) subject  to Purchaser
     providing adequate assurance of performance to the counterparty  thereto to
     the extent required by the Bankruptcy  Court,  assign such Assumed Customer
     Contract to Purchaser  pursuant to an Order of the Bankruptcy  Court (which
     may  be  the  Sale  Order).  Effective  upon  and  concurrently  with  such
     assignment,  Purchaser shall assume each Assumed Customer Contract assigned
     to it pursuant to this Section 2.8.

          (d) Sellers  shall  promptly  notify  Purchaser  in writing of any new
     Contract  with a  customer  entered  into  after  the  commencement  of the
     Bankruptcy  Case.  No later
<PAGE>

     than the later of (i) five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and
     (ii)  five (5)  Business  Days  subsequent  to the date that a copy of such
     Contract is  delivered  or made  available to  Purchaser,  Purchaser  shall
     notify  Sellers  in writing  whether it will  assume  such  Contract.  With
     respect to those  Customer  Contracts that  Purchaser  expressly  elects to
     assume,  Sellers  shall assign such  Contracts to Purchaser by the later of
     (x) the  Closing  Date,  and (y) two (2)  Business  Days after  notice from
     Purchaser,  and effective upon such assignment  Purchaser shall assume such
     Contract.  If  Purchaser  has  issued a  Section  5.1  Consent  to a Seller
     entering into a new Contract with a customer,  Purchaser shall be deemed to
     have  expressly  elected to, and  Purchaser  shall assume such new Contract
     pursuant to this Section 2.8(d).

          (e) With  respect to each  Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract,
     Purchaser  may, by written  notice to Genuity,  delivered no later than the
     later  of  (i) five  (5) Business  Days  prior  to the  Closing  Date,  and
     (ii) twenty  (20) Business  Days  subsequent to the date that a copy of the
     Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer Contract is delivered or made available to
     Purchaser  request that Sellers cause the  Non-Seller  Subsidiary  party to
     such  Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract to assign such  Non-Seller
     Subsidiary  Customer Contract to a Seller.  Upon receipt of such a request,
     Sellers  shall  use  their  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to cause the
     Non-Seller Subsidiary that is a party to the Non-Seller Subsidiary Customer
     Contract to assign such Non-Seller Subsidiary Customer Contract to a Seller
     (but only if and to the extent such assignment is permitted under the terms
     of such Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract and all applicable Legal
     Requirements  and only if such assignment would not, in Sellers' good faith
     judgment,  present  any  significant  risk to any  Seller,  the  Non-Seller
     Subsidiary or any of their respective  Affiliates,  including  directors or
     officers,  of any legal or financial  liability),  provided,  however, that
     Sellers shall not be obligated to offer or pay any  consideration  or grant
     any financial  accommodation in connection therewith to the counterparty to
     such  Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract.  If  and  to  the  extent
     permitted under the terms of the Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract
     and  all  applicable  Legal  Requirements,  if  the  Non-Seller  Subsidiary
     Customer  Contract has been  assigned to a Seller  pursuant to this Section
     2.8(c), such Seller will assign the Non-Seller Subsidiary Customer Contract
     to  Purchaser  by  the  later  of  (x) five (5)  Business  Days  after  the
     assignment of the Non-Seller  Subsidiary  Customer  Contract to such Seller
     and (y) the  Closing  Date,  provided,  however,  that Sellers shall not be
     obligated  to  offer  or pay  any  consideration  or  grant  any  financial
     accommodation   in  connection   therewith  to  the  counterparty  to  such
     Non-Seller  Subsidiary Customer Contract.  Effective upon the later of such
     assignment and Closing,  Purchaser  shall assume the Non-Seller  Subsidiary
     Customer Contract.

     Section 2.9. Selection of Other Contracts and Leases for Assignment.

          (a) At any  time and  from  time to time on or  prior to the  Election
     Date, Purchaser may, in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion by
     written  notice to Genuity on or before the  Election  Date,  elect to have
     Sellers assume and assign to it (i) one or more Undesignated Agreements and
     (ii) one or more Underlying  Service  Agreements.  Sellers shall (x) within
     two (2)  Business Days of any such notice,  provide  written  notice to the
     counterparties  to  the  Undesignated   Agreements  or  Underlying  Service
     Agreements  specified in Purchaser's  notice,  and (y) take such action, in
     each case
<PAGE>

     as is necessary  pursuant to the  procedures set forth in the Sale Order to
     assume such Undesignated Agreements and Underlying Service Agreements.

          (b) On the  date an  assumption  and  assignment  of any  Undesignated
     Agreement or Underlying  Service  Agreement  pursuant to Section  2.9(a) is
     scheduled  to become  effective  pursuant  to the  terms of the Sale  Order
     (provided  that if such  date is prior  to the  Closing  Date,  then on the
     Closing Date),  Sellers shall (i) cure any and all defaults  existing under
     each such  Assumed  Contract or Assumed  Lease to the extent  required  for
     Sellers to assume such Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease in the Bankruptcy
     Case,  (ii) pay,  or, to the extent permitted by the Sale Order,  segregate
     funds  sufficient to pay, any and all Cure Amounts due with respect to such
     Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease,  (iii) assume  such Assumed Contract or
     Assumed  Lease  in the  Bankruptcy  Case,  and  (iv) subject  to  Purchaser
     providing adequate assurance of performance to the counterparty  thereto to
     the extent required by the Bankruptcy  Court,  assign such Assumed Contract
     or Assumed Lease to Purchaser  pursuant to an Order of the Bankruptcy Court
     (which may be the Sale Order).  Effective upon such  assignment,  Purchaser
     shall assume each Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease assigned to it pursuant
     to this Section 2.9, and concurrently with such assumption, Purchaser shall
     reimburse  Sellers for any Purchaser Cure Amount due in connection with the
     assumption by Sellers of such Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease (or to the
     extent the Purchaser Cure Amount is in dispute,  Purchaser  shall segregate
     funds in escrow on terms  reasonably  acceptable  to Sellers  sufficient to
     reimburse  Sellers for the amount  claimed by them and  Purchaser  shall so
     reimburse   Sellers  promptly  upon  settlement  or  determination  by  the
     Bankruptcy Court of such dispute).

          (c) Purchaser  shall make  sufficient  elections to permit  Sellers to
     assume in the Bankruptcy  Case and assign to it pursuant to an Order of the
     Bankruptcy Court (which may be the Sale Order),  and Purchaser shall accept
     such  assignments  to it, of such  Contracts  and  Leases so that the total
     Rejection Claims shall not exceed $600 million.

          (d) Sellers  shall  promptly  notify  Purchaser  in writing of any new
     Contract  (other than a Contract  with a customer)  or Lease  entered  into
     after the  commencement of the Bankruptcy  Case. No later than the later of
     (i) five (5)  Business  Days prior to the Closing  Date,  and (ii) five (5)
     Business Days  subsequent to the date that a copy of such Contract or Lease
     is delivered or made available to Purchaser, Purchaser shall notify Sellers
     in writing  whether it will assume such Contract or Lease.  With respect to
     such new  Contract or Leases  that  Purchaser  expressly  elects to assume,
     Sellers shall assign such Contract or Leases to Purchaser, and concurrently
     with such assignment Purchaser shall assume such Contract or Lease.

     Section  2.10.  Assumption of Assumed  Contracts and Assumed  Leases on the
Closing Date.

     With  respect to each  Assumed  Contract  listed on  Schedule 1.1  and each
Assumed  Lease  listed on  Schedule 1.2,  on the  Closing  Date,  Sellers  shall

Assumed Lease to the extent required for Sellers to assume such Assumed Contract

by the Sale Order,  segregate funds  sufficient to pay, any and all Cure Amounts
due with respect to such Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease,  (iii) assume  such
<PAGE>

Assumed  Contract or Assumed Lease in the Bankruptcy  Case, and  (iv) subject to
Purchaser  providing  adequate  assurance  of  performance  to the  counterparty
thereto to the extent  required by the  Bankruptcy  Court,  assign such  Assumed
Contract or Assumed  Lease to Purchaser  pursuant to an Order of the  Bankruptcy
Court (which may be the Sale Order).  Effective on the Closing  Date,  Purchaser
shall assume each such Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease.

such notice,  such Undesignated  Agreement or Underlying Service Agreement shall
automatically be deemed to be an Excluded  Agreement.  At any time after fifteen
(15)  Business  Days prior to the Closing  Date and on or prior to the  Election

          (i) in respect  of  Undesignated  Agreements  and  Underlying  Service
     Agreements for which an election has been made pursuant to Section 2.9, the
     Assumption Date;

          (ii) in respect of  Undesignated  Agreements  and  Underlying  Service
     Agreements for which an election has been made pursuant to Section 2.11(a),
     the date set forth in such  election  (as such date may be  accelerated  in
     accordance with Section 2.11(a)); and

          (iii) in respect of  Undesignated  Agreements and  Underlying  Service
     Agreements  for which no election has been made  pursuant to Section 2.9 or
     Section 2.11(a), the Election Date.

     (c)  Purchaser  shall have the right to  reasonably  direct  Sellers in the
defense of, and in the settlement and compromise of, any claim in the Bankruptcy
Case  arising  out of an  Excluded  Agreement  if such claim  could give rise to
Rejection  Claims,  or at Sellers'  expense,  to initiate  and/or  prosecute any
objection to any claim  arising from any

<PAGE>

Excluded  Agreement if such claim could give rise to Rejection  Claims.  Sellers
shall not settle any claim in the  Bankruptcy  Case  arising out of any Excluded
Agreement if such claim could give rise to Rejection Claims without  Purchaser's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (d) On the  Election  Date,  or if  later  the date  specified  in a notice
delivered  pursuant to Section  2.11(a),  Sellers shall reject in the Bankruptcy
Cases all Contracts listed on  Schedule 3.15(c)  that do not constitute  Assumed
Contracts.

     Section 2.12. Allocation of Purchase Price.

     (a) As soon as  reasonably  practicable,  but not  later  than one  hundred
twenty (120) days following the Closing,  Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers a schedule  which shall set forth the  allocation of the Purchase  Price
among  the  Purchased  Assets  and the  Assumed  Liabilities  (the  "Purchaser's
Allocation").  Sellers  shall  accept  and agree to the  Purchaser's  Allocation
unless such allocation is manifestly  unreasonable,  in which case Sellers shall
deliver written notice to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Purchaser's  Allocation.  Any payments  pursuant to Section 2.7 resulting from a
change in the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated to the
portion of the Purchase  Price paid with respect to the  Purchased  Assets.  Any
payment  pursuant to Section 2.5(d) shall be allocated to the Purchased  Assets.
Subject to the  requirements of any applicable Tax law, all Tax Returns filed by
Purchaser and Sellers shall be prepared consistently with such allocation.

     (b) In the event of any Purchase Price  adjustment  pursuant to Section 2.7
hereof after the delivery of the Adjustment  Report by Purchaser,  Purchaser and
Sellers  agree to adjust  the  allocation  of the  Purchase  Price  and  Assumed
Liabilities  to reflect  such  Purchase  Price  adjustment  and,  subject to the
requirements  of any applicable Tax laws, to file  consistently  any Tax Returns
required  as a result of such  Purchase  Price  adjustment.  In the event of any
payment  pursuant to Section  2.5(d) hereof after the delivery of the Adjustment
Report,  Purchaser  and Sellers  agree to adjust the  allocation of the Purchase
Price and Assumed  Liabilities  to reflect  such  payment,  and,  subject to the
requirements  of any  applicable Tax law, to file  consistently  any Tax Returns
required as a result of such payment.

     (c) If  Purchaser  and  Sellers are unable to agree upon any of the matters
set forth in Section 2.12(a) or (b), within thirty (30) days (or such later date
as is mutually  agreed upon by both  parties),  the matter or matters in dispute
shall be  submitted  to the Arbiter  or, if none was  retained,  to  independent
accountants  of  nationally  recognized  standing  reasonably   satisfactory  to
Purchaser and Sellers.

     (d) After the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare, in consultation with the
Purchaser and Purchaser's accountants, those statements or forms (including Form
8594)  required  by  Section 1060  of the Code and the  regulations  promulgated
thereunder.  Such  statements or forms shall be prepared  consistently  with the
allocation  under this  Section  2.12,  as adjusted  to reflect  any  adjustment
pursuant  to  Section  2.7 and any  payment  pursuant  to Section  2.5(d).  Such
statements or forms shall be filed by the parties with

<PAGE>

their  respective  federal income Tax Returns as required by Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and each party shall provide the
other party with a copy of such statement or form as filed.

obligation of such Seller  enforceable in accordance with its terms,  subject to
applicable bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium or similar Legal
Requirements which affect creditors' rights generally and by legal and equitable

<PAGE>

     (collectively,  the "SEC  Reports").  The SEC Reports (x) at the time filed
     complied as to form in all material  respects with the  requirements of the
     Exchange  Act,  and (y) did not at the time they  were  filed  contain  any
     untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to  state a  material  fact
     required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading.  None of the  subsidiaries  of Genuity is  required to file any
     statements  or reports with the  Commission  pursuant to Sections  13(a) or
     15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (b)  The   audited   consolidated   balance   sheet  of   Genuity   at
     December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999 and related  consolidated  statements  of
     income,  retained earnings and cash flow for the periods then ended and the
     notes thereto  included in the  applicable  SEC Report  (collectively,  the
     "Financial  Statements"),  (i) were,  except as  otherwise  noted  therein,
     prepared in accordance with GAAP Consistency,  and (ii) present  fairly, in
     all material respects,  the financial condition,  the results of operations
     and the retained  earnings and cash flow of Genuity as of the dates and for
     the periods indicated thereon.

          (c) The  unaudited  consolidated  balance  sheet of  Genuity as of the
     Interim Balance Sheet Date (the "Interim Balance  Sheet"),  and the related

          (d) The  supplemental  information  of Genuity  described  on Schedule
     3.5(d):  (i) was  prepared in good faith in the Ordinary Course of Business
     for the internal use of Sellers,  and (ii) to Sellers' Knowledge  presented
     fairly in all material  respects the information  purported to be presented
     therein as of the respective dates thereof.

     Section 3.6. [Intentionally omitted.]

     Section 3.7. [Intentionally omitted.]

     Section 3.8. [Intentionally omitted.]

     Section  3.9.  Inventory.   Except  as  set  forth  on  Schedule  3.9,  the
inventories,  including spare parts, replacement and component parts, of Sellers
relating to the Network, to the extent directly or indirectly  maintained by any
Seller  (the  "Inventory"),  are,  taken as a whole,  reasonably  sufficient  in
quantity and suitable for the maintenance  and operation of the Network,  to the
extent directly or indirectly  maintained by any Seller,  in the Ordinary Course
of Business.  Since September 1, 2002,  Sellers have not sold Inventory or other
Personal  Property  for  gross  proceeds  of more than  $1.2  million  or having
undepreciated book value of more than $17.5 million.

     Section 3.10. Real Property.

          (a) Schedule  3.10(a)-1  lists all real property  (including a list of
     each specific Seller entity name) owned by any Seller as of the date hereof
     and used in connection with

<PAGE>

     the  North  American  Business  (together  with all  building  improvements
     therein,  the  "Owned  Real  Property").  Except as set  forth on  Schedule
     3.10(a)-2,  each Seller has good,  marketable and indefeasible title to the
     Owned Real  Property  listed as owned by it on  Schedule  3.10(a)-1  in fee
     simple,  free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.  Except as
     set forth on Schedule 3.10(a)-2,  and except for Permitted Liens, there are
     no Contracts or Leases or other  agreements to which  Sellers'  interest in
     Owned  Real  Property  is  subject  granting  any Third  Party the right to
     purchase,  lease,  use or occupy any of the Owned  Real  Property  and,  to
     Sellers'  Knowledge,  there are no  Persons  (other  than any Seller or any
     Person under  Permitted  Liens) in possession or control of any part of the
     Owned Real Property.

          (b)  Schedule 3.10(b)-1  contains a list of all leases and  subleases,
     including  names of the parties  thereto and the location of the applicable
     premises,  with respect to all real property leased or subleased by Sellers
     as of the date  hereof  and used in  connection  with  the  North  American
     Business, and lists all material licenses, occupancy agreements,  rights of
     way, easement or any similar agreement  necessary for the operations of the
     North American Business as presently conducted (such leases,  subleases and
     other agreements,  together with all amendments thereto,  collectively, the
     "Leases",  and such real  property  the "Leased  Property").  Each Lease is
     valid,  binding and enforceable against Sellers and, to Sellers' Knowledge,
     except as set forth on  Schedule 3.10(b)-2,  the other  parties  thereto in
     accordance  with its terms,  and in full force and  effect,  subject in the
     case of  enforceability  against the other parties  thereto,  to applicable
     bankruptcy,   reorganization,   insolvency,  moratorium  or  similar  Legal
     Requirements  which affect  creditors'  rights  generally  and by legal and
     equitable  limitations on the enforceability of equitable remedies.  Except
     as set forth on  Schedule 3.10(b)-3,  Sellers have  performed  all material
     obligations  required to be performed by them under each of the Leases with
     Major Customers or Major Suppliers, other than monetary defaults that would
     not reasonably be expected to result in a termination of the Lease prior to
     the  commencement of the Bankruptcy Case and that would be cured by Sellers
     by payment of the Cure Amount.  Except as set forth on  Schedule 3.10(b)-3,
     neither Sellers nor, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  any other party thereto is in
     material default under any Lease (and no event has occurred which, with due
     notice or lapse of time or both,  would  constitute such a lapse or default
     by Sellers or, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  any other party thereto) other than
     in the case of Sellers  defaults  that would not  reasonably be expected to
     result in a  termination  of the  Lease  prior to the  commencement  of the
     Bankruptcy  Case and that  would be cured by Sellers by payment of the Cure
     Amount. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(b)-3, no material controversy,
     claim,  dispute or  disagreement  exists  between the parties to any of the
     Leases.  Sellers have previously made available to Purchaser a copy of each
     Lease  or  other   written   evidence   of  the   obligations,   listed  on
     Schedule 3.10(b)-1.  Since the Interim  Balance  Sheet Date,  no option has
     been exercised by Sellers or, to Sellers' Knowledge,  any other party under
     any of the Leases,  except  options whose  exercise has been evidenced by a
     written document,  a true, complete and accurate copy of which has been or,
     with respect to any such option exercised after the date hereof, will prior
     to the Closing be,  made  available  to  Purchaser  with the  corresponding
     Lease.
<PAGE>

          (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(c), Sellers have not received
     any  written  notice  of:  (i) any  violation  of any  material  applicable
     building,  zoning, land use or other similar Legal Requirement  (including,
     without  limitation,  the Americans  With  Disabilities  Act) in respect of
     Owned  Real  Property  or Leased  Property,  which has not been  heretofore
     remedied, which violations, individually or in combination with any others,
     would  materially  and  adversely  affect the ability of Sellers to use the
     affected parcel of material Owned Real Property or material Leased Property
     in the  manner  and  scope in which it is now  being  used or  operated  by
     Sellers; (ii) any operations on or uses of any material Owned Real Property
     and material Leased Property which constitute material  non-conforming uses
     under any applicable building, zoning, land use or other Legal Requirement;
     and (iii) other than published notice not actually received, any pending or
     contemplated  rezoning proceeding  materially  affecting any material Owned
     Real Property or any material Leased Property.

          (d) Sellers  have no  Knowledge  of and have not  received any written
     notice that there is existing,  pending or threatened:  (i) condemnation of
     any part of material Owned Real Property or material Leased Property by any
     Governmental  Agency; (ii) special assessments against any part of material
     Owned Real  Property  or  material  Leased  Property;  or (iii)  litigation
     against any Seller for breach of any  restrictive  covenant  affecting  any
     part of material Owned Real Property or material Leased Property.

          (e) The covenants, easements,  rights-of-way and other Liens affecting
     any material  Owned Real  Property or any material  Leased  Property do not
     with respect to each such Owned Real Property or Leased Property materially
     impair the ability to use any such Owned Real  Property or Leased  Property
     in the  operation  of the Business as presently  conducted.  The  Purchased
     Assets  include all  utilities  and services and rights of access to public
     roads,  streets or the like or valid easements over private streets,  roads
     or other  private  property  for such  ingress to and egress from  material
     Owned Real Property (and to Sellers' Knowledge,  material Leased Property),
     except as would not  materially  impair  the  ability to use any such Owned
     Real  Property  or Leased  Property  in the  operation  of the  Business as
     presently conducted.

          (f) No Seller is a "foreign person" within the meaning of Section 1445
     of the Code or is subject to withholding  under the Foreign  Investment and
     Real Property Tax Act of 1980.

          (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(g)-1,  to the extent required
     by Legal  Requirement,  Sellers  have paid in full all  material ad valorem
     property Taxes and other assessments  levied on the Owned Real Property and
     the  Leased  Property  (if  required  under the  Lease)  that  Sellers  are
     obligated to pay and that have heretofore become due and payable, except in
     the case of the representation being made as of the date hereof as is being
     contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings and for which a reserve
     in accordance  with GAAP  Consistency  has been set forth on the Business's
     books. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(g)-2, Sellers have no Knowledge
     of any tax abatements or exemptions  specifically  affecting the Owned Real
     Property or any proposed increase in

<PAGE>

     the assessed valuation of the Owned Real Property or of any proposed public
     improvement assessments.

     Section 3.11. Personal Property.

          (a)  Schedule  3.11(a)-1  contains a list of Personal  Property of the
     Business owned by any Seller with an original cost of $25,000 or more as of
     the Interim Balance Sheet Date (the "Material  Personal  Property").  As of
     the Interim Balance Sheet Date,  Sellers owned outright and had valid title
     to all Material Personal Property and all other Personal Property reflected
     as owned on the Interim  Balance Sheet subject to no Lien except  Permitted
     Liens and except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(a)-2.

          (b)  Schedule  3.11(b)  sets forth the name,  parties  and date of all
     leases with respect to Personal  Property to which any Seller is a party as
     of the date hereof  under which the annual rent and other  charges  are, in
     the aggregate,  $100,000 or more. Except as set forth on  Schedule 3.11(b),
     Sellers hold a valid  leasehold  interest in all of the  Personal  Property
     shown or required to be shown on  Schedule 3.11(b) as leased by any Seller,
     in each case under valid and enforceable leases.

          (c) Since December 31, 2001,  except as set forth on Schedule 3.11(c),
     the Personal  Property has been  maintained  in  accordance  with  Sellers'
     historical  practices.   The  Personal  Property,  taken  as  a  whole,  is
     reasonably  suitable  for the  conduct of the North  American  Business  as
     currently conducted.

     Section 3.12. Compliance with Legal Requirements; Permits.

          (a)  Except  as  set  forth  on  Schedule 3.12(a)-1,  Sellers  are  in
     compliance in all material respects with all Legal Requirements  applicable
     to the Business or any of the Purchased  Assets.  Since  December 31, 2001,
     except as set forth on  Schedule 3.12(a)-2,  Sellers  have not received any
     written (or, to their Knowledge,  oral) notice or other  communication from
     any  Governmental  Agency  regarding  any  actual,  alleged,  possible,  or
     potential  violation  of, or failure to comply,  in any  material  respect,
     with, any Legal Requirement.

          (b)  Schedule 3.12(b)-1  sets  forth  a list of  each  Permit  held by
     Sellers as of the date of this Agreement,  including the expiration date of
     such Permits.  The Permits listed on  Schedule 3.12(b)-1  constitute all of
     the  Permits  that are  necessary  for the  conduct  of the North  American
     Business or the  ownership  or use of the  Purchased  Assets in  connection
     therewith  as  currently  conducted,  owned and used by  Sellers.  All such
     Permits, except as noted on Schedule 3.12(b)-2 are in full force and effect
     and  no  proceeding  is  pending  or,  to  the  Knowledge  of  any  Seller,
     threatened,  to  revoke or limit  any such  Permit.  Except as set forth on
     Schedule 3.12(b)-3:

               (i) Sellers  are,  and at all times since  December 31, 2001 have
          been, in compliance in all material respects with all of the terms and
          requirements of each Permit held by Sellers  necessary for the conduct
          of  the  North  American  Business  or  the  ownership  or  use of the
          Purchased  Assets in  connection  therewith,  as currently  conducted,
          owned and used by Sellers;
<PAGE>

               (ii) Since  December  31,  2001,  Sellers  have not  received any
          written (or, to their Knowledge,  oral) notice or other  communication
          from  any  Governmental  Agency  regarding  (A) any  actual,  alleged,
          possible,  or potential violation of or failure to comply with, in any
          material  respect,  any  term or  requirement  of any  Permit  held by

     Sellers covenant with Purchaser that from and after the date hereof through

set forth in a Section 5.1 Consent, or (z) relates to Excluded Matters):

          (a) Operate in the Ordinary Course. Sellers shall operate the Business

     Contracts and Leases which,  in the case of this  clause (II),  require the
     annual payment or exchange of value of $100,000 or more (collectively,  the
     "Section 5.1 Agreements"):
<PAGE>

               (i) Sellers shall not  materially  amend or modify,  or waive any
          material term of, any Section 5.1 Agreement, except for settlements of
          disputes  with the  counterparty  of such Section 5.1 Agreement in the
          Ordinary Course of Business that are not reasonably  expected to alter
          to the detriment of Purchaser the post-Assumption  Date obligations of
          the  parties  under the  Section  5.1  Agreement  were it to become an
          Assumed Contract or an Assumed Lease as of the Closing Date.

               (ii) With  respect to each  Section  5.1  Agreement  (other  than
          Contracts with customers) that  (x) expires upon the conclusion of its
          stated term prior to the Closing Date,  (y) contains  a renewal option
          that  will  expire  prior to the  Closing  Date if not  exercised,  or
          (z) contains a right of Sellers which if timely exercised will prevent
          automatic  renewal and which  right will  expire  prior to the Closing
          Date:

                    A. Sellers shall give Purchaser  reasonable  advance written
               notice of such  expiration,  but in any  event,  shall  give such
               notice  not  less  than  ten  (10)  Business  Days  prior to such
               expiration date (or, if applicable,  any earlier  required notice
               date  with  respect  to  such  expiration   date)  (the  "Renewal
               Expiration Date") which notice shall specify:

                         (1) the Section 5.1 Agreement;

                         (2) the Renewal Expiration Date; and

                         (3)  whether  Sellers  intend to  extend or renew  such
                    Section  5.1  Agreement  or allow or cause such  Section 5.1
                    Agreement to terminate or lapse.

                    B. With  respect to each  Section  5.1  Agreement  for which
               Sellers  have  indicated  in the  notice  delivered  pursuant  to
               paragraph A above that their intention is to extend or renew such
               Section 5.1  Agreement,  unless  Purchaser  shall,  not less than
               five (5) Business Days prior to the Renewal  Expiration Date have
               provided Sellers with a written request to allow, or cause,  such
               Section 5.1 Agreement to expire (a "Lapse Request"), then Sellers
               shall:

                         (1) In the case of Section 5.1 Agreements  described in
                    Section 5.1(b)(ii)(x),  use commercially  reasonable efforts
                    to renew such Section 5.1 Agreement.

                    Section 5.1(b)(ii)(y), exercise such renewal option.

                         (3) In the case of Section 5.1 Agreements  described in
                    Section  5.1(b)(ii)(z),  allow such Section 5.1 Agreement to
                    automatically renew.
<PAGE>

                    C. In the event  Purchaser  delivers a Lapse  Request,  such
               Lapse Request shall not restrict the ability of Sellers to extend
               or renew the relevant  Section 5.1  Agreement;  provided that, if
               notwithstanding  the receipt of a Lapse Request Sellers extend or
               renew the  relevant  Section  5.1  Agreement,  then no claims for
               rejection  damages pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
               with  respect to the extended or renewal term of such Section 5.1
               Agreement shall be deemed to be "Rejection Claims."

                    D. With  respect to each  Section  5.1  Agreement  for which
               Sellers  have  indicated  in the  notice  delivered  pursuant  to
               paragraph A  above that their intention is to allow or cause such
               Section  5.1  Agreement  to  terminate  or lapse,  Purchaser  may
               provide  Sellers with a written  direction not less than five (5)
               Business Days prior to the Renewal Expiration Date to extend such
               Section 5.1 Agreement (a "Renewal Request").  Upon timely receipt
               of a Renewal  Request,  Sellers  shall (1) in the case of Section
               5.1   Agreements   described   in  Section   5.1(b)(ii)(x),   use
               commercially   reasonable  efforts  to  renew  such  Section  5.1
               Agreement, (2) in the case of Section 5.1 Agreements described in
               Section  5.1(b)(ii)(y),  exercise such renewal option, and (3) in
               the  case  of  Section  5.1   Agreements   described  in  Section
               5.1(b)(ii)(z),  take no action to prevent such automatic renewal.
               To the extent a Renewal Request is not timely  received,  Sellers
               shall allow or cause such  Section 5.1  Agreement to terminate or
               lapse.

               (iii)  Sellers shall not allow or suffer to terminate any Section
          5.1 Agreement  (other than those that expire in accordance  with their
          terms as permitted by Section 5.1(b)(ii)).

          (c) Additional Affirmative Covenants: Sellers shall

               (i) operate the Network in compliance with the performance levels
          set forth on Schedule 3.29(b).

          as a whole, reasonably suitable for their current use;

               (iii) make any and all filings  required under  applicable  Legal
          Requirements and file all applications required for the renewal of the

          connection  therewith,  as  currently  conducted,  owned  and  used by
          Sellers in a timely fashion;

               (iv) use commercially  reasonable  efforts in the Ordinary Course
          of  Business  to  (x) keep  available  generally  the  services of the
          present  officers  and  key  Business  Employees,  and  (y) except  as
          permitted by 5.1(b)(ii),  preserve

          vendors having material business dealings with the Business;

               (v) perform in all material respects their obligations under:

                    A. all Contracts  and Leases with Major  Customers and Major

               assumption by Sellers of the Contract or Lease and the assignment
               of such  Contract  or Lease  to  Purchaser  pursuant  to the Sale
               Order.

               (vi) use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to keep in full force

          be a Schedule Update for purposes of this Agreement; and

          of Business;

               (vi) settle,  release or forgive any material claim or litigation

          the  counterparty  of Contracts  or Leases in the  Ordinary  Course of
          Business that are not reasonably expected to alter to the detriment of
          Purchaser the  post-Assumption  Date  obligations of the parties under
          the  Contract  or Lease  were it to become an Assumed  Contract  or an
          Assumed Lease as of the Closing Date;

               (vii) enter into any material transaction (other than pursuant to
          Contracts in effect on the date hereof and set forth on Schedule 3.13)
          of any nature  with,  any  director,  executive  officer  or  Business
          Employee;
<PAGE>

               (viii)   acquire,   lease  or  agree  to  acquire  or  lease  any
          "indefeasible  right of use" for any  telecommunications  facility  or

               (ix)  incur,  or suffer to exist,  any Lien on the  assets of the
          Business   other  than   Permitted   Liens  and  Liens  that  will  be
          extinguished by the Sale Order.

          (e) Purchaser  shall be deemed to have approved any request for waiver
     of  this  Section  5.1  as it  relates  to a  specific  set  of  facts  and
     circumstances  five (5)  Business Days after either (a) a  specific  e-mail
     request is sent to it at  raouf.abdel@level3.com,  with a copy, which shall
     not constitute notice, to mlefkort@willkie.com, or (b) a specific notice is
     given  pursuant to Section 13.1,  unless prior to such fifth (5th) Business
     Day,  Purchaser  shall have sent a objection  to such  request by e-mail to
     savruch@genuity.com, with a copy to ira.parker@genuity.com.

          (f) No action taken by any Seller in accordance with the express terms
     of any Lapse Request or a Section 5.1 Consent (other than a Renewal Request
     or a denial of a request for a waiver or consent) shall constitute a breach
     of any  representation,  warranty or other covenant that would arise out of
     undertaking the action specifically requested or directed.

          (g)  From  the  date of  commencement  of the  Bankruptcy  Case to the
     earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Purchaser
     shall have no right to equitable or monetary  remedies with respect to this
     Section  5.1;  provided,  however,  that this  sentence  shall not restrict
     Purchaser from asserting closing conditions in accordance with Section 7.2,
     or  terminating  this  Agreement in accordance  with Section 12.1.  For the
     avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.1 shall restrict the board of
     directors  of any  Seller  from  taking any  action  which they  believe is
     required by their fiduciary duty; provided,  however,  that, subject to the
     preceding  sentence,  in such event the  Sellers  shall  continue to remain
     liable to Purchaser for monetary damages for the breach of this Section.

     Section 5.2.  Information and Access.  Sellers shall, upon reasonable prior
notice,  permit  representatives  of Purchaser to have reasonable  access during
normal  business  hours,  and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
operations of, and otherwise reasonably acceptable to, Sellers, to all premises,
properties,  personnel,  accountants, books, records, contracts and documents of
or  pertaining to the  Business.  If requested by Purchaser,  Sellers shall also
permit Purchaser (and assist Purchaser as reasonably  necessary) to perform,  at
Purchaser's  sole  cost and  expense,  Phase I and Phase II  environmental  site
assessments.  Purchaser and each of its  representatives  will treat and hold as
confidential all information  obtained by or provided to them in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Confidentiality  Agreement,  which  Confidentiality  Agreement
remains in full  force and  effect.  No  investigation  by or other  information
received  by  Purchaser  shall  operate  as a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  any
representation,  warranty,  covenant  or  agreement  given  or made  by  Sellers
hereunder.

     Section 5.3. Confidentiality  Agreements. At the Closing, Sellers shall, to
the maximum extent assignable  pursuant to Section 363 and/or Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code,

<PAGE>

assign to Purchaser the benefits of all confidentiality  agreements entered into
after  October 1, 2001,  relating to the  possible  sale of the  Business or any
material portion of the assets thereof.

     Section  5.4.  Notices of Certain  Events.  Sellers  shall  promptly  after
obtaining Knowledge thereof, notify Purchaser of:

          (a) any written  notice from any Person  alleging  that the consent of
     such  Person is or may be  required  in  connection  with the  transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement;

          (b) any written notice from any Governmental Agency in connection with
     the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

          (c) any Proceedings commenced or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened in
     writing  against  Sellers  that if pending  on the date of this  Agreement,
     would  have  been  required  to have been  disclosed  pursuant  to  Section
     3.20(a); and

          (d) the breach by any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant
     or agreement  contained in this  Agreement or the  occurrence  of any event
     that in any such case would reasonably be expected to result in the failure
     of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2; provided,  however, that
     any failure by Sellers to perform the covenant contained in this clause (d)
     shall not be  considered  noncompliance  with a covenant  for  purposes  of
     Section 7.2(b).

     Section 5.5. Schedule Updates.

          (a) Not less than two (2)  Business  Days prior to the  Closing  Date,
     Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser  updates of Schedules  3.10(a)-1 and
     -2, 3.10(b)-1,  -2 and -3, 3.10(c),  3.10(g),  3.11(b),  3.12(a),  3.12(b),
     3.14(a), 3.14(b), 3.14(c), 3.15(b), 3.20, 3.23, 3.29(a), and 3.29(b), which
     shall set forth the  additional  information  that would be  required  were
     Sellers  required  to  make  the  representations  and  warranties  in  the
     corresponding   Sections  of  this   Agreement   as  of  the  Closing  Date
     notwithstanding the fact that such representations and warranties expressly
     speak as of the date of this Agreement or as of a different date as well as
     an update of the Customer Contract Schedule as of such date  (collectively,
     the "Schedule Updates").

          (b) The  Schedule  Updates  shall not affect the  determination  as to
     whether any  representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement (other
     than Section  3.30) was breached as of the date of this  Agreement or as of
     the Closing Date.

     Section 5.6.  Purchaser  Schedule  Updates.  At any time,  and from time to
time,  prior to the Closing,  Purchaser may deliver a written  notice to Sellers
indicating  which if any of the  Leases  or  Contracts  listed  in the  Schedule
Updates or the information  delivered  pursuant to Section  5.1(c)(viii) or (ix)
shall be added to Schedule 1.6,  whereupon such Schedule shall be deemed amended
without  any further  action  required  by the  parties to this  Agreement.  Any
Contract or Lease listed in the Schedule  Updates or the  information  delivered
pursuant to Section  5.1(c)(viii) or (ix) that was not previously  listed on the
Schedules and that is not the

<PAGE>

subject of a notice  pursuant  to the first  sentence of this  Section  shall be
deemed to be an Undesignated Agreement.

     Section 5.7. Title Insurance.  Should Purchaser at its own cost and expense
choose to obtain  title  insurance  with  respect  to the Owned  Real  Property,
Sellers shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cooperate with Purchaser
with respect to obtaining such title insurance.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

     the transactions contemplated hereby. Genuity and Purchaser shall each bear
     one-half of any filing fees in  connection  with such filing and if Genuity
     or Purchaser  pays more than  one-half of any such filing fees,  Genuity or
     Purchaser,  as applicable,  will, upon request of the other,  reimburse the
     other for any amount in excess of one-half. Sellers and Purchaser shall, or
     shall  cause  their  ultimate  parents,  to take or cause  to be taken  all
     actions  and do or  cause  to be  done  all  things  necessary,  proper  or
     advisable to obtain prompt  termination of the waiting period under the HSR
     Act,  which  efforts  shall  include,  without  limitation,  to the  extent
     necessary (i) interviewing the parties' relevant employees,  (ii) reviewing
     the   parties'   relevant   non-confidential   documents   and   data   and
     (iii) reviewing  industry analyses specifically related to the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate, (i) in determining whether,
     in  addition to the  filings  required by the HSR Act,  any action by or in
     respect of, or filing with, any Governmental  Agency in connection with the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is required
     and (ii) in taking such commercially  reasonable actions or making any such
     filings,  furnishing  information  required  in  connection  therewith.  As
     promptly as  practicable,  following  the  execution  and  delivery of this
     Agreement by the parties,  Sellers and Purchaser shall prepare and file any
     other application,  report, or other filing required to be submitted to any
     other Governmental Agency in connection with the transactions  contemplated

<PAGE>

     motion (the "Sale Motion"),  notices and proposed orders,  each in form and
     substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to  Purchaser  seeking the  Bankruptcy
     Court's issuance of:

               (i) an  Order  in the  form of  Exhibit F  hereto  (the  "Bidding
          Procedures Order"); and

          (b)  Sellers  shall  serve a copy of the  Sale  Motion  on all  taxing
     authorities  that have  jurisdiction  over the Business,  all  Governmental
     Agencies   having   jurisdiction   over  the   Business   with  respect  to
     Environmental Laws, and on the attorneys general of all states in which the
     Purchased  Assets are  located.  Sellers  shall  serve a notice of the Sale
     Motion  on all  parties  to  Contracts  and  Leases  (other  than  Excluded
     Matters).

          (c)  Pursuant  to  Bankruptcy  Code  Section 364(c)(1),   the  Expense
     Reimbursement   and  the   Break-Up   Fee   shall   receive   superpriority
     administrative claim status. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 364(c)(1),
     the administrative  claims in respect of the Expense  Reimbursement and the

     behalf of the Sellers  (including forms of orders and notices to interested
     parties)  directly  relating to the Purchased  Assets or this  Agreement at
     least  two (2)  Business  Days,  unless the  exigencies of time prevent the
     period from being that long,  prior to the filing thereof in the Bankruptcy
     Cases  so as  to  allow  Purchasers  to  provide  reasonable  comments  for
     incorporation  into same;  except that the Sale Motion  (including forms of
     orders and notices to interested  parties)  shall be provided to Purchasers
     at least  three (3)  Business  Days prior to its filing.  The Sellers shall
     also  give to the  Purchaser  written  notice  and a copy  of all  motions,
     applications and pleadings filed in the Bankruptcy Case with the Bankruptcy
     Court from and after the date hereof, at the time of such filing.

use or other similar  Taxes or fees (other than gains and income Taxes)  imposed
as a result of the sale of the Business to Purchaser  pursuant to this Agreement
are not exempted by the Sale Order, they shall be borne by Sellers.  Genuity and
Purchaser shall accurately  prepare and timely file all Tax Returns with respect
to any  such  sales,  transfer,  use or other  similar  Taxes.  At the  Closing,
Purchaser  shall  remit to Genuity  such  properly  completed  resale  exemption
certificates  and other similar  certificates or instruments as are necessary to

<PAGE>

     Section 6.4. Property Taxes. Matters relating to real and personal property
Taxes and other ad valorem Taxes and assessments on Purchased Assets  ("Property
Taxes") shall be determined as provided in this Section 6.4.

          (a) Straddle Period Property Taxes.

               (i) With  respect to each  jurisdiction  in which a  Governmental
          Agency imposes  Property Taxes,  the Property Taxes arising out of the
          Assessment Date immediately preceding or occurring on the Closing Date
          (the  "Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes") shall be allocated  between
          Purchaser  and  Sellers  based  on the  number  of days in the  period
          between the  Assessment  Date  immediately  preceding the Closing Date
          (the "Last  Assessment  Date")  and the  Assessment  Date  immediately
          following the Closing Date (the "Next Assessment  Date"). The pro rata
          portion of the Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes  attributable  to the
          period  from the Last  Assessment  Date to the  Closing  Date shall be
          allocated to Sellers ("Sellers'  Property Tax Portion").  The pro rata
          portion of the Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes  attributable  to the
          period  from the  Closing  Date to the Next  Assessment  Date shall be
          allocated to Purchaser ("Purchaser's Property Tax Portion").

               (ii) The Straddle Period Property Taxes (A) paid by Sellers prior
          to the Closing Date or (B) assessed by a Governmental  Agency to which
          Sellers fail to provide  appropriate notice of the Bankruptcy Case and
          the Sale Motion in  accordance  with Section  6.4(f) shall  constitute
          Excluded  Liabilities,  and any Straddle  Period  Property Taxes other
          than  those  described  in  (A)  and  (B)  shall  constitute   Assumed
          Liabilities.

               (iii) The Base Price shall be increased by the amount, if any, by
          which the Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes paid by Sellers before the
          Closing Date  exceeds  Sellers'  Property Tax Portion.  The Base Price
          shall be decreased by the amount,  if any, by which Sellers'  Property
          Tax Portion exceeds the Straddle Period Property Taxes paid by Sellers
          before the Closing Date.

          (b) Other Property Taxes. With respect to each jurisdiction in which a
     Governmental  Agency imposes Property Taxes, the Property Taxes arising out
     of any Assessment Date prior to the Last Assessment Date (the "Old Property
     Taxes") shall constitute Excluded Liabilities.

          (c)  Sellers  shall have the right to  commence,  control,  prosecute,
     settle and compromise any and all Proceedings  relating to (i) Old Property
     Taxes,  and  (ii) the  valuation  of the  Purchased  Assets  for  which the
     relevant  Assessment Date is more than six months prior to the Closing Date
     and the resulting  Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes.  Such right shall not
     derogate Purchaser's right to a pro rata share of any refund,  abatement or
     similar reduction based on the Purchaser's Property Tax Portion.  Purchaser
     shall take all action  reasonably  necessary  for Sellers to  exercise  the
     rights provided to them pursuant to this clause (c).
<PAGE>

          (d) Purchaser shall accurately prepare and timely file all Tax Returns
     relating  to Straddle  Period  Property  Taxes due after the Closing  Date.
     Purchaser shall have the right to commence,  control, prosecute, settle and
     compromise  any  and  all  Proceedings  relating  to the  valuation  of the
     Purchased  Assets for which the relevant  Assessment  Date is six months or
     less prior to the Closing Date and the resulting  Straddle  Period Property
     Taxes. Such rights shall not derogate Sellers' right to a pro rata share of
     any refund,  abatement or similar  reduction based on Sellers' Property Tax
     Portion.  Sellers shall take all action reasonably  necessary for Purchaser
     to  exercise  the  rights  provided  to it  pursuant  to  this  clause (d),
     including  without  limitation  to the extent  required to file Tax Returns
     appointing  Purchaser as Sellers' agent,  and executing powers of attorney.
     Sellers shall have the right to participate,  at their own expense,  in any
     Proceeding described in this clause (d).

          (e) In connection  with any  Proceeding  pursuant to this Section 6.4,
     the parties  shall  reasonably  assist each other and  cooperate  with each
     other  in the  conduct  of  such  Proceeding,  including  by  making  their
     personnel and books and records  reasonably  available to the other parties
     hereto.

          (f) Sellers shall  (i) provide  appropriate  notice of the  Bankruptcy
     Case, the Sale Motion and related matters to all Governmental Agencies that
     may seek to collect  Property Taxes or impose on Sellers,  Purchaser or any
     Purchased  Asset  penalties  for  any  Property  Taxes,  and  (ii) use  all
     commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain certificates,  releases or other
     appropriate  documentation  from such  Governmental  Agencies to the extent
     such  Governmental   Agencies  provide  such   certificates,   releases  or
     documentation  in the ordinary  course,  providing that such Property Taxes
     have been paid or are not owed.

     Section  6.5.  Certain  Provisions  Relating to Consents,  Cooperation  and
Adequate Assurance.

          (a)  Subject to the  limitations  of Section  5.1,  Sellers  shall use
     commercially  reasonable  efforts  prior to and after the  Closing  Date to
     obtain  all  consents  of  Governmental   Agencies  and  counterparties  to
     Contracts and Leases that Purchaser has designated as Assumed  Contracts or
     Assumed  Leases  that are  required  in  connection  with the  transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement;  provided,  however, that Sellers shall not
     be obligated to offer or to pay any  consideration  or grant any  financial
     accommodation in connection therewith.

          (b) Parent and  Purchaser  shall prior to and after the  Closing  Date
     cooperate as  reasonably  necessary or desirable to secure such consents of
     Governmental  Agencies and to provide adequate  assurance of performance to
     counterparties to Assumed Contracts and Assumed Leases, including,  without
     limitation, providing to such Third Party information,  including financial
     information,  regarding  Purchaser's  intended use of the Purchased Assets.
     Upon the  written  request of  Sellers,  Purchaser  shall use  commercially
     reasonable  efforts to  cooperate  with Sellers with respect to the matters
     referred to in clauses (c), (d) and (e) of Section 6.7.

     Section 6.7. Best Efforts.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this  Agreement,  and subject to Section 6.5 with respect to the matters covered
thereby, each of the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to take, or cause

proper or advisable  consistent with applicable Legal Requirements to consummate
and make effective in the most expeditious  manner  practicable the transactions
contemplated  hereby.   Without  limiting  the  foregoing,   Sellers  shall  not

          (a) Sellers shall promptly notify  Purchaser  orally and in writing of
     any request for information,  proposal, discussion,  negotiation or inquiry
     received after the date of this  Agreement in connection  with any Takeover
     Proposal  and  Sellers  shall  promptly  (but in any event  within  one (1)
     Business Day) communicate to Purchaser the material terms and conditions of
     any such proposal, discussion,  negotiation or inquiry which it may receive
     (and will  promptly  provide to Purchaser  copies of any written  materials
     received  by  Sellers  in  connection   with  such  proposal,   discussion,
     negotiation or inquiry) and the identity of the person making such proposal
     or inquiry or engaging in such discussions or negotiation.

          (b) Sellers shall not furnish  information  concerning their business,
     properties   or  assets  to  any  Third   Party,   except   pursuant  to  a
     confidentiality  agreement  with terms and  conditions no less  restrictive
     than those contained in the  Confidentiality  Agreement.  Sellers shall not
     release  any  Third  Party  from,  or  waive  any  provision  of,  any such
     confidentiality  agreement  or any similar  confidentiality  or  standstill
     agreement to which any Seller is a party. Sellers shall promptly provide to

<PAGE>

     information  concerning the Sellers  provided to any other Person which was
     not  previously  provided to  Purchaser.  To the extent  that this  Section
     6.8(b) conflicts with the Bidding  Procedures Order, the Bidding Procedures
     Order shall govern.

          (c) Sellers shall keep  Purchaser  informed of the status and material
     details  (including  amendments  or proposed  amendments)  of any  Takeover
     Proposal.  Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business
     Day) notify Purchaser in writing at such time as any Takeover  Proposal has

shall survive the Closing.

     Section 10.2. Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Purchaser.

          (a) Subject to Section 10.5,  in the event any Seller  breaches any of
     its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or
     Ancillary Agreements or in any certificate delivered by any Seller pursuant
     to this  Agreement or Ancillary  Agreements  and provided  that,  as to any
     claim for breach of  representation  or  warranty  or of  Limited  Survival

     and severally  indemnify  Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against all
     Damages  Purchaser and its Affiliates  suffer resulting from or arising out
     of,  relating  to  or  caused  by  such  event;  provided,  however,  that:

     representation  or warranty of Sellers  contained  in  Article III  of this

     Agreement,  and no such  indemnity  shall be payable  until  Purchaser  has
     suffered  aggregate  Damages,  by reason of all such  breaches in excess of
     $5 million,  and  (ii) Sellers  shall not have any  obligation to indemnify
     Purchaser  from and against any  Damages  resulting  from the breach of any

     Agreement  or of any  covenant  contained  in Section  5.1 in excess of the

<PAGE>

          (b)  Without  limiting  the  generality  or effect  of the  foregoing,
     Sellers  shall  indemnify,  defend  and  hold  harmless  Purchaser  and its
     Affiliates  from and against any and all Damages  resulting from or arising
     out of any Excluded  Liability or any claim by a Third Party for payment of
     an Excluded Liability.

          (c) The Indemnification provided for in this Section 10.2 shall not be
     limited by any  investigation at any time made by or on behalf of Purchaser
     or Parent or any  knowledge  or  information  that  Purchaser or Parent may
     have.

     Section 10.3. Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Sellers.

          (a) Subject to Section  10.5, in the event  Purchaser  breaches any of
     its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or
     any  Ancillary  Agreement  or in any  certificate  delivered  by  Purchaser
     pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and provided that, as
     to any claim for  breach of  representation  or  warranty,  Sellers  make a
     written claim for  indemnification  against Purchaser within the applicable
     survival  period,   then  Purchaser  shall  indemnify   Sellers  and  their
     Affiliates  from all Damages  Sellers suffer  resulting from or arising out
     of, relating to or caused by such event.

          (b)  Without  limiting  the  generality  or effect  of the  foregoing,
     Purchaser  shall  indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless  Sellers  and their
     Affiliates  from and against any and all Damages  resulting from or arising
     out of any Assumed  Liability  or any claim by a Third Party for payment of
     an Assumed Liability.

     Section 10.4.  Matters Involving Third Parties.  Subject to Section 6.4(c),
(d) and (e):

          (a) If any third party  notifies  any party  hereto (the  "Indemnified
     Party")  with  respect  to any  matter  which  may give rise to a claim for
     indemnification  against the other party hereto (the "Indemnifying  Party")
     under this  Article X,  then the  Indemnified  Party  shall use  reasonable
     efforts to notify the Indemnifying  Party thereof promptly and in any event
     within ten (10) days after receiving any written notice from a third party;
     provided,  however,  that no delay on the part of the Indemnified  Party in
     notifying the Indemnifying  Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
     any obligation  hereunder  unless,  and then solely to the extent that, the
     Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

          (b) Once the  Indemnified  Party has given notice of the matter to the
     Indemnifying  Party, the Indemnified Party may, subject to the Indemnifying
     Party's   rights  to  assume  the  defense  of  such  matter   pursuant  to
     paragraph (c)  below,  defend  against  the  matter in any  manner it deems
     appropriate.  The  Indemnified  Party  shall  keep the  Indemnifying  Party
     informed as to the status of such actions.

          (c) The  Indemnifying  Party may at any point in time choose to assume
     the defense of all of such matter if:

               (i)  the   Indemnifying   Party  provides   evidence   reasonably
          satisfactory  to the  Indemnified  Party of its ability to provide the
          indemnification  required

<PAGE>

          pursuant  to this  Article X, which shall be deemed  satisfied  if the
          amount  of the  Escrowed  Funds,  less the  amount of  pending  claims
          against the Escrow Funds, is greater than the amount at issue;

               (ii) in the case where  Purchaser is the Indemnified  Party,  the
          Purchaser does not notify the  Indemnifying  Party following a request
          by the Indemnifying  Party to assume the defense of the matter that in
          Purchaser's  reasonable  judgment  the Damages to which  Purchaser  is
          exposed exceed the Cap; and

               (iii) there are no legal  defenses  available to the  Indemnified
          Party that are different from or additional to those  available to the
          Indemnifying Party.

          (d) Upon assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party:

               (i) the  Indemnifying  Party shall defend the  Indemnified  Party
          against the matter with counsel of its choice reasonably  satisfactory
          to the Indemnified Party,

               (ii) the  Indemnified  Party may retain  separate  counsel at its
          sole cost and expense  (except  that the  Indemnifying  Party shall be
          responsible  for the fees and expenses of one separate  co-counsel for
          all  Indemnified  Parties  to the  extent  the  Indemnified  Party  is
          advised,  in writing  by its  outside  counsel,  that  either  (x) the
          counsel  the  Indemnifying  Party  has  selected  has  a  conflict  of
          interest, or (y) there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified
          Party that are different from or additional to those  available to the
          Indemnifying Party),

               (iii) the  Indemnifying  Party shall  reimburse  the  Indemnified
          Party for the  reasonable  costs of defense or  investigation  for the
          period prior to the assumption of the defense, and

               (iv)  The   Indemnified   Party  shall  make   available  to  the
          Indemnifying  Party and its  attorneys and  accountants  all books and
          records of the  Indemnified  Party  relating  to such  proceedings  or
          litigation  and  the  parties  agree  to  render  to each  other  such
          assistance  as they may  reasonably  require of each other in order to
          ensure  the  proper  and  adequate  defense  of  any  such  action  or
          proceeding.

          (e) Assumption of the defense of any matter by the Indemnifying  Party
     shall  without  further  action  constitute  an  irrevocable  waiver by the
     Indemnifying  Party of its right to claim at a later  date that such  third
     party  action for which the defense was assumed is not a proper  matter for
     indemnification pursuant to this Article X.

          (f) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of a judgment
     or enter into any settlement with respect to any matter which may give rise
     to  a  claim  for  indemnification  without  the  written  consent  of  the
     Indemnifying  Party,  which  consent  may not be  unreasonably  withheld or
     delayed;  provided,  however,  that if the Indemnifying Party has failed to
     provide indemnification  required to be provided pursuant to this Article X
     for twenty (20) days after a request  therefor,  then the

<PAGE>

     Indemnified  Party may take any such  action  without  the  consent  of the
     Indemnifying Party.

          (g) The  Indemnifying  Party  shall  not  consent  to the  entry  of a
     judgment  with  respect  to any  matter  which may give rise to a claim for
     indemnification  or enter  into any  settlement  which  does not  include a
     provision  whereby the  plaintiff  or claimant in the matter  releases  the
     Indemnified  Party from all  liability  with respect  thereto,  without the
     written consent of the Indemnified  Party (not to be unreasonably  withheld
     or delayed).

     Section 10.5. Certain Additional Provisions Relating to Indemnification.

          (a) The  indemnification  provisions set forth in this Article X shall
     only  apply  after the  Closing  Date,  and after the  Closing  Date  shall
     constitute  the sole and  exclusive  recourse  and remedy  available to the
     parties  hereto  with  respect to  monetary  damages  for the breach of any
     representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
     or in any Ancillary  Agreement or in any certificate  delivered pursuant to
     this Agreement except for actual fraud.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Agreement  to the  contrary,
     Purchaser's  sole recourse for claims for breach of any  representation  or
     warranty of Sellers  contained in Article III of this Agreement or covenant
     contained in Section 5.1 shall be to the Escrowed Funds, except in the case
     of actual  fraud,  or as provided  for in the next two  sentences.  Sellers
     shall  directly pay to Purchaser any  indemnification  due pursuant to this
     Article X   for  all   matters,   other  than  claims  for  breach  of  any
     representation  or warranty of Sellers contained in Article III or covenant
     contained in Section 5.1, and unless Purchaser  expressly  consents thereto
     in writing,  such amounts shall not be payable from, or reduce the Escrowed
     Funds. In the event that any indemnification with respect to a matter other
     than a breach of any  representation  or warranty of Sellers  contained  in
     Article III of this  Agreement or of any covenant  contained in Section 5.1
     is paid from the Escrowed  Funds,  Sellers shall restore such amount to the
     Escrowed  Funds by wire  transfer of  immediately  available  funds  within
     three (3) Business Days.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  for
     purposes of this Article X, in determining the existence of a breach of any
     representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement and the amount of Damages,
     no effect shall be given to any qualification as to materiality or Material
     Adverse  Effect  (other  than  qualifications  contained  in  Sections 3.5,
     3.20(b), 3.20(c), 5.1(b)(i),  5.1(c)(ii),  5.1(d)(vi), and 5.1(d)(vii), and
     the first sentence of Section  3.10(b),  clause (xi) of Section 3.14(b) and
     the first sentence of Section 3.19).

          (d) No  indemnification  shall be available to Purchaser for breach of
     any  representation,  warranty,  covenant  or  agreement  by Sellers to the
     extent such breach results in an Adjustment to the Purchase Price.

          (e) Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 364(c)(1), the indemnification
     obligations   of  Sellers   pursuant  to  this   Article X   shall  receive
     superpriority  administrative  claim status.  Pursuant to  Bankruptcy  Code
     Section 364(c)(1),   the   administrative   claims

<PAGE>

     in respect of the  indemnification  obligations of Sellers pursuant to this
     Article X shall have priority over any and all  administrative  expenses of
     the kinds specified in Bankruptcy Code Sections 503(b),  506(c),  507(a) or
     507(b).

          (f) All payments by an  Indemnifying  Party under  Article X  shall be
     treated as an  adjustment to the Purchase  Price for all foreign,  federal,
     state and local income Tax purposes.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

     each Transferred Employee.

          (c) Terms of  Employment.  Purchaser  shall not  assume  any  Employee
     Benefit  Plan or any other plan,  program or  arrangement,  and,  except as
     expressly  provided  in  this  Article XI,   the  terms  of  a  Transferred
     Employee's  employment  with the  Purchaser  (or an  Affiliate)  after  the
     Closing shall be upon such terms and  conditions as Purchaser,  in its sole
     discretion,  shall  determine.   Purchaser  shall  grant  each  Transferred
     Employee  all  service   credit  with  Sellers  (based  on  the  employment
     commencement date set forth in Business Employee Schedule), for purposes of
     eligibility  and   participation   in  the  benefit  plans,   programs  and

the  right to  modify or  terminate  such  benefits  and its  benefit  plans and
programs  from time to time, to the extent not  inconsistent  with Section 11.3.
The Transferred Employees shall participate under Purchaser's medical and dental
plans as of the Closing Date,  such  participation  shall be without any waiting

     Section  11.3.  Certain  Additional  Provisions  Relating to Severance  and
Retention Bonuses for Transferred Employees.

          (a) Severance.

               (i) As a condition to  Purchaser's  offer of  employment  to each
          Business  Employee  Offeree,  such Business  Employee Offeree shall be
          required to waive the payment  (such  waiver to be effective as of the
          Closing  Date),  of any benefits under the Genuity Inc. 2002 Severance
          Benefit  Plan (as such  plan was in effect  on  October 23, 2002,  the
          "Genuity  Severance Plan"). A copy of the Genuity Severance Plan as in
          effect on October 23, 2002, is attached hereto as Schedule 11.3.

               (ii) In the event that during the twelve month  period  following
          the  Closing  Date,  the  employment  of  any   Transferred   Employee
          (excluding  any  Transferred  Employee whose  employment  agreement is
          listed on Item 2 of Schedule 1.1)  terminates  (the  effective date of
          such  termination  being  referred  to

<PAGE>

          as the "Transferred  Employee  Termination  Date") such that he or she
          would have been  entitled  to  severance  benefits  under the  Genuity
          Severance Plan had such Transferred  Employee  remained an employee of
          Genuity  until  the  Transferred  Employee  Termination  Date  and the
          employment of such Transferred  Employee with Genuity terminated as of
          the Transferred  Employee  Termination Date  (disregarding  the waiver
          described in Section 11.3(a)(i)),  then Purchaser shall, pursuant to a
          severance plan sponsored and maintained by Purchaser that provides for
          lump  sum  severance  benefits  that  are no less  favorable  than the
          severance  benefits  provided under the Genuity Severance Plan, pay to
          such Transferred Employee as lump sum severance an amount equal to the
          severance amount such Transferred Employee would have been entitled to
          receive  under  the  Genuity   Severance  Plan  assuming  the  Genuity
          Severance  Plan had remained in effect  (including  an amount equal to
          the  costs   associated  with  financial   planning  and  outplacement
          services,  plus an  amount  equal  to the  greater  of (x) the cost of
          continuation  coverage under Purchaser's  medical and dental plans for
          each such Transferred Employee's severance period less the Transferred
          Employee's  cost for such coverage based on (A) the medical and dental
          plan elections in place under  Purchaser's  plans for such Transferred
          Employee on the date immediately prior to such Transferred  Employee's
          termination of employment,  and (B) such Transferred  Employee's title
          or color "band" as provided in the Genuity Severance Plan, and (y) the
          cost of such  continuation  coverage  under  COBRA  for the  severance
          period (as  determined  pursuant to clause (B), plus in either case an
          amount equal to the income taxes that would be payable with respect to
          such greater amount utilizing the top marginal bracket for federal and
          state  income  taxes) less the  Employee's  portion of the premium for
          such  coverage);  provided  that no  severance  benefits  will be paid
          unless and until the  terminated  Transferred  Employee  executes  and
          delivers  to Parent a valid and  binding  waiver  and  release  of all
          claims  against  Parent  and  its  Affiliates,  and  their  respective
          employees, officers, directors, shareholders, representatives, agents,
          attorneys and advisors and their successors,  within a reasonable time
          period  specified by Parent,  and the  revocation  period set forth in
          such release has expired.

          (b) Retention Payments.

               (i) In  connection  with  Purchaser's  offer of employment to the
          Business  Employee  Offerees  (including  for this  purpose any person
          whose employment agreement is listed on Item 2 of Schedule 1.1),  such
          Business Employee Offerees shall be required to waive the payment from
          the Sellers,  as of the Closing Date, of twenty-five  percent (25%) of
          the aggregate  benefits payable under such Business Employee Offeree's
          Retention Agreement.

               (ii) With  respect  to any  Transferred  Employee  who waives the
          payment,  as of the Closing Date, of twenty-five  percent (25%) of the
          aggregate  benefits  under  such  Transferred   Employee's   Retention
          Agreement, the terms of such Transferred Employee's Offer Letter shall
          include  Purchaser's  obligation  to pay a  retention  bonus  of equal
          amount payable within  fifteen (15) days of

<PAGE>

          June 30, 2003, subject to the conditions set forth in such Transferred
          Employee's Retention Agreement.

     Section 11.4. Terms of Offer Letters. Each Offer Letter shall include terms
substantially as provided in Sections 11.1(b), and 11.3.

     Section 11.5. WARN Act Compliance.  Prior to the Closing Date,  Sellers and
their Affiliates shall comply in all material  respects with the requirements of
the WARN Act  (including  reliance on  provisions  of the WARN Act that serve to
reduce the notification  period), and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its
Affiliates  harmless from and against any and all Liabilities that Purchaser and
its Affiliates may incur by reason of any noncompliance by Sellers with the WARN
Act.  Prior to the Closing Date,  Genuity  shall notify  Purchaser in writing of
every  employment  termination from Sellers' single sites of employment at which
the Business is conducted, including, without limitation,  terminations that may
under the WARN Act be a basis for imposing WARN Act liability against Sellers.

     Section 11.6.  Plan  Liabilities.  Purchaser shall not assume any Liability
for any Employee Benefit Plan maintained,  sponsored by or contributed to by any
Sellers  or their  Affiliates  covering  current or former  Business  Employees.
Sellers or their  Affiliates  shall be  responsible  for providing  continuation
coverage under its Employee  Welfare  Benefit Plans for the Employees of Sellers
and any  other  employees  or  former  employees  of  Sellers,  as  required  by
Section 4980B  of the Code and Part 6 of  Title I  of ERISA and the  regulations
thereunder (together "COBRA"), or any relevant benefit continuation requirements
under applicable Legal Requirements;  provided that if at any time following the
Closing  Date,  Sellers  and each other  entity  (other than  Purchaser  and its
Affiliates) which together with any Seller would be considered an "employer" for
purposes of COBRA, cease altogether to provide a "group health plan" (as defined
in COBRA),  Purchaser shall,  commencing on the date of such cessation,  provide
group   health  plan   continuation   coverage   pursuant  to  COBRA  under  the
corresponding  group health plan of Purchaser  (or an Affiliate) to employees of
Sellers  and their  subsidiaries  and  former  employees  of  Sellers  and their
subsidiaries and their "qualified  beneficiaries" (as defined in COBRA), whether
or not such  coverage is required  under  COBRA.  The  duration of the  coverage
provided by  Purchaser  to such  employees  of Sellers  and their  subsidiaries,
former  employees  of  Sellers  and  their   subsidiaries  and  their  qualified
beneficiaries   shall  be  the  period   described  under  Treasury   Regulation
Section 54.4980B-7.  Sellers shall use commercially  reasonable  efforts to give
Purchaser  sufficient  prior written  notice of the  termination of any Employee
Benefit  Plan under which  employees  or former  employees  of Sellers and their
subsidiaries receive medical plan continuation coverage or the occurrence of any
other  qualifying  event that shall result in any qualified  beneficiary  of any
Seller or any subsidiary of any Seller having the right to elect COBRA to permit
Purchaser  to deliver to any such  qualified  beneficiary  appropriate  election
materials   necessary  to  commence  receipt  of  COBRA  continuation   coverage
immediately  upon the  occurrence  of such  event.  Except  with  respect to the
obligations of Purchaser  described in this Article XI,  Sellers shall be solely
responsible  for, and Sellers shall  indemnify  Purchaser  against,  any and all
Liabilities  of Sellers  which have arisen or may arise in  connection  with the
Employee  Benefit Plans,  any and all Liabilities of Sellers that have arisen or
may arise in any way from the employment by Sellers of, or the  compensation  or
benefits provided by Sellers to, any Business Employee, former Business Employee
or other  present or former  employee of Sellers,  or the  termination  thereof,
including,  without limitation,  any

<PAGE>

Liability  arising out of or  relating  to any act or  omission by Sellers,  any
violation of or non-compliance  with or obligation  arising under any applicable
Legal Requirement respecting employment and the termination thereof based on any
act  or  omission  by  Sellers,  compensation  or  benefits,  and  any  and  all
Liabilities  for  severance  pay (except as  contemplated  by Section  11.3(a)),
accrued  vacation  pay,  sick pay and other  benefits  relating to any period of
employment  with  Sellers,  whether  arising  as a  matter  of  contract,  Legal
Requirements or otherwise.

     Section 11.7. No Employee  Rights.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the
contrary  (but  subject to the  proviso  contained  in this  Section  11.7),  no
provision of this  Article XI  will create any third party  beneficiary or other
rights in any Business Employee,  former Business Employee,  or other present or
former employee  including any dependent,  survivor or beneficiary  thereof,  of
Sellers in respect of employment (or resumed  employment)  with Purchaser and no
provision  of Article XI shall  create  any such  rights in any such  persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly,  under any
employee benefit plan or arrangement  which may be established or made available
by Purchaser to the Transferred Employees; provided that the foregoing shall not
diminish or impair the rights and remedies of a  Transferred  Employee  under an
Offer Letter, which has been executed and delivered by the parties thereunder as
contemplated herein.

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                                   TERMINATION

          (b) By Purchaser  upon five (5)  Business Days notice if, at or before
     the Closing Date, satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 is
     or becomes impossible (other than through the breach by Purchaser of any of
     its  representations  or  warranties or the failure of Purchaser to perform
     any of its obligations  pursuant to this Agreement) and Purchaser shall not
     have waived such condition in writing at or before the Closing Date.

          (c) By Sellers upon five (5) Business Days notice if, at or before the
     Closing Date,  satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 7.1 is or

     their  representations  or  warranties or the failure of Sellers to perform
     any of their obligations  pursuant to this Agreement) and Sellers shall not
     have waived such condition in writing at or before the Closing Date.

     occurred:

               (i) any Seller (A) agrees in writing,  (B) publicly announces its

          similar transaction, all or a material portion of the Purchased Assets
          to Purchaser or a Third Party whether as a result of the proposal of a
          stand alone plan of reorganization or otherwise;

               (ii) the Bankruptcy Court approves an Alternative Transaction, or

          portion  of the  Purchased  Assets  which  under  this  Agreement  are
          intended to be conveyed to Purchaser;

               (iv) prior to Closing, any Seller files with the Bankruptcy Court

          approved by Purchaser;

               (v) the voluntary  dismissal or conversion of the Bankruptcy Case

     Section 12.2. Effect of Termination; Expense Reimbursement; Breakup Fee.

          (a) In the event this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to Section
     12.1, all further  obligations of the parties  hereunder  shall  terminate,
     except for the  obligations set forth in the third sentence of Section 5.2,
     the second sentence of Section  6.1(a),  the last clause of Section 6.1(b),
     this  Section  12.2  and  Article XIII  (to the  extent  applicable  to the
     aforesaid  surviving  provisions),  and except that nothing in this Section
     12.2 shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for the willful breach
     of any of the  covenants  or of any of the  representations  or  warranties
     contained in this Agreement prior to such termination.

          (b) Upon the  termination of this  Agreement  pursuant to Section 12.1
     other than pursuant to Section  12.1(c),  Purchaser may provide to Seller a
     reasonably  detailed  calculation  of the  actual  out-of-pocket  costs and
     expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable and documented fees
     and expenses of its outside  counsel)  incurred by Purchaser in  connection
     with its due diligence  investigation  of Sellers and the  negotiation  and
     execution of this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and
     thereupon Sellers shall pay Purchaser in cash an amount equal to such costs
     and expenses (the "Expense Reimbursement");  provided,  however, that in no
     event shall the Expense  Reimbursement  exceed  $3 million  less the amount
     previously  paid  pursuant to the Fee  Reimbursement  Letter as provided in
     Section 13.5.

          (c) Upon the termination of this Agreement  (i) by Sellers pursuant to
     Section  12.1(g);  or  (ii) at  a time  when  Purchaser  has the  right  to
     terminate this Agreement pursuant to (A) both Section 12.1(b) (by virtue of
     a breach  of  6.7(d)  or (e)) and  12.1(d)(vi)  or  (vii),  or  (B) Section
     12.1(d)(i)  through (v), Sellers shall  concurrently  with such termination
     pay Purchaser an amount in cash equal to $10 million (the "Breakup Fee") by
     wire transfer of immediately  available  funds to an account  designated in
     writing  by  Purchaser.  If this  Agreement  is  terminated  at a time when
     Purchaser  has the right to terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant to Section
     12.1(d)(vi)  or (vii)  (but is not  entitled  to  immediate  payment of the
     Breakup Fee) and within six months  after such  termination  Sellers  enter
     into an  agreement  with  respect  to a  Superior  Transaction,  then  upon
     consummation  of  such  Superior   Transaction   (or  a  similar   Superior
     Transaction  with the original  counterparty to such Superior  Transaction)
     whether during or after such six

<PAGE>

     month  period,  Sellers  shall pay Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the
     Breakup Fee by wire transfer of immediately  available  funds to an account
     designated in writing by Purchaser. In no event shall more than one Breakup
     Fee be payable.

          (d) Purchaser and Sellers hereby agree that the Expense  Reimbursement
     and the Breakup Fee:  (i) are not a penalty,  but rather,  are a reasonable
     estimate  of the  damages  to be  suffered  by  Purchaser  in the event the
     transactions  contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated  under the
     circumstances  set  forth  herein,  (ii) are  a  necessary  inducement  for
     Purchaser to propose the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement and
     (iii) shall  be the sole remedy of Purchaser  for breach of this  Agreement
     (other than non-payment of the Expense  Reimbursement) if this Agreement is
     terminated under circumstances where the Breakup Fee is payable.
