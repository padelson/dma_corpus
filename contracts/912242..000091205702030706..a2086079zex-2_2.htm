ARTICLE V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER AND THE SELLERS 

  

 Section 5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Partners_. As a material inducement to the Buyer and the Purchasers to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, each Partner severally, and not jointly, represents and warrants solely with respect to himself, herself or itself, to the Buyer and the Purchasers as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _Interests._ Such Partner is and will be as of the Closing Date the record and beneficial owner of the Interests set forth opposite such Seller\'s name on _Exhibit A_, except, in the case of Eastrich, which will convert on the Closing Date, immediately prior to assigning its Interest (or any 

  

    

 portion thereof) as contemplated hereby, its one-percent (1%) general
partnership interest into a one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) general
partnership interest and a nine-tenths of one percent (0.9%) limited
partnership interest. Such Interests are free and clear of any and all
Encumbrances (except for federal and state securities law restrictions
of general applicability and certain transfer restrictions in the Limited
Partnership Agreement). Such Partner\'s assignment of his, her or its
Interests as contemplated by this Agreement is in compliance with the
transfer restrictions in the Limited Partnership Agreement.

  

 (b) _Authority._ Such Partner has full authority, right, power and capability to enter into this Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of such Partner pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limitation of the foregoing, to the extent that such Partner holds any Interests that are or may be deemed to be community property, such Partner has obtained from his or her spouse, if any, all consents and approvals necessary for such Partner to legally and validly consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement and each agreement, document and instrument to be executed and delivered by such Partner pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement constitutes, or when executed and delivered will constitute, valid and binding obligations of such Partner enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as the same may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to the rules of law governing (and all limitations on) specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies. 

   

 (c) _Accredited Investor._ Each Investing Partner is, and at Closing will be, an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. 

  

  

 Section 5.2  _Representations and Warranties of the Buyer_. As a material inducement to the Company and each Partner to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, the Buyer represents and warrants to the Company and each Partner as follows: 

  

  

 (a) _SEC Documents._ Macerich has filed with the SEC each statement, report, registration statement and definitive proxy statement required to be filed with the SEC by Macerich since January 1, 2000 (collectively, the " _Macerich SEC Documents_ "). The Macerich SEC Documents constitute all of the documents required to be filed by Macerich under Section 13 or subsections (a) or (c) of Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") with the SEC through the date of this Agreement. All documents required to be filed as exhibits to the Macerich SEC Documents have been so filed, and all material contracts so filed as exhibits are in full force and effect, except those which have expired in accordance with their terms, and neither Macerich nor any subsidiary of Macerich is in default thereunder where such a default would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition or result of operations of Macerich and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of their respective filing dates, (i) the Macerich SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the Macerich SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently filed Macerich SEC Document which was filed prior to the date hereof. 

  

 (b) _Financial Information_ _._ The financial statements of Macerich, including the notes thereto, included in the Macerich SEC Documents (the " _Macerich Financial Statements_ ") were complete and correct in all material respects as of their respective dates, complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of 

  

    
  

 the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates, and were prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods
indicated and consistent with each other (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements included in quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, as permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the
SEC). The Macerich Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows of Macerich and its subsidiaries at the dates and during the periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal,
recurring year-end adjustments) and are consistent with the books and records
of Macerich and its subsidiaries.

  

 (c) Macerich (i) has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") and such election has not been terminated or revoked, (ii) has qualified for taxation as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 2001 and expects to qualify for its current taxable year, and (iii) operates, and intends to continue to operate, in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT. Each subsidiary of Macerich which is a partnership or limited liability company or files Tax Returns as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes has since its acquisition by Macerich been classified for Federal income tax purposes as a "partnership" or "disregarded" entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives an objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that 

     

 such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not
otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint
and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such party\'s agent
for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that service of process may also be
made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid

force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware.

  

 Section 8.9  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned, in whole or in part by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other party, provided that, after the Closing, any Class A Partner may assign its rights (but not its obligations) to any Affiliate thereof.

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or other Transaction Documents, all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. 

  

 Section 8.11  _Execution by Officer of the Company_. This Agreement is executed on behalf of the Company by an officer of the general partner of the Company, acting in his or her capacity as such officer, and not individually. The Buyer, the Purchasers and each other Person dealing with the Company, or claiming any rights or interests herein or hereunder, agrees to look solely to the assets of the Company for satisfaction of any obligations of the Company prior to the Closing and each such Person further agrees that no advisor, manager, employee, officer, director or agent of the Company (acting in such capacity), shall have any personal liability hereunder or otherwise. 

  

 Section 8.12  _Execution by Attorney-in-Fact of the Partners_. This Agreement (or the Joinder Agreement joining certain Partners hereto) may be executed on behalf of certain Partners by an individual representing such Partner, acting in such individual\'s capacity as such representative pursuant to a previously-granted power of attorney, and not individually (any such person in such capacity, the " _Attorney_ "). The Buyer, the Purchasers, the Company and each person dealing with the Attorney, or claiming any rights or interests herein or hereunder, agrees to look solely to the respective Partners for satisfaction of any obligations of the Attorney, and each such Person further agrees that no Attorney shall have any personal liability hereunder or otherwise.
