the Initial Closing (or, if applicable, any Subsequent Closing), the Acquired
Assets, including all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the

Exhibit 1 to Schedule 2.2(a). For the avoidance of doubt, if any Acquired
Asset is not sold, assigned, conveyed, transferred or delivered to Buyer or
its designees on the Initial Closing Date, whether pursuant to Section 2.3 or
otherwise, such Acquired Asset shall be sold, assigned, conveyed, transferred
or delivered as the same shall exist on the Subsequent Closing
Date applicable to such Acquired Asset or, in the case of an Acquired Asset
that is a Contract, as promptly as possible in accordance with the procedures
for assumption and assignment of Contracts set forth in the Sale Order;
provided, that with respect to any Acquired Asset that is subject to a right
of first refusal or other option to purchase that predates the Cases and does
not constitute a Lien of which the Acquired Assets may be sold free and
clear pursuant to the Sale Order under applicable law, and provided such
right or option is exercised, then the Acquired Assets shall include, in lieu
of such Acquired Asset, all proceeds of the sale of any such Acquired Asset
and such proceeds shall be conveyed to the Buyer as promptly as possible.  
(b) Excluded Assets. The Subject Entities and Buyer hereby acknowledge and
agree that Buyer shall not purchase, acquire or accept from the Sellers, any
of the rights properties, agreements or assets set forth in Schedule 2.2(b)
as it may be revised from time to time pursuant to Section 2.3 (such rights,
properties, agreements and assets being referred to herein, collectively, as
the "Excluded Assets").   (c) Assumed Liabilities. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Assumed Liabilities" means (i) all Liabilities of the Sellers
that are required to be performed, and that accrue, on or after the
applicable Closing Date under the Assumed Contracts and Assumed IP Licenses

Licenses prior to the applicable Closing Date), to the extent such Assumed
Contracts and Assumed IP Licenses, and all rights of the Sellers thereunder,
are effectively assigned to Buyer at such Closing, (ii) Liabilities for
accrued vacation, sick time and time-off with respect to any Transferred
Employee, as set forth in Section 8.17(c), and (iii) all Customer Account

conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (1)
Assumed Liabilities shall not include any Excluded Liabilities, and (2) Buyer
shall not be responsible for any Liabilities resulting from the ownership,
use, operation or maintenance of the Acquired Assets, or the conduct of the
Business by the Sellers, prior to the Closing.   (d) Excluded Liabilities.

not accept, assume, agree to pay, perform or otherwise discharge or satisfy

and Liability Schedules to include in or exclude from each Asset and
Liability Schedule additional assets or additional Liabilities relating to
the Business; provided, that in no event will Buyer have the right to amend
Schedule 2.2(b) to remove any item included in Part I of such Schedule
2.2(b); provided, further that no Asset and Liability Schedule may be amended
to exclude an asset (other than assets constituting "plant, property and
equipment") that was purchased at any Closing (or subsequently) or to exclude
any liability that was assumed at any Closing or subsequently. For the
avoidance of doubt, all Customer Accounts shall be Acquired Assets.
The parties agree that the Purchase Price shall not be increased, reduced
or otherwise amended on account of any election under this Section 2.3, it
being understood and agreed that the Purchase Price entitles Buyer to accept
and assume or reject such assets or liabilities of the Sellers as Buyer may
in its sole discretion determine, other than the assets and liabilities set
forth on Part I of Schedule 2.2(b). Buyer agrees that, provided that the
conditions precedent to its obligation to close have been satisfied or waived
(other than, with respect to the London Business, the receipt of all required
Regulatory Consents), it shall at its election (solely as to London, the
"London Election") either (a) acquire all of the Acquired Assets (including
all Leases) and assume the Assumed Liabilities associated with such Acquired
Assets (other than Excluded Liabilities) with respect to the London Business
and the Business in Canada and shall be responsible for all severance and
termination costs associated with such Acquired Assets, or (b) pay the Take-
or-Pay Fee with respect to such region, as set forth in Section 10.3;
provided, that Buyer shall, by notice to the Parent, make the London Election
no later than the date that is four weeks from the date hereof; provided,
further, that if Buyer elects option (a) above with respect to the London
Business and notifies the Parent of its intent that an entity other than
Buyer or its Affiliates shall be Buyer\'s designee for receipt of the
Acquired Assets relating to such business, then Buyer\'s obligation to close
on the London Business shall be tolled until (and the Drop Dead Date as to
the London Business shall become) the date that is 90 days from the date
hereof. Once any such Acquired Asset has been acquired or liability assumed,
that asset or liability cannot be transferred or otherwise conveyed back to
Sellers.   Section 2.4 Assignment of Contracts and Licenses.   (a) Subject
to the applicable provisions of the Sale Order and the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, as soon as possible (but in no event prior to
the Initial Closing Date) after any Contract (including any IP License) is
listed on Exhibit 1 to Schedule 2.2(a) (as revised from time to time pursuant
to Section 2.3), (i) the Sellers that are Debtors shall assume and assign to
Buyer or its designees, and Buyer or its designees shall take assignment of,
all of each such Seller\'s title, right and interest in and to each such
Assumed Contract, free and clear of any and all Liens and
Excluded Liabilities, and (ii) the Sellers that are not Debtors shall assign
to Buyer or its designees, and Buyer or its designees shall take assignment
of, all of each such Seller\'s title, right and interest in and to each such
Assumed Contract, free and clear of any and all Liens and Excluded
Liabilities.   (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign
any Assumed Contract or Assumed IP License if pursuant to Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code (if applicable) or other applicable law, an assignment
thereof requires the consent of a third party thereto and such consent is not
obtained at or prior to the applicable Closing, in which case the provisions
of Sections 2.7, 8.4 and 8.5(a) shall apply; provided, that (x) this sentence
shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of Section 5.5, and (y) the
Sellers shall provide to Buyer, by whatever measures are necessary, the
equivalent of the entire benefit Buyer would have realized from the
assignment of such Assumed Contract or Assumed IP License to Buyer.  
Section 2.5 Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreements. At or as of
the applicable Closing, Parent shall cause each Seller to deliver to Buyer or
its designated Affiliate a Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit D.   Section 2.6 Intellectual Property
Rights. With respect to any Acquired Asset consisting of Intellectual
Property Rights owned by the Sellers or their Affiliates that are used or
useful in the operation of the businesses of the Sellers or their Affiliates,
(a) if such Intellectual Property Rights are not substantially related or
material to the Business and are listed on Schedule 2.6 then, at the
Sellers\' option, the Sellers may retain all right, title and interest in and
to such Intellectual Property Rights and shall grant to the applicable
Purchased Entity and/or Buyer and/or one or more designees of Buyer a
transferable, royalty free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license to
use such Intellectual Property Rights in the conduct of its business, and (b)
for any Intellectual Property Rights for which the Sellers do not exercise
the right described in clause (a) or which are substantially related or
material to the Business, Buyer or the applicable Purchased Entity shall
grant the Sellers and their Affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty free,
worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license to use such Intellectual Property
Rights in the conduct of their respective businesses, but only to the extent
the conduct of such business is not prohibited by this Agreement. Such
license shall be transferable (per entire assignment in whole but not in
part) and sublicenseable on an exclusive and perpetual basis but in each case
only in connection with the divestiture, sale or transfer to a third party of
business lines or Affiliates of Parent or Sellers after the Closing Date and
only if such transferee agrees to such restriction. Any license to
Intellectual Property Rights described in this Section shall be memorialized
in a license agreement agreed upon by the parties (an "Intellectual Property
License Agreement"), which shall include other customary terms and conditions
to be agreed upon by the parties, acting reasonably and in good faith, to
include disclaimers, indemnification and liability limitations.   Section

operation of the business(es) of the Sellers and/or their Affiliates
following the Closing, and solely to the extent the conduct of such business
is expressly permitted in this Agreement, upon the Sellers\' request, Buyer

PRICE   Section 3.1 Purchase Price.   (a) In consideration for the
Securities and the other Acquired Assets and in reliance on the
representations, warranties and covenants of Parent, the Sellers and the
Purchased Entities contained herein and in the Related Documents, at or prior
to the Closing (including any Subsequent Closings) and in the manner set
forth below, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to $282,000,000
(the "Purchase Price"; such amount subject to adjustment as provided below),
of which seventy-five percent (75%) shall be paid in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by the
Sellers, and twenty-five percent (25%) shall be paid into an escrow account
(the "Escrow Account") pursuant to an escrow agreement in the form of Exhibit
E attached hereto among Buyer, the Sellers and the Escrow Agent; provided,
that if (i) Sellers shall have filed under the HSR Act by the close of
business on the date of this Agreement and satisfied their additional
conditions to be fulfilled prior to the Closing (other than the Sale Order
becoming a Final Order), and (ii) the Initial Closing Date shall not have
occurred on or prior to midnight on Monday, November 21, 2005, then the
Purchase Price shall be increased by $5,000,000.   (b) No later than the
close of business on Monday November 14, 2005, Buyer shall deposit with a
mutually agreeable escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), by certified check or
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $15 million (the
"Deposit").   (c) Subject to Section 3.2, prior to or on the
Initial Closing Date, Buyer shall wire transfer to the Sellers 75% of an
amount (the "Adjusted Purchase Price") equal to:   (i) the Purchase Price,
minus   (ii) the Segregated Account Adjustment.   (d) Subject to Section
3.2, prior to or on the Initial Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit into the
Escrow Account an amount equal to (i) 25% of the Adjusted Purchase Price,
minus (ii) the Deposit.   Section 3.2 Subsequent Closings. In the event that
the Acquired Assets are sold in more than one Closing (i.e., there are
Delayed Purchase Assets) the portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price payable
in respect of the Acquired Assets to be sold on the Initial Closing Date and
the portion payable in respect of the Acquired Assets to be sold at each
Subsequent Closing shall be equitably determined in accordance with the
guidelines set forth in Schedule 3.2 and shall be paid on the applicable
Closing Date, in each case 75% direct to the Sellers in cash as above and 25%
into the Escrow Account as above.   Section 3.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.
In the event that the Segregated Account Balance at the end of the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date on which the assets of the Company
are to be transferred, net of any transfers of deposits pending or in process
(the "Reference Segregated Account Balance") is less than $1,750,000,000, the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to (a) $1,750,000,000
minus the Reference Segregated Account Balance, divided by (b)
$1,750,000,000, multiplied by (c) the Purchase Price (such amount the
"Segregated Account Adjustment").   Section 3.4 Pre-Closing Price
Adjustments. On the Business Day immediately prior to the applicable Closing
Date (including any applicable Subsequent Closing Dates), the President or
Chief Financial Officer of the Company shall deliver to Buyer no later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, a certificate (the "Purchase Price Adjustment
Certificate") setting forth (a) the Company\'s good faith estimated
calculation as of such Closing Date of the Segregated Account Balance on such
Closing Date (the "Segregated Account Estimate"), and (b) an estimated
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Sellers\' Price Estimate").
Following the delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate to Buyer,
the Sellers and Buyer shall discuss the Segregated Account Estimate and the
Sellers\' Price Estimate and endeavor to resolve any differences. In the
event of any disagreement as to any of the items estimated in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate or the calculation of the Adjusted Purchase
Price, Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers Buyer\'s good faith estimate as of
such Closing Date of the Segregated Account Balance of the applicable
Person(s) and a calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the "Buyer\'s
Price Estimate") and shall pay to the Sellers in accordance with Sections 3.1
or 3.2, as applicable, an amount equal to Buyer\'s Price Estimate (or the
applicable portion thereof) and shall deposit the difference
between Sellers\' Price Estimate and Buyer\'s Price Estimate in a separate
escrow account established specifically for such purpose.   Section 3.5
Post-Closing Adjustments.   (a) No later than the later of (i) the 20th day
following the end of the calendar month in which the applicable Closing
occurs and (ii) 30th day following such Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Company, a report of the successor in interest to the Company
with respect to the Customer Accounts purchased from the Company as of such
Closing Date (such report, the "Closing Report"), together with a statement
(the "Closing Statement") setting forth Buyer\'s calculation as of such
Closing Date of the Segregated Account Balance and a determination of the
amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price. Buyer will prepare the Closing Report
and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) in
accordance with Section 3.5(e). In the event Buyer shall fail to deliver the
Closing Report and the Closing Statement within such 30-day period, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate will be treated as the Closing
Statement for purposes of Section 3.1 or 3.2, as applicable.   (b) During
the 20-day period immediately following the Company\'s receipt of the Closing
Report and the Closing Statement, the Company and its representatives (i)
will be permitted to review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, the applicable successor\'s books and records and the working papers
related to the preparation of the Closing Report and the Closing Statement
(including the determinations included therein), and (ii) will be given
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,
to knowledgeable employees and accounting professionals of Buyer in order to
facilitate the Company\'s review of the Closing Report and the Closing
Statement; provided, however, that the review and access described in clauses
(i) and (ii) will be conducted at times and in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Buyer\'s or any of its
Affiliates\' businesses. The Closing Report and the Closing Statement
(including the determinations included therein) will become final, binding
and conclusive upon Buyer and the Sellers (a) on the 20th day following the
Company\'s receipt thereof, unless Buyer receives from the Company prior to
such 20th day, written notice of the Sellers\' disagreement (a "Dispute
Notice") with any account or determination set forth in the Closing Report or
the Closing Statement or (b) on such earlier date as the Company notifies
Buyer that it does not dispute the Closing Report and Closing Statement. Any
Dispute Notice will specify in reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount
of any disagreement so asserted (collectively, the "Disputed Items"). Any
account or determination set forth or reflected on the Closing Report or the
Closing Statement that is not specifically objected to in the Dispute Notice
will be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer and the Sellers upon
delivery of the Dispute Notice. If Company timely delivers a Dispute Notice,
then the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price (in accordance with the
resolution described in clause (x) or (y) below, as applicable) will become
final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer and the Sellers on the first to
occur of (x) the date on which Buyer and the Company resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y) the date on
which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by the Buyer and the
Company in writing are finally resolved in writing by the Independent
Accountants in accordance with Section 3.5(c).   (c) During the 15 days
following delivery of a Dispute Notice, Buyer and the Company will seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they have with respect
to all of the Disputed Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing by Buyer
and Company will be deemed final, binding and conclusive on Buyer and the
Sellers. If Buyer and Company do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed
Items during such 15-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually
agree), then at the end of such 15-day (or longer) period Buyer and Company
will submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the "Unresolved
Items") to one of the "big four" nationally recognized firms of independent
certified public accountants with a nationwide audit and accounting practice
as Buyer and Company may mutually agree (the "Independent Accountants") to
review and resolve such matters. The Independent Accountants will determine
each Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not be more favorable to Buyer
than the related amount reflected in the Closing Statement nor more favorable
to the Sellers than the related amount set forth in the Dispute Notice) in
accordance with Section 3.5(e) as promptly as may be reasonably practicable,
and Buyer and Company will instruct the Independent Accountants to endeavor
to complete such process within a period of no more than 15 days. The
Independent Accountants may conduct such proceedings as the Independent
Accountants believe, in their sole discretion, will assist in
the determination of the Unresolved Items; provided, however, that, except as
Buyer and Company may otherwise agree, all communications between Buyer,
Company and the Sellers or any of their respective representatives, on the
one hand, and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in
writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party.
The Independent Accountants\' determination of the Unresolved Items will be
final, binding and conclusive on Buyer and the Sellers, effective as of the
date the Independent Accountants\' written determination is received by Buyer
and Company. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants will be
borne one-half by Buyer and one-half jointly by the Sellers, and each of
Buyer and the Sellers will bear its own legal, accounting and other fees and
expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure.   (d) Upon
final determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5(b)
or (c) (the "Final Purchase Price"), an adjustment to the Purchase Price will
be determined and paid as follows:   (i) If the Estimated Purchase Price
exceeds the Final Purchase Price, the Sellers (or their respective successors
and assigns, including any post-consummation trusts formed to administer
claims against the Debtors\' estate) shall within five (5) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Purchase Price pay to Buyer the amount of such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Buyer. Seller\'s obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall constitute superpriority administrative claims and shall be secured by
liens having the priority contemplated by Section 11.2 of this Agreement.  
(ii) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer
shall within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final
Purchase Price pay the amount of such excess by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, 75% to the Sellers and 25% to the Escrow Account, as
above.   (e) For the purposes of this Section 3.5, each accounting term
used herein will have the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with
Regulatory Accounting Standards and, to the extent consistent with Regulatory
Accounting Standards, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and
methodologies applied in preparing the Latest Regulatory Statements. Each
account included in the Closing Statement and the Closing Report will be
consistent with the books and records of the Broker Entities and the
definitions herein agreed; provided, that in no event shall any
Excluded Liability be included on the Closing Report.     ARTICLE IV

None of Parent or the Sellers will (and Parent and the Sellers will cause
each of their Subsidiaries, respective officers, directors, Representatives
not to) disclose to any third party any of the Confidential Information and
Parent and the Sellers will (and Parent and the Sellers will cause each of

Information relates to the ongoing business of the Debtors, subject to
compliance with the confidentiality provisions contained herein and the
restrictions contained in Section 8.18, the foregoing restrictions on use and
requirements for delivery or destruction will not apply. In the event
that any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (or any
officer, director or Representative thereof) is requested or required (by
oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, such Person will (i)
notify Buyer promptly in writing of the request or requirement prior to any
such disclosure so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or
other confidential treatment or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 8.5, (ii) cooperate with Buyer to obtain any such protective order or
other confidential treatment, and (iii) disclose only that information
strictly required.   (c) The parties acknowledge that Parent and Buyer
previously executed a confidentiality agreement dated October 25, 2005 (as

which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
until completion of the Closing, at which time the obligations of Buyer
thereunder shall terminate.   (d) Sellers shall post such collateral or
other security as may be required from time to time by the Bankruptcy Court,
the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or any other governmental or non-
governmental authority with appropriate jurisdiction in order to permit the

or notification with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent permitted by law. If any party or Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Government Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, then such party will use its reasonable efforts to make,
or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such
request. Each party shall pay 50% of all filing fees associated with any
filings made in connection with this Section 8.8.   Section 8.9 Rejected
Contracts and Licenses. The Sellers shall not (and Parent shall cause its

or Assumed IP License, or (b) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms.   Section 8.10 Post-Closing Access to Records and Personnel.
Buyer hereby acknowledges that it shall grant to the Sellers, from and after
the Closing Date reasonable access upon prior written notice, to any
records related to any Seller\'s operation of the Business prior to the

Buyer\'s or any of its Affiliates\' Business.   Section 8.11 Intellectual
Property. After the Initial Closing, upon the request of Buyer, Parent, the
Sellers and their Affiliates:   (a) shall cease to use the Mark "REFCO" or
any derivative or combination thereof, or any Mark confusingly similar

Business or any derivative or combination thereof (the "Business Marks"),
including in any proceeding in any Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that,
effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and the Purchased Entities hereby
grant to those Sellers and their Affiliates that use the REFCO Mark and the
Business Marks as of the date hereof a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive
license to (1) continue to use the REFCO Mark and the Business Marks as used
as of the date hereof until 90 days after the Initial Closing; and (ii)
continue to use REFCO Mark and the Business Marks in connection with the
wind-down of the business pursuant to any current or future proceeding in any
Bankruptcy Court until the conclusions of any such proceedings.   (b) to
the extent such Person is a Debtor, shall reject pursuant to Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise any licenses, sublicenses or any other
Contract relating to or in any way affecting (a) the REFCO Mark or the

than 5:00 p.m., New York Time, on each Business Day a statement that sets
forth an estimate of the Segregated Account Balances and Statutory Capital

basis consistent with prior practice of each of the Broker Entities
throughout the periods covered thereby (including, without limitation, the
maintenance and establishment of appropriate reserves for doubtful accounts),
and shall be consistent with the books and records of each of the Broker
Entities, as applicable.   Section 8.13 Service. Each of Parent, the
applicable Sellers and the Purchased Entities shall (and Parent shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) timely serve notice of the Sale Motion and the Sale
Notice (as defined in the Bid Procedures Order) on all Persons legally
entitled to such notices and in a manner otherwise consistent with applicable
Law.   Section 8.14 U.S. Tax Classification of the Purchased
Entities. Schedule 8.14 lists current classification of each Purchased Entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7701 of the Code and
regulations thereunder and indicates whether such classification is other

the extent that the Sellers would otherwise be liable to indemnify against or
otherwise discharge Taxes of a Purchased Entity under this Agreement or the
Sellers have agreed on or before the Closing Date to surrender a specific
amount of losses (even if such amount is provisional) under a pre-existing
contractual arrangement, the Sellers shall and shall procure that their
Affiliates shall cooperate fully in surrendering to the Purchased Entities
all group relief and consortium relief amounts, up to the amount for which
the Sellers would otherwise be liable or which has been agreed to be
surrendered, that such Purchased Entities are entitled to claim in accordance
with the ICTA.   Section 8.16 Document Preservation. From the date hereof
until the seventh anniversary of the Initial Closing Date each of Parent and
the Purchased Entities shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to maintain all books of account, financial records, minute books and all
other records of or related to the Business prior to the Closing
(including electronic files and correspondence) and shall not engage in the
destruction of any such documents or issue any directive or request
recommending or requiring such destruction.   Section 8.17 Employees.  
(a) Buyer has delivered to Parent a schedule setting forth those categories
of individuals whom Buyer has designated as continuing employees of the
Business (the "Business Employees"). On and as of the applicable Closing
Date, employees of Refco Canada, Refco Singapore and the London Business who
are employed in the Business shall also be Business Employees. The parties
hereto intend that there will be continuity of employment for all Business
Employees following the applicable Closing Date. In order to effectuate such
transfer of employment as of such Closing Date, except as otherwise provided
herein, Buyer shall make a general offer of employment through a general
notice of transfer to each Business Employee who is not an employee of a
Purchased Entity (each an "Offer Employee"). Such general offer of employment
will be deemed accepted by each Offer Employee unless (i) expressly rejected
by the Offer Employee prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the Offer Employee
otherwise indicates by his or her actions that such offer of employment has
not been accepted (each Offer Employee who acts under (i) or (ii), a "Non-
Acceptance Offer Employee"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Transferred
Employee" shall mean each Offer Employee other than a Non-Acceptance Offer
Employee; provided that, in the case of Offer Employees on short term
disability or other approved leaves of absence, such employees must commence
service with Buyer prior to the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date to
become Transferred Employees. Any Business Employee who does not commence
employment with Buyer as described above shall not be treated as
a Transferred Employee. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.17,
all Transferred Employees will cease to accrue benefits under and cease
to participate as active participants in all Employee Benefit Plans as of
the Closing Date and the Purchased Entities shall withdraw as
participating employers from each Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing
Date. The parties will cooperate to comply with legal and regulatory
requirements to accomplish the employment transfers described in this Section
8.17, including without limitation any requirements for Parent to terminate
the employment of any Business Employee and for Buyer to make a specific
employment offer to such Business Employees, and Parent will transfer any
work permits or passes applicable to the Business Employees.   (b) For the
one year period following the Closing, Buyer shall provide to Transferred
Employees compensation and employee benefits comparable, in the aggregate, to
the compensation and employee benefits provided by Sellers (or their
Affiliates, as the case may be) to Transferred Employees as of immediately
prior to the Closing. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.17 or
under the terms of any employee benefit plans of Buyer providing benefits to
Transferred Employees (the "Buyer Benefit Plans") or applicable Law, Buyer
shall be entitled to modify, amend, suspend, terminate or supplement any
Buyer Benefit Plans in its sole discretion.   (c) The Buyer Benefit Plans
shall credit such Transferred Employees (and their dependents) for any
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid under the applicable Employee
Benefit Plans in the year of initial participation in the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plans that are group health plans (within the meaning of Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code). Buyer shall provide each Transferred Employee with
credit for the same number of vacation and sickness benefit days he or she
has accrued but not used in the calendar year in which the Closing occurs,
provided, that, to the extent required by law, such amount shall be paid by
Buyer in cash.   (d) Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee who is
a participant in the Refco Group, Ltd. Employee Savings Plan (the "Seller
401(k) Plan"), and who elects to transfer his or her account balance under
the Seller 401(k) Plan, to roll over his or her account balance (including
any outstanding loans thereunder) to the Man Group USA Inc Savings and
Investment Plan (the "Buyer Qualified Plan"), as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Buyer
Qualified Plan. Parent agrees to use and to cause the Purchased Entities and
the Sellers to use their best efforts to cooperate with Buyer, its agents and
designees to ensure a smooth transfer of accounts, records and recordkeeping
to effect the transfers described in the previous sentence. Parent further
agrees to take and to cause the Sellers and Purchased Entities to take such
actions as are necessary, including securing the cooperation of the
recordkeeper, trustee and other service providers of Seller 401(k) Plan, to
effect such transfers.   (e) Buyer will pay and provide to Transferred
Employees whose employment terminates on or within twelve months after the
Closing severance benefits under conditions and in amounts that are no less
favorable to the employee than those provided to Transferred Employees as of
immediately prior to the Closing under Parent\'s (or Parent\'s Affiliate\'s)
severance policies; provided, that such amounts shall be without duplication
of any severance payments required to be made by applicable law. Solely for
purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the
Buyer severance plans (and not for any other purpose), Buyer shall credit
each Transferred Employee with his or her years of service with the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates, and any predecessor entities, to the same
extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled to credit for such service
under any similar Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Transferred Employee\'s
commencement of participation in the Buyer Benefit Plan, except that
Transferred Employees shall receive no such credit to the extent that such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits.   (f) Parent shall retain
or assume liability for all claims under any welfare benefit plan ("Welfare
Plan") as such term is defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates which are incurred by any
Transferred Employees prior to or on the date that such Transferred Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee and any other current or former employee of
Parent (and covered dependents and COBRA beneficiaries). Buyer shall assume
liability for all claims under Welfare Plans which are incurred by
Transferred Employees (and their covered dependents and COBRA beneficiaries)
after that date. For purposes of this paragraph, the following welfare
benefit claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (a) life,
accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident
insurance benefits, upon the death or accident giving rise to such benefits;
(b) health, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (included in health
benefits), upon the provision of services, materials or supplies relating to
such claim; and (c) short-term disability and long-term disability benefits,
upon the date on which an individual becomes disabled under the applicable
disability plan.   Section 8.18 Non-Compete and Wind Down. The Subject
Entities agree that following the final Closing Date until the fifth
anniversary of the final Closing Date, except as required to provide services
to Buyer or its designee under the Transition Services Agreement, the Subject
Entities shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to (i)
directly or indirectly, operate, perform, control or engage in, manage or own
a greater than 5% ownership in a business or Person that conducts any
activities in competition with the Business, (ii) solicit, raid or knowingly
entice, encourage or induce any Person that currently or at any time prior to
or during the five year non-competition period is or was a client or customer
(or is actively pursued as a potential client or customer) of any portion of
the Business for activities which are the same as or competitive with the
operation of the Business, (iii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to
disrupt, any relationship, contractual or otherwise, between the Business or
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective clients or
customers, or (iv) cause or authorize any third party controlled by the
Sellers to take any of the action described above. In addition, promptly
after the Initial Closing, the Subject Entities, upon the request of Buyer,
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Sellers\' businesses
(other than those businesses constituting Excluded Assets) to cease
operations and wind down, including by terminating any and all Permits or IP
Licenses other than those which are or may still become Assumed Contracts or
Assumed IP Licenses pursuant to Section 2.3.   Section 8.19 Additional
Sellers. Parent shall cause each of its Affiliates owning any Acquired Asset
to execute a joinder to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, as a "Seller" hereunder and to have all of the
obligations and rights of a Seller hereunder as if such entity had executed
this Agreement on the date hereof.   Section 8.20 Operations. Parent and the
Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, take all
actions necessary to continue the operation and performance in a manner
consistent with past practice of the data processing, information technology,
risk analysis and other operations currently conducted by the Sellers,
including operations conducted at Sellers\' office located in Memphis,
Tennessee.   Section 8.21 Agent for Excepted Accounts. From and after the
Initial Closing, Buyer shall serve as the agent of the Sellers for purposes
of administering the Excepted Accounts acquired by Buyer, which will
include resolving, closing, liquidating, transferring or otherwise disposing
of the Excepted Accounts and collecting and remitting within three (3) days
after collection (subject to the terms of this Section 8.21) to the
appropriate Sellers all amounts owed by customers in respect thereof in
excess of amounts required to close out such accounts with no loss. All risk
and benefit with respect to the Excepted Accounts shall be and remain for the
account of the Sellers and Sellers shall pay (or reimburse to Buyer as a
superpriority administrative claim and lien) all reasonable out of pocket
expenses (but not a fee for agency services provided) associated with the
administration by Buyer of the Excepted Accounts (including, without
limitation, the expenses of counsel, it being understood and agreed that
Buyer shall have not bring suit, in its own name or the name of any Seller,
in conjunction with the collection or liquidation of any Excepted Account and
Seller shall have the right to bring such suit, but only in its own name.).
Buyer shall not settle or compromise any claim against any customer without
the consent of the applicable Seller. In its capacity as administrative agent
for the Sellers, Buyer shall take such steps, not inconsistent with the
foregoing, as Parent or the applicable Seller may instruct from time to time;
provided, (i) that such instruction shall not be in contravention of any
applicable law, regulation or other order, directive or request of the CFTC,
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Monetary Authority of Singapore or other
applicable governmental or non-governmental authority or any interpretation
thereof; (ii) that Sellers acknowledge that Buyer may transfer any Excepted
Account and the rights and obligations of Buyer in respect thereof, including
Buyer\'s interest in the applicable portion of the Excepted Account Escrow,
to an appropriate third party selected by Buyer which has assumed the
obligations of Buyer hereunder with respect to such account, with Parent\'s
or the applicable Seller\'s consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld; and (iii) that Buyer acknowledges that Sellers may direct Buyer to
transfer any Excepted Account and the rights and obligations of Buyer in
respect thereof to an appropriate third party which has assumed
the obligations of Buyer hereunder with respect to such account, without
any requirement of Buyer consent to such transfer. In connection with any
transfer under either clause (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, the
Excepted Account Escrow balance applicable to the account so transferred
shall be released to (a) the transferee, in the case of a transfer under
clause (ii), or (b) the applicable Seller, in the case of a transfer under
clause (iii), but in each case solely to the extent that Buyer shall be
released of any liability with respect to such account upon such transfer. On
or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the applicable Sellers shall establish
a separate escrow account (the "Excepted Account Escrow") into which account
such Sellers shall deposit and in which account such Sellers shall at all
times maintain liquid funds equal to at least the sum of (x) to the extent
such amounts have not previously been deposited in the applicable Customer
Accounts, the aggregate deficit of all Deficit Accounts that are Excepted
Accounts, as calculated in accordance with the daily segregated funds
computation as of the close of business on the day of determination, it being
agreed that Sellers shall not take any action outside the ordinary course of
business to withdraw assets from Customer Accounts in contemplation of
Closing, (y) to the extent such amounts have not previously been deposited in
the applicable Customer Accounts, the aggregate margin necessary to render
all Undermargined Accounts that are Excepted Accounts no longer Undermargined
Accounts, such margin amount to be determined by reference to applicable
exchange minimums as in effect from time to time and (z) $12,000,000. Buyer
shall have the right to direct the application of funds from the Excepted
Account Escrow to such Excepted Accounts to cover any additional deficit or
under-margin amounts in accordance with exchange minimums in effect from time
to time or to satisfy any indemnity liability of the Sellers to Buyer in
respect of the Excepted Accounts (notwithstanding any other limitation herein
with respect to the source of funds for the Sellers\' indemnity obligations).
The $12,000,000 additional escrow will be remitted back to Seller in the
proportion of collected Excepted Accounts to total Excepted Accounts (line
9A, CFTC Form-1FR-FCM) as of the Closing Date. Any dispute with respect to
the Excepted Accounts and/or any instruction given pursuant to this Section
8.21 shall be subject to resolution by the Bankruptcy Court. Buyer and the
Sellers agree that it is their shared intention that the Excepted Accounts be
collected, liquidated or otherwise resolved in a prompt and prudent
manner, taking into account the likelihood that any deficit or under-
margin circumstance will be resolved by the client in a timely manner in the
ordinary course of business.   Section 8.22 Personally Identifiable
Information. Buyer shall adopt the Debtors\' privacy policies with respect to
personally identifiable information (as such term is defined in section
101(41A) of the Bankruptcy Code) of the Debtors\' customers whose Customer
Accounts are conveyed to Buyer.    ARTICLE IX  CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS

Sellers may retain copies of any such electronic records (i) to the extent
relating to the operation of the businesses of the Sellers or their
Affiliates as contemplated to be conducted after the Closing, (ii) to the
extent necessary to provide Transition Services, or (iii) to the extent
required for regulatory or reporting purposes. Such electronic records shall
be provided in the format then maintained by the Sellers or their Affiliates,
provided that Buyer may request that the Sellers, at Buyer\'s cost and
expense, convert such electronic data to a format reasonably requested by
Buyer.   (h) Sale Order of Parent. The Sale Order of the Parent and the
Debtors as of the dater hereof shall be a Final Order or Final Orders entered

sole discretion that provides inter alia the following with
such modifications as may be approved by Buyer:   (i) Specific findings of

its Affiliates, members or shareholders or the Purchased Entities or the

for the Acquired Assets;   (I) Neither Buyer nor the Debtors are entering
into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement fraudulently;   (J)

Liabilities, and (b) this Agreement and the transactions and instruments

and authorizing the Debtors to enter into the Transition Service Agreement
and any other agreements, licenses or contracts contemplated hereby and take
all other and further actions necessary to implement the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;   (J) (1) Obligating the Sellers to pay all
Cure Amounts relative to the Contracts to be assigned on any Closing Date

Amounts, and (2) enjoining and forever barring the non-Seller party or
parties to each Assumed Contract which is to be assigned on any Closing Date
from asserting against Buyer, and of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired
Assets: (i) any default existing as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any
objection to the assumption and assignment of such non-Seller party\'s
Assumed Contract.   (i) Sale Order of Company. In addition to the provisions

Case of the Company shall provide that the indemnity claims of Buyer shall
have the status and priority set forth in the last proviso of Section 11.2
hereof.   (j) Price Certification Certificate. The Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer the Price Certification Certificate.   For avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge that Buyer\'s knowledge of the existence of any facts,

jointly, in a written agreement executed by all such parties;   (b) Upon
written notice, by either Buyer or the Sellers, if the Initial Closing shall
not have occurred on or before December 6, 2005 (the "Drop Dead Date");
provided, however, that, if the Initial Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the Drop Dead Date due to a material breach of this Agreement by Buyer
or the Sellers, the breaching party may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.1(b); provided further that Buyer or Sellers may elect to
extend the Drop Dead Date for an additional period of up to thirty (30) days
in the event that any Required Consents have not been obtained prior to the
Drop Dead Date; provided, further, that if, but only if, the Initial Closing
with respect to a portion of the Acquired Assets shall have occurred during
such thirty (30) day period, Buyer or Sellers may elect to further extend the
Drop Dead Date for an additional period of up to sixty (60) days in the event
that any Required Consents have not been obtained prior to the expiration of
such thirty (30) day period;   (c) By Buyer, upon written notice to the
Sellers, if Buyer has previously provided the Sellers written notice of any
material inaccuracy in or material breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Article V, or a failure to perform or comply in any material
respect with any covenant or obligation of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement or the Related Documents, and the Sellers have failed, within two
(2) days after the date of such notice, to properly remedy such inaccuracy or
to perform or comply with such covenant or obligation or provide reasonably
adequate assurance as to the Sellers\' ability to promptly remedy such
inaccuracy or perform or comply with such covenant; provided, however, that
Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

condition contained in Section 9.2(a) or 9.2(b) to be satisfied;   (d) By
Buyer, upon written notice to the Sellers, if (i) the Bid Procedures Order is
stayed, reversed, amended or vacated, (ii) the Sale Order has not been

Closing Date, Debtors\' chapter 11 cases are converted to a case under
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, a trustee or examiner with expanded powers
is appointed in the Debtors\' chapter 11 case or the Debtors\' chapter
11 case is dismissed or if a motion is filed seeking any of the
foregoing;   (e) By Buyer, upon written notice to the Sellers, if
any regulatory action shall be taken against any of the Purchased Entities,
the Sellers or the Business that has had or could, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
or   (f) By the Sellers, by written notice to Buyer, if the Sellers have
previously provided Buyer written notice of any material inaccuracy in or
material breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article VII,
or a failure to perform or comply in any material respect with any covenant
or obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the Related Documents,
and Buyer has failed, within two (2) days after the date of such notice, to
properly remedy such inaccuracy or to perform or comply with such covenant or
obligation or provide reasonably adequate assurance as to Buyer\'s ability to
promptly remedy such inaccuracy or perform or comply with such covenant;
provided, however, that the Sellers shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 10.1(f) if any Seller is then in material
breach of this Agreement or if the breach or breaches by the Buyer would not
result in the failure of the condition contained in Section 9.3(a) or 9.3(b)
to be satisfied.   Section 10.2 Liabilities in Event of Termination. In the
event of any termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party specifying the
provision hereof pursuant to which any such termination is made, this
Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and
effect, and there shall be no Liability on the part of Buyer or the Sellers,
except that the obligations of the Sellers and Buyer under this Article X and
the last sentence of Section 8.3(a) shall remain in full force and
effect.   Section 10.3 Termination by Reason of Buyer Failure to Close. If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(f), the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall be
strictly limited to retention of the Securities, the Acquired Assets that are
not conveyed and paid for, the Deposit and additional cash in an amount equal
to $43 million (payable on demand), which shall in such case constitute
liquidated damages in respect of Buyer\'s breach of or failure to close on
this Agreement (the "Seller Liquidated Damages"); provided, that as long as
the Initial Closing has taken place the Seller Liquidated Damages shall be
reduced by (a) $37 million on the Closing Date upon which the Acquired Assets
of the London Business are sold to Buyer or the London Take or Pay Fee (as
defined below) is paid, (b) $13 million on the Closing Date upon which the
Acquired Assets of Refco Canada are sold to Buyer or the Canada Take or Pay

complete the purchase of such assets have been satisfied or waived by Buyer,
other than the receipt of required Regulatory Consents, but Buyer has not
purchased all Acquired Assets of the London Business and offered employment
to substantially all employees in the United Kingdom, Buyer shall pay $37
million to Sellers (the "London Take or Pay Fee"), (b) all

Pay Fee"); provided, that the London Take or Pay Fee shall in no event be due
prior to the Drop Dead Date with respect to the London Business unless the
applicable Regulatory Consents have been received. In no event shall Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or representatives have any Liability to Parent, the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates or any other Person hereunder in
excess of the applicable Seller Liquidated Damages, and any claim, right or
cause of action (including any claim, right or cause of action for willful
breach of this Agreement) by Parent, the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates or any other Person against Buyer or its Affiliates or

waived, released and forever discharged. In no event shall Buyer or its
Affiliates have any Liability to Parent, the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates or any other Person for any special, consequential or punitive
damages, and any such claim, right or cause of action for any damages that

Agreement is hereby fully waived, released and forever discharged.   
ARTICLE XI  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 11.1 Survival.   (a) The respective
representations and warranties of the parties contained herein and in any
other agreement, certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant
hereto shall survive the Closing (or, in the case of any Acquired Assets
acquired following the Closing Date, the Subsequent Closing Date) until a
date 12 months from the Closing Date (and, in the case of any Acquired Assets
acquired following the Closing Date, 12 months following the Subsequent
Closing Date on which such asset was acquired); provided,
that representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.2, 5.9, 5.13,
5.14 and Article I shall survive until the earlier of 60 days after the lapse
of the applicable statute of limitations and the effective date of the plan
of reorganization of the Debtors. No Claim may be asserted nor may any action
be commenced against the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.2(a) unless written
notice of such action is received by Parent on or prior to the date on which
the representation or warranty is based ceases to survive as set forth in the
prior sentence (it being agreed and understood that if a claim for a breach
of representation or warranty is timely made, the representation or
warranty shall, solely for purposes of such claim, survive until the date on
which such claim is finally liquidated or otherwise resolved). No other Claim
with respect to the representations and warranties may be asserted nor may
any action be commenced against the Sellers pursuant to Section 11.2 unless
written notice of such action is received by Parent on or prior to the
relevant date described above.   (b) Except as otherwise provided herein,
the respective covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement, or in
any Related Documents shall survive the Closing indefinitely.   Section
11.2 Indemnification of Buyer by the Sellers.   (a) On and after the Closing
Date, and notwithstanding any disclosure in this Agreement or Buyer\'s
knowledge thereof or otherwise, the Sellers and their respective successors
and assigns, including, but not limited to, any pre- or post-consummation
trusts formed to administer claims against the Debtors\' estate, shall,
jointly and severally, indemnify, save, hold harmless, discharge and release
each of the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any and all claims, demands,
suits, actions, causes of actions, losses (including, for avoidance of doubt,
loss of profits), costs, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys\' fees (including such fees
which are incurred in connection with a dispute of the provisions of this
Agreement), fines, penalties, costs of investigation or settlement, other
professionals\' and experts\' fees, and court or arbitration costs (but
specifically excluding punitive damages and exemplary damages except to the
extent (i) such damages specifically excluded herein are included and awarded
to a third party or (ii) such damages are incurred as a result of fraud)
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Damages"), to the extent such
Damages are determined to have arisen out of or to have resulted from, in
connection with, or by virtue of (a) any facts or circumstances
that constitute an inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, default in, or
failure to perform, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given
or made by the Purchased Entities or the Sellers in this Agreement or in any
of the certificates or other instruments or documents furnished by or on
behalf of the Purchased Entities or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement at
or prior to the Closing Date, including the covenant of the Sellers to
deliver the Acquired Assets in consideration of the Purchase Price; provided,
that for purposes of determining whether there has been any Company Breach
(as defined), any knowledge qualification shall be disregarded, (b) any
inaccuracy, error or omission in any of the books of account and other
financial records of the Purchased Entities and the Sellers, (c) any legal,
regulatory, investigative or similar proceedings relating to any pre-closing
action, activity, occurrence, fact or event, (d) any Liability (i) arising
from or attributable to the actions, failure to act, or profit or performance
of or by a Person other than a Purchased Entity for which a Purchased Entity
may otherwise be joint and severally liable under applicable common or
statutory law or regulation, including applicable tax or environmental law,
and (ii) for which any Purchased Entity is secondarily liable as a guarantor
or surety to the extent Parent or any Affiliate of Parent is primarily liable
for such Liability, (e) any Excluded Liabilities and (f) any Liability
arising from or attributable to the Excepted Accounts, the agreements
governing such Excepted Accounts or the customers with respect thereto other
than any Liability arising from misconduct of Buyer (collectively, "Company
Breaches"). All payments under this Article XI shall be treated for Tax
purposes as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither Parent nor the Sellers shall have any indemnification obligations
hereunder to any Buyer Indemnitee unless and until the total amount of
Damages for all Claims for which Buyer Indemnitees are indemnified
hereunder exceeds $1,000,000. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow
Amount is the sole source of funding for any Claims for indemnification for
the Buyer Indemnitees and under no circumstances shall any Buyer Indemnitees
be entitled to be indemnified to the extent the Damages exceed the Escrow
Amount, except to the extent such Damages (other than punitive damages) are
incurred as a result of fraud in connection with or willful breach of this
agreement. Buyer\'s Indemnitees are hereby granted a superpriority lien
pursuant to Section 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code on all assets of the
Debtors, as well as a superpriority administrative claim against the estates
of the Debtors, which superpriority lien and superpriority claim shall
(except as hereinafter provided) be senior and prior to all liens created on
property of the Debtors after the date hereof and all expenses of
administration of the Debtors under Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code;
provided, however, that such superpriority liens and claims shall be subject
and subordinate to (i) all valid and perfected Liens existing on the date of
commencement of the Cases and the claims secured thereby, as well as any
Liens and claims provided as adequate protection therefor, including, without
limitation, the Liens and claims of the Debtor\'s pre-petition lending group
and (ii) any post-petition financing providing new funds to the Debtors;
provided, further, that if the Sale Order of the Company provides that
Buyer\'s indemnities are granted a super-priority lien pursuant to section
364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code on all of the assets of the Company, as well as
a super-priority administrative claim against the estate of the Company,
which lien and claim shall not be junior to any lien or claim against the
Company, then the aggregate amount of Buyer\'s indemnities over and above the
Escrow Amount shall be limited to the sum of (x) the Purchase Price, to
the extent paid, (y) the $58,000,0000 sum of the Take or Pay Fees provided
for in Section 10.3 and (z) an additional $100,000,000 estimate of the
aggregate amount of absolute and contingent Assumed Liabilities (it being
understood that Sellers shall have the right to seek a further determination
from the Bankruptcy Court as to the actual amount of such Assumed
Liabilities, which shall be used instead of such estimate for this purpose if
such actual amount is determined by the Court to be less than such estimate).
For avoidance of doubt, any superpriority granted pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be without prejudice to the priority of the prepetition liens
and claims of the prepetition lenders to the Parent in respect of their
borrowers, their guarantors or the properties of the respective estates of
their borrowers or guarantors, as set forth in the proviso to the second
sentence of paragraph 26 of the Sale Order entered in the Case of the
Parent.   (b) Damages in respect of any breach or violation of
this Agreement shall be determined and computed in accordance with
ordinary principles of contract law as applied in the courts of the State of
New York.   Section 11.3 Notice of Claim.   (a) As used herein, the term
"Claim" means a claim for indemnification by Buyer or any other Buyer
Indemnitee for Damages under this Article XI. Any Buyer Indemnitee may give
notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for
Damages incurred by any other Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to written notice of
such Claim executed by Buyer (a "Notice of Claim") and delivered to the
Sellers (such receiving party, the "Indemnitor"), after such Buyer Indemnitee
becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim for indemnification
under this Section 11.3 arising out of or resulting from any item indemnified
pursuant to the terms of Section 11.2.   (b) No delay on the part of any
Buyer Indemnitee in giving a Notice of Claim shall limit or reduce such
Person\'s right to indemnity hereunder, or relieve the Indemnitor from any of
its obligations under this Section 11.3, unless (and then only to the extent
that) the Indemnitor is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.  
Section 11.4 Resolution of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim given by any
Buyer Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows:   (a) Admitted Claims. If,
within 20 Business Days after a Notice of Claim is delivered to the
Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing that liability for such Claim is
indemnified under Article XI the full amount of the Damages specified in the
Notice of Claim is agreed to, and that such Notice of Claim is timely, the
Indemnitor shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by
the Buyer Indemnitee of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of
Claim in accordance with this Section 11.4(a).   (b) Contested Claims. If
the Indemnitor does not agree in writing to such Notice of Claim or gives the
Buyer Indemnitee written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of
Claim (a "Contested Claim") within the 20 Business Day period specified in
Section 11.4(a), then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a
written settlement agreement executed by Buyer and Parent or (ii) in the
absence of such a written settlement agreement, all Claims shall be resolved
by the Bankruptcy Court as a section 101(5) claim against the Debtors\'
estates or a court of competent jurisdiction.   (c) Manner of Payment. If a
Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to the recovery of Damages pursuant to any Claim
that is agreed to pursuant to Section 11.4(a), or a Contested Claim that is
resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Sellers and their
respective successors and assigns, including, but not limited to, any post-
consummation trusts formed to administer claims against the Debtors\' estate,
shall pay the amount of Damages arising out of or resulting from each such
Claim as so determined to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer, or, if applicable, such
amounts shall be released by the escrow agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer.    ARTICLE
