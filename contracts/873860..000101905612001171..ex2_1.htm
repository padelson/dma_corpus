Section 2.4 Post-Closing Asset Deliveries. If any Seller or
Purchaser, in its reasonable discretion, determines after the Closing that any
Books and Records or other materials or assets constituting Purchased Assets
are still in the possession of such Seller or any Affiliate Seller, such
Seller shall, or shall cause such Affiliate Seller to, promptly deliver them
to Purchaser at no additional cost or expense to Purchaser. If any Seller or
Purchaser, in its reasonable discretion, determines after the Closing that
Books and Records or other materials or assets constituting Excluded Assets
were delivered to Purchaser in error, Purchaser shall promptly return them to
the applicable Seller at Sellers' sole cost and expense. In furtherance and
not in limitation of the foregoing (and notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary), each of Sellers and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it is neither Sellers' nor Purchaser's intention to sell, assign
or transfer possession of any documents or communications of Sellers that are
subject to Sellers' attorney-client privilege and/or the work-product
immunity doctrine (the " _Privileged Documents_ "). If it is discovered that
any such Privileged Documents have been inadvertently or unintentionally
turned over to Purchaser, Purchaser agrees, upon Sellers' request, to promptly
turn over to Sellers or destroy such Privileged Documents, in each case at
Sellers' sole cost and expense; _provided_ , that (i) Purchaser shall in no
way be obligated or responsible for reviewing, identifying or making a
determination that any documents or communications in its possession are
Privileged Documents and (ii) Purchaser shall not be obligated to take
any actions under this _Section 2.4_ that may subject it to any liability or
otherwise be in violation with any applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.5 Conveyance of Assets by Affiliate Sellers.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if it is determined by Sellers and Purchaser before, at or after
the Closing that any direct or indirect Subsidiary of ResCap (an " _Affiliate
Seller_ ") owns or possesses any assets or properties that would be deemed to
be Purchased Assets if such Affiliate Seller were a Seller under this
Agreement (such assets and properties, the " _Affiliate Purchased Assets_ "),
then Sellers shall, upon Purchaser's request, promptly cause such
Affiliate Seller to transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Purchaser such
Affiliate Purchased Assets in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay any
additional amounts to Sellers in consideration for the transfer of such
Affiliate Purchased Assets to Purchaser other than those amounts that
Purchaser is obligated to pay to Sellers pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Unless
otherwise consented to by Purchaser, any Affiliate Seller shall be required to
be a debtor in the Bankruptcy Case.

  



  

(b) To the extent that any Affiliate Purchased Assets are transferred,
assigned, conveyed and delivered by an Affiliate Seller to Purchaser pursuant
to this _Section 2.5_ , then each representation and warranty set forth in
_Article IV_ shall be deemed to be applicable to such Affiliate Seller as if
such Affiliate Seller were a Seller and to such Affiliate Purchased Assets as
if such Affiliate Purchased Assets were Purchased Assets.

  



  

(c) _Article IX_ and the Servicing Transfer Agreement shall also
govern the transfer of any Mortgage Servicing owned by Affiliate Sellers, as

Section 2.6 Non-Assignable Purchased Assets; Necessary Consents.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer and
shall not effect the assignment or transfer of any Purchased Asset if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the approval, authorization or consent
of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit by, any third party
thereto (each such action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "), would constitute a
breach thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser
thereunder, unless the Bankruptcy Court has entered a Final Order (which may
include the Sale Approval Order) whose effectiveness has not been stayed
providing that (i) such Necessary Consent is not required or (ii) the
Purchased Assets shall be assigned or transferred regardless of any such
Necessary Consent and there shall be no breach or adverse effect on the rights
of Purchaser thereunder for the failure to obtain any such Necessary Consent.
As Purchaser may reasonably request, if the Bankruptcy Court has not
entered such an Order, Sellers and Purchaser will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents with respect to any such
Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for
the assignment thereof to Purchaser. If any such Necessary Consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would
adversely affect the rights of any Seller thereunder so that Purchaser would
not in fact receive all such rights, such Seller and Purchaser will cooperate
in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Purchaser would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including, to the extent that such an arrangement would be
permitted by Law and the related Contract, subcontracting, sub-licensing, or
sub-leasing to Purchaser, or under which such Seller would enforce for the
benefit of Purchaser, with Purchaser assuming such Seller's obligations in
accordance with this Agreement, any and all rights of such Seller against a
third party thereto.

  



  

Section 2.7 Assumption of Certain Liabilities. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein and as additional consideration for

further obligations with respect thereto. Other than the Assumed Liabilities,
Purchaser shall not assume any Liability of any nature or kind whatsoever of
Sellers.

  



  

Section 2.8 Retained Liabilities. Sellers shall retain and be
responsible for all Retained Liabilities and Purchaser shall not have any
obligation of any nature or kind with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 2.9 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall take place at the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 1290
Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10104 on the second Business Day
following the date on which the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ , _8.2_
and _8.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature can be satisfied
only at the Closing but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) have been satisfied or waived, but no earlier than 18 Business
Days following the Cut-off Date nor, at Purchaser's or Sellers' option, later
than the last Business Day of the month in which such conditions
are satisfied or waived, or at such other time and place as the parties
hereto may mutually agree; provided, that the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect any Closing on the last Business Day of a month.
At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Purchase Price in accordance with
_Sections 2.11_ and _3.1_ , the transfer of title to the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Contracts and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities shall take
place, and the appropriate parties shall take all actions required under
_Sections 2.10_ , _2.11_ and _2.12_ and all other actions not previously
taken but required to be taken hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date. It
is a condition of the Closing that all matters of payment and the execution
and delivery of documents by any party to the others pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement be concurrent requirements, and that nothing will be complete
at the Closing until everything required as a condition precedent to the
Closing has been paid, executed and delivered, as the case may be.

cooperation, including full access to books, records and employees in

days of delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement (or within 15
days of the final determination of the Purchase Price in accordance with
_Section 3.2(d)_ ), (i) if the Purchase Price is less than the Cut-off Date
Purchase Price, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such

binding in its entirety at the end of such 60-day period. The Dispute Notice
shall set forth, in reasonable detail on a line-item by line-item basis, the
basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and Sellers' determination of
the Purchase Price. If Sellers deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within
such period and the parties are unable to agree as to all issues in the
Dispute Notice within the ten Business Day period immediately following the
day after the Dispute Notice is received by Purchaser, then the Dispute
Notice may be submitted by either Sellers or Purchaser to an Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve the disputed items set forth therein in accordance
with _Section 3.2(d)_.

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. An Independent Accounting Firm shall conduct a
review of the Dispute Notice and any supporting documentation submitted by
either Purchaser or Sellers. The parties shall direct the Independent
Accounting Firm to, as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 60
days following its receipt of the Dispute Notice, deliver to Sellers and
Purchaser a report (the " _Adjustment Report_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail the Independent Accounting Firm's determination with respect to
the issues specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be
made to the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement together with supporting
calculations. The Independent Accounting Firm has no authority to review or
raise items not expressly identified in the Dispute Notice. With respect to
each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either Sellers or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by either
Sellers or Purchaser in the Dispute Notice or the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, respectively, with respect to such disputed line item. Such
Adjustment Report and the revisions, if any, to be made to the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement shall be final and binding on the parties, absent
arithmetical error, and shall be deemed a final arbitration award that is
enforceable against each of the parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction, and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to such
Adjustment Report and paid in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne 50% by Sellers and
50% by Purchaser.

  



  

Section 3.3 Allocation of the Purchase Price for Tax Purposes.

  



  

(a) The Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Tax
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in a manner consistent with an
allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), which Allocation
Schedule shall be prepared by Purchaser and provided to Sellers for their
review and the parties' mutual agreement within 120 days after the Closing
Date. The parties shall cooperate reasonably in attempting to reach such a
mutual agreement. If the Allocation Schedule is not mutually agreed upon
within such period, the parties shall submit such dispute to an
Independent Accounting Firm for a decision that shall be rendered in a timely
manner in order to permit the timely filing of all applicable Tax forms. The
Independent Accounting Firm's review shall be final and binding on the parties
except as otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Tax Code or similar provision of other Tax law (a "
_Determination_ "). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser. The parties agree to
adjust the Allocation Schedule as appropriate to reflect amounts released to
Sellers from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

  



  

(b) Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall (i) be bound by such allocation
for purposes of determining Taxes ( _but not for any other purpose_ ), (ii)
prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax
Returns on a basis consistent with such allocation, and (iii) take no
position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with such
allocation on any applicable Tax Return, except in each case as otherwise
required by a Determination. If the allocation set forth on the Allocation
Schedule is disputed by any Government Entity with taxing authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party hereto
concerning the existence of, material developments regarding, and resolution
of such dispute.

Escrow Agreement to Sellers and the Escrow Agent and delivered to the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement,
$72,000,000 in immediately available funds (the " _Cash Deposit_ "). Any Cash
Deposit shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an interest-bearing account
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Cash Deposit shall not be the property of any Seller during such time that
the Cash Deposit is held by the Escrow Agent. The Cash Deposit shall be held
by the Escrow Agent to serve as an earnest money deposit under this
Agreement to be released as follows:

  



  

(a) _Effect of Closing_. If the Closing occurs, Sellers and Purchaser
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to, on the Closing Date, apply the
Cash Deposit, together with all accrued investment income thereon, toward the
payment of the Cut-off Date Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Cash Deposit in
accordance with the terms of the Deposit Escrow Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

  



  

Except as disclosed to Purchaser by Sellers in the Disclosure Memorandum,
Sellers jointly and severally represent and warrant to Purchaser, as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent
any such representations and warranties shall have been expressly made as of
a particular date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be
made only as of such date), as follows:

  



  

Section 4.1 Organization and Authority. Each Seller is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has all
requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority to own,
lease, hold and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as conducted as of the date of this Agreement. Each Seller has the
corporate or other organizational power, authority and right to enter into
and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to complete
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (subject to entry of the
Sale Procedures Order and the Sale Approval Order). The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and (subject to
entry of the Sale Procedures Order and the Sale Approval Order) validly
authorized by all appropriate corporate or other organizational authority,
and no other corporate or other organizational action on the part of any
Seller is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
such Seller of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligations of each
Seller, enforceable against each Seller in accordance with its terms, except
(i) as such enforceability may be limited by principles of public policy and
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditor's rights or by general equity principles (the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ "); (ii) that enforceability of the provisions
hereof requiring consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby is
subject to entry of the Sale Approval Order or any other Order by the
Bankruptcy Court; and (iii) that enforceability of all other provisions hereof
is subject to entry of the Sale Procedures Order and any other action by the
Bankruptcy Court. Each Ancillary Agreement, when required by this Agreement
to be delivered to Purchaser, will be duly and validly executed and delivered
by each Seller that will be a party thereto, and upon such execution and

 PRE-CLOSING MATTERS AND OTHER COVENANTS

  



  

Section 6.1 Subsequent Actions; Further Assurances. Subject to the
Bankruptcy Exceptions, Sellers and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause

practicable, including, (i) opposing any objections to, appeals from or
petitions to reconsider or reopen any such approval by Persons not a party to
this Agreement and (ii) obtaining any Final Orders approving the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, if required.
Purchaser shall not amend or modify the Commitment Letters in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and delivered to Sellers, except with the
consent of Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If at any
time after the Closing, Purchaser shall consider or be advised that any
assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable (a) to
vest, perfect or confirm ownership (of record or otherwise) in Purchaser, as
applicable, its title or interest in the Purchased Assets or (b) otherwise to
carry out this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver all bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, UCC filings, powers of attorney, assignments,
assurances and orders and take and do all such other actions and things as may

any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such

Section 6.2 Third Party Consents. Sellers and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as reasonably practicable,

to Purchaser of the Business or the Purchased Assets or have a materially
adverse effect on the business of Purchaser or its Affiliates. Each party
hereto shall promptly provide the other parties with copies of any
communication, including any written objection, litigation or administrative
proceeding that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby received
by such party from any Government Entity or any other Person regarding
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, if and to the
extent a rating agency "no-downgrade" letter is expressly required under any
Servicing Agreement (if and to the extent required under Order of the
Bankruptcy Court) and is not obtained by Closing, such Servicing Agreement
and the related Servicing Advance shall not be transferred as part of the
Purchased Assets at Closing and Purchaser shall not be required to pay for
such assets as part of the Purchase Price.

environmental consultants, financing sources and other representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to
the personnel, properties, books, Contracts, Tax Returns and records of
Sellers (to the extent Related to the Business) and during such period shall
furnish to Purchaser any information concerning the Purchased Assets and
Sellers (to the extent relating to the Business) that is reasonably available
to Sellers, as Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided,_ _however_ , that
such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the business of Sellers and that
nothing herein will obligate Sellers to violate any applicable Law.

  



  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Sellers will
deliver to Purchaser (i) such financial and operating information Related to
the Business as is provided (and no later than two Business Days after being

Business, (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than
30 days after the end of each calendar month during the period from the date
of this Agreement to the Closing Date, unaudited monthly financial
statements and operating or management reports of ResCap (with such
statements and reports to be in the same form as made available pursuant to
the DIP Financing Agreements), and (iii) as soon as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
unaudited quarterly financial statements and operating or management reports
of ResCap (with such statements and reports to be in the same form as made
available pursuant to the DIP Financing Agreements).

  



  

(c) Sellers shall provide such cooperation as may be necessary and
reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist Purchaser to obtain financing to
enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, including such
financial information necessary as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser
to assist in preparation of customary offering or information documents to be
used for the completion of such financing, making available, at times
mutually agreed upon, appropriate members of senior management of each Seller
for the purpose of meeting with proposed lenders providing or arranging such
financing, rating agencies, diligence sessions relating to Sellers and road
shows and otherwise cooperating with diligence efforts of the applicable
lenders to the extent customary and reasonable.

preserve and retain, all agreements, documents, books, records and files
(including any documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental
actions, suits, proceedings or investigations) relating to the Business prior
to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that if at the end of the seven years, any
third-party charge, complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, claim or demand identified in _Section 6.4(c)_ is ongoing,
the parties shall maintain and preserve all such information relating thereto
until one year after such action, suit, proceeding or investigation has been
finally concluded.

information that such other party reasonably deems necessary, including in
connection with the Bankruptcy Case or any report or Tax Return required to be
filed under applicable Law (but so as not to unduly disrupt the normal course
of operations of Purchaser), including preparing or defending any Tax Return
and any interim or annual report or other accounting statements.

  



  

(c) If and for so long as any party hereto is contesting or defending
against any third-party charge, complaint, action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, claim or demand, including in the Bankruptcy Case, in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction

including employee compensation and benefits costs) of the contesting or
defending party. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.4(c)_  shall not
apply with respect to disputes between the parties hereto.

  



  

(d) Purchaser agrees, at Sellers' cost and expense, to make available, at
the reasonable request of Sellers, any books and records that may be included
in the Purchased Assets to the extent they may relate to Excluded Assets and,
if necessary, to provide such original books and records to any purchaser of
such Excluded Assets and to retain only a copy thereof, subject to
the delivery by such purchaser of a non-disclosure agreement as reasonably
requested by Purchaser.

Servicing Agreement), following commercially reasonable efforts to provide

any Contract Related to the Business that, if any Seller had entered into such
Contract immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, would be a Material
Contract or a Servicing Agreement; _provided_ that (w) Sellers may enter into

Section 6.7 Employee Matters.

  



  

(a) (i) With respect to each Business Employee, not later than
December 15, 2012, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with an updated version
of the Business Employee List referenced in _Section 4.13(a)_ , reflecting

Employee List from time to time prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
representatives of Sellers, Purchaser and the Walter Entity shall meet to
discuss the employee needs of Sellers to complete the Post-Closing Pipeline
and the Walter Entity to operate the Consumer Lending Platform post-Closing.
Good faith consideration shall be given to an equitable distribution
of management, operations, information systems and other personnel necessary
to effectively operate the respective functions. Not later than January 15,
2013, Sellers, Purchaser and the Walter Entity shall finalize the respective
lists with those Business Employees to be retained by Sellers being referred
to as the "Retained Originations Employees" and "Retained ETS Employees" and
those Business Employees to be transferred to (x) the Walter Entity being
referred to as the "Transferred Originations Employees" and (y) Purchaser
being referred to as the "Transferred ETS Employees". Sellers, Purchaser and
the Walter Entity shall also agree upon a list of any Retained
Originations Employees and Retained ETS Employees who will be transferred to
the Walter Entity or Purchaser post-Closing, along with an estimated schedule
for such transfer. Any such employees shall be deemed Transferred Originations
Employees or Transferred ETS Employees as of the date of transfer to the
Walter Entity or Purchaser, as applicable. Subject to the proviso in
the first sentence of _Section 6.7(b)_ , neither Purchaser nor the Walter
Entity shall have any responsibility for Retained Originations Employees or
Retained ETS Employees who are not transferred to the Walter Entity or
Purchaser.

  



  

(b) Not later than January 15, 2013, Purchaser and the Walter
Entity shall provide a list to Sellers of those Business Employees who will
be offered employment by Purchaser or the Walter Entity effective as of the
Closing Date (together with those employees on the list of Transferred
Originations Employees and Transferred ETS Employees, the " _Transferred
Employee List_ "); _provided_  that the severance obligation that would have
been owed to personnel on the Transferred Employee List by the Sellers shall
equal or exceed the Severance Threshold. No Seller shall preclude Purchaser
or the Walter Entity from offering employment to any Business Employee or
solicit any such Business Employee to refuse such offer of employment. It is
understood and agreed that if the Transferred Employee List includes Business
Employees to whom the Walter Entity will make offers of employment, the terms
of this _Section 6.7_ that apply to Purchaser shall also apply to the Walter
Entity.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to each Business
Employee on the Transferred Employee List an offer (the " _Employment Offer_
") of employment on the terms set forth in this _Section 6.7_ , effective as
of the later of the Closing Date or the date such Business Employee accepts
such Employment Offer; _provided_ that each Employment Offer shall be a
Qualified Employment Offer (" _Qualified Employment Offer_ "). A Qualified
Employment Offer to a Business Employee shall _not_  result in any of the
following: (1) a substantial change in current duties for which the employee
no longer qualifies; (2) a substantial change in current duties which results
in a twenty percent (20%) or more reduction in salary; (3) a geographic
transfer such that the distance over the shortest, most commonly traveled
route from the Business Employee's home to the new work location would be at
least 50 miles greater than the distance from the Business Employee's home to
his or her current work location;; (4) base salary and target incentive
opportunity that is less than 80% of such Business Employee's current salary
and incentive package. Each Business Employee who accepts Purchaser's offer
of employment and who becomes an employee of Purchaser shall be a "
_Transferred Employee_." Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in effecting
the Transferred Employees' transfer of employment from Sellers to Purchaser
as contemplated hereby.

--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(d) For at least one year following the Closing, to the extent that
a Transferred Employee remains employed by Purchaser, subject to the terms of
the applicable Employment Offer, Purchaser shall employ such Transferred
Employee on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate than
those provided by Purchaser to similarly situated employees of Purchaser,
including with respect to salary or wages, paid time off, bonus opportunity
and employee benefits (it being understood and agreed that this sentence shall
not require Purchaser to continue to employ any Transferred Employee).
Sellers shall retain all responsibility for providing severance
compensation and benefits to each Business Employee (including each Business
Employee who is a Transferred Employee) to the extent such Business Employee
is or becomes entitled to such severance compensation and benefits pursuant to
any severance plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained by a Seller
or any Affiliate thereof. To the extent that a Transferred Employee is
terminated by the Purchaser without cause within the first year of employment
by Purchaser and such termination qualifies for severance benefits, such
severance benefits shall be equal to the severance benefits that such
Transferred Employee would have been eligible for pursuant to Seller's
severance plan at the time of the Closing. Sellers shall retain all
responsibility for paying retention bonuses or similar compensation to the
extent not expressly assumed by Purchaser pursuant to this paragraph.

  



  

(e) Unless prohibited by Law or otherwise provided in an Employment
Offer, all unused vacation and paid time off of the Transferred
Employees accrued as of the Closing Date shall, effective as of the Closing
Date or, if later, the date on which such Transferred Employee becomes an
employee of Purchaser, be transferred to and assumed by Purchaser, and
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall recognize and provide all such
unused paid time off to the extent such paid time off is reflected in the
Closing Date Schedule of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities. Sellers
shall be responsible for paying out any earned and unused paid time off of (i)
the Business Employees who are not Transferred Employees, and (ii)
Transferred Employees to the extent such paid time off cannot be assumed by
Purchaser in accordance with applicable Law (unless a Transferred Employee
consents to such assumption by Purchaser, if allowed under applicable Law) or
are not reflected in the Closing Date Schedule of Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities.

  



  

(f) Unless prohibited by Law, with respect to each Transferred Employee,
Purchaser agrees to assume and honor all accrued but unpaid
bonus compensation to the extent (i) such bonus compensation is reflected in
the Closing Date Schedule of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities and
(ii) all terms and conditions applicable to such bonus compensation
(including, the name of the recipient, the amount, as updated through the
Closing Date, and the time and form of payment) are set forth on _Section
4.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Memorandum. Sellers shall be responsible for
paying all accrued but unpaid bonus compensation to the extent not assumed by
Purchaser pursuant to this paragraph (including any amounts owed to
Transferred Employees that are greater than the amount reflected on
the Closing Date Schedule of Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities due to
fluctuations in the value of equity on which such amounts are based or
otherwise).

  



  

   

65

(g) Purchaser shall also recognize each Transferred Employee's
service at such Seller for all purposes (other than benefit accruals
under defined benefit plans or retiree medical arrangements) under any Plans
maintained by Purchaser for the benefit of the Transferred Employees to the
extent such service was recognized under the same or comparable Plans that
covered the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(h) From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall retain all (i)
employment obligations with regard to those employees and former employees of
Sellers (or who are otherwise Related to the Business) who are not Transferred
Employees, and (ii) all liabilities related to any Transferred Employees to
the extent such liability is not expressly assumed by Purchaser in this
_Section 6.7_.

  



  

(i) The Sellers shall cause, effective as of the Closing Date,
each Transferred Employee to become fully vested in his or her account balance
under the Ally Financial Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Seller 401(k)
Plan_ "). To the extent not already provided for under the Seller 401(k)
Plan, the Sellers shall amend, or cause to be amended, the Seller 401(k) Plan
to provide for, with respect to any Transferred Employee who elects a "direct
rollover" of his or her full account balance, the distribution and rollover
of any promissory note evidencing a loan outstanding under the Seller 401(k)
Plan.

  



  

(j) Without limiting the generality of _Section 12.8_ , nothing in
this _Section 6.7_ shall (a) be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to
amend, any employee benefit plan, (b) obligate Purchaser, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular
employee or (c) confer any rights or benefits on any person, including any
Transferred Employee, other than the parties to this Agreement. Purchaser
shall be entitled to rely on information provided by Sellers with respect
to any Business Employee Liabilities and the performance of its obligations
under this _Section 6.7_.

  



  

(k) If and to the extent Sellers are not "liquidating fiduciaries
in bankruptcy" within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (" _WARN_ "), Sellers shall assume any liabilities,
obligations and commitments in respect of WARN and any similar state and
local laws, if any, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in respect of Business Employees who are not Transferred Employees.

Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates (or equity
interests held by Purchaser or any of its controlled Affiliates in entities
with assets or businesses); and (iv) take promptly, in the event that any
permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes

judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit

(d) Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall, after the entry of the Sale
Approval Order, agree to accept any agreement that would have the effect of
delaying the consummation of any action contemplated by this Agreement without

shall commit to or agree with any Antitrust Authority to stay, toll or extend
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Laws,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.

  



  

(e) Neither Purchaser nor any of its controlled Subsidiaries shall take

Section 6.19 Confidentiality.

  



  

(a) After the Closing, Sellers will, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and instruct their respective Affiliates to, hold in
confidence and not use in any manner detrimental to the Business all
Confidential Information concerning the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Assumed Contracts, except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (i) in the public domain prior to the
Closing or (ii) in the public domain at or after the Closing through no fault
of Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives. If, after the Closing, Sellers or any of their Affiliates or

Confidential Information, Sellers shall to the extent permitted by Law (A)
promptly notify Purchaser to permit Purchaser, at its expense, to seek a
protective order or take other appropriate action and (B) cooperate as
reasonably requested by Purchaser in Purchaser's efforts to obtain a
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such Confidential Information, but only at Purchaser's sole
cost and expense. If, after the Closing and in the absence of a protective
order, Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives are compelled as a matter of Law to disclose any such
Confidential Information to a third party, such Person may disclose to the

with respect to servicing advances under clauses (i) and (v) of the definition

any investor consent for such amendment for servicing fees. Purchaser agrees

third party fee, cost or expense in excess of $25,000 in connection with the
performance of Sellers' obligations under this Section 6.24, Sellers shall
obtain Purchaser's consent for such fee, cost or expense, which consent shall

ARTICLE XI 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 11.1 Indemnification by Sellers.

  



  

(a) Each Seller agrees, on a joint and several basis, to indemnify and
hold harmless each of Purchaser, Ocwen Financial Corporation (" _Parent_
"), Parent's direct and indirect Subsidiaries, Parent's controlling
shareholders and its and their respective directors, officers and employees
(each a " _Purchaser Group Member_ ") from and against any and all Losses
incurred by such Purchaser Group Member in connection with or arising from
any breach of any Core Representations or the inaccuracy of any
Core Representations of Sellers contained or referred to in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Sellers pursuant hereto;
_provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid
by Sellers pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)_ exceed the Indemnity Escrow
Amount.

  



  

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)_ shall
terminate on the earlier of one year after the Closing Date and the entry of a
Final Order closing the Bankruptcy Case (the " _Termination Date_ ") (and no
claims shall be made by any Purchaser Group Member under _Section 11.1(a)_
after the Termination Date), except that the indemnification by Sellers shall
continue as to any Loss of which any Purchaser Group Member has notified
ResCap in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.2_ on or prior to
the Termination Date, as to which the obligation of Sellers shall continue
until the liability of Sellers shall have been determined pursuant to this
_Article XI_ , and Sellers shall have reimbursed all Purchaser Group Members
for the full amount of such Losses in accordance with this _Article XI_.

  



  

Section 11.2 Notice of Claims.

  



  

(a) Any Purchaser Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder shall
give to each Seller obligated to provide indemnification to such
Purchaser Group Member (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection
herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in
respect of any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity by or
against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought (each such
action or suit being a " _Third Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly after
the action or suit is commenced; _provided_ _further_ that failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent it shall have been actually prejudiced by such failure
and then only to the extent of such prejudice.

  



  

   

86 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which a Purchaser Group Member shall be entitled under
this _Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between
the Purchaser Group Member and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or
decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means
to which the Purchaser Group Member and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Purchaser Group Member
shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Loss suffered
by it.

  



  

Section 11.3 Third Person Claims.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 11.3(b)_ , the Purchaser Group Member shall
have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Person Claim against such
Purchaser Group Member as to which indemnification will be sought by any
Purchaser Group Member from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the
Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Purchaser Group Member in connection therewith; _provided_ , that:

  



  

(i) the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at
its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Person Claim as to
which the Purchaser Group Member has so elected to conduct and control the
defense thereof; and

  



  

(ii) the Purchaser Group Member shall not, without the written consent of
the Indemnitor, pay, compromise or settle any such Third Person Claim,
except that no such consent shall be required if, following a written request
from the Purchaser Group Member, the Indemnitor shall fail, within 28 days
after the making of such request or such shorter period if such Purchaser
Group Member is required to respond prior to the end of such 28-day period,
to acknowledge and agree in writing that, if such Third Person Claim shall be
adversely determined, such Indemnitor has an obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder to such Purchaser Group Member.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Group Member shall have the
right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Person Claim without such
consent,  _provided,_ that in such event the Purchaser Group Member shall
waive any right to indemnity therefor hereunder unless such consent is
unreasonably withheld.

  



  

   

87 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(b) If any Third Person Claim against any Purchaser Group Member is
solely for money damages or will have no continuing effect in any material
respect on the Business or the Purchased Assets, then the Indemnitor shall
have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense, compromise or settlement of any such Third Person Claim against
such Purchaser Group Member as to which indemnification will be sought by any
Purchaser Group Member from any Indemnitor hereunder if the Indemnitor has
acknowledged and agreed in writing that, if the same is adversely determined,
the Indemnitor has an obligation to provide indemnification to the Purchaser
Group Member in respect thereof, and in any such case the Purchaser Group
Member shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitor
in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Purchaser Group Member may
participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the
defense of any such Third Person Claim as to which the Indemnitor has so
elected to conduct and control the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
any Third Person Claim if the reasonably expected monetary damages for which
the Purchaser Group Member would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement is greater than the Indemnity Escrow Funds. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser Group Member shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any such Third Person Claim, _provided,_ that in such event the
Purchaser Group Member shall waive any right to indemnity therefor hereunder .

  



  

Section 11.4 Claims Against the Indemnity Escrowed Funds. Purchaser shall
have the right to notify the Indemnity Escrow Agent of any claim
for indemnification made by any Purchaser Group Member pursuant to this
_Article XI_. Promptly following the final determination in accordance with
this _Article XI_ of any claim for indemnification made by any Purchaser Group
Member, upon request by Purchaser, Sellers shall execute and deliver a
certificate requesting the Indemnity Escrow Agent to deliver by wire transfer
to an account designated by Purchaser immediately available funds in the
amount of such claim as finally determined in accordance with this _Article
XI_ (not to exceed the Indemnity Escrowed Funds). On the Termination Date, the
Indemnity Escrow Agent shall deliver to Sellers all the Indemnity Escrowed
Funds then held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent by wire transfer to one or
more accounts designated by ResCap; _provided_ , _however_ , that if prior to
the Termination Date Purchaser notifies the Indemnity Escrow Agent in writing
that all or a portion of the Indemnity Escrowed Funds is subject to claims for
indemnification under this Agreement that have not been finally determined
(the " _Outstanding Claims_ "), the amount delivered to Sellers upon the
Termination Date shall be equal to the Indemnity Escrowed Funds then held by
the Indemnity Escrow Agent, less the sum of any amounts subject to the
Outstanding Claims. If at any time after the Termination Date the amount of
the Indemnity Escrowed Funds then held by the Indemnity Escrow Agent exceeds
the sum of any amounts subject to the Outstanding Claims, ResCap and
Purchaser shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Indemnity
Escrow Agent to deliver such excess amount to Sellers by wire transfer to one
or more accounts designated by ResCap.

  



  

Section 11.5 Adjustment to Purchase Price. To the extent that any payment
by Sellers under this _Article XI_ can be properly so characterized under
applicable Tax law, such payment shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

Section 11.6 Survival. Sellers and Purchaser agree that all of the
representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers and Purchaser contained
in this Agreement, or any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
shall terminate at the Closing Date, except that the Core Representations
shall survive as provided in _Section 11.1(b)_ and the covenants that by their
terms survive the Closing Date shall survive the Closing Date.

Section 11.7 Exclusive Remedy

  



  

. Except in the case of fraud or where a Party seeks to obtain specific
performance pursuant to _Section 12.11_ , from and after the Closing, the sole
and exclusive remedy of any Purchaser Group Member in connection with any
breach of any Core Representations or the inaccuracy of any Core
Representations of Sellers contained or referred to in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Sellers pursuant hereto, whether
under this Agreement or arising under common law or any other Law, shall be as
provided in this _Article XI_. Nothing in this _Section 11.7_ shall operate
to interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of _Section 3.2_
or any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE XII 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
the Sale Procedures Order, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transaction hereunder, shall be

hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
