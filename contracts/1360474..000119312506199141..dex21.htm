Company, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company and Merger Sub are
sometimes herein referred to as the " _Constituent Entities_."

vested with all property, whether real, personal or mixed, and all debts due
on whatever account, and all other causes of action, and all other interests
belonging to or due to each of the Constituent Entities, and (c) be
responsible and liable for all the obligations and liabilities of each of the
Constituent Entities, all with the effect set forth in the California Code.

2.3 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 300 S. Grand
Avenue, Suite 2200, Los Angeles, California 90071, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to
be specified by the parties which shall be no later than two (2)
Business Days after satisfaction (or waiver as provided herein) of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by
their nature will be satisfied at the Closing), unless another time, date
and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date upon which the
Closing occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Simultaneously
with, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing, the parties shall
cause a certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of California as provided in Section 1103 of the California Code. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the certificate of merger is so
filed or at such later time as is set forth in the certificate of merger, if
different, which time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

2.4 _Charter, Bylaws, Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, (a) the
Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and thereafter may be amended in accordance with its terms and
as provided by law; (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
and thereafter may be amended in accordance with their terms and as provided
by law; and (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the persons listed on _Schedule 2.4_ hereto, in each case until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal. 



 

-9- 2.5 _Common Stock and Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of any party:

(a) Each share of Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
without any action on the part of the holders thereof into and represent the
right to receive and become exchangeable for an amount in cash (without
interest and payable in accordance with this Article II) equal to the Per
Share Amount;

(b) Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted, without
any action on the part of the holders thereof, into and represent the right to
receive and become exchangeable for an amount in cash (without interest and
payable in accordance with this Article II) equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such share of Preferred Stock
(including the conversion of accrued and unpaid dividends thereon) immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Per Share Amount;

(c) Each Share, if any, held in the Companys treasury or owned beneficially
by Buyer or Merger Sub shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor; and

(d) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

2.6 _Options and Warrants_. With respect to any Option or Warrant outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time:

(a) _Options_.

(i) Each Option, to the extent outstanding and exercisable for one or more
shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time or which will
otherwise in accordance with its terms vest on an accelerated basis on the
consummation of the Merger, shall, at the Effective Time, be cancelled and
cease as to those shares of Common Stock. In exchange for each such cancelled
Option, the Company (or the Surviving Corporation as its successor) shall pay
to the holder a cash amount (the " _Option Amount_ ") determined by
multiplying (A) the number of shares of Common Stock as to which such Option
is so cancelled by (B) the dollar amount (if any) by which the Per Share
Amount exceeds the exercise price per share of Common Stock in effect under
such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. However, no cash amount
or other consideration shall be payable with respect to any cancelled Option
for which the exercise price payable per share of Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time is equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount.
The cash payments made to each holder of a cancelled Option shall be subject
to the collection of all applicable federal, state and local income and
employment withholding taxes by the Company (or the Surviving Corporation),
and all cash payments made to each such holder of a cancelled Option shall
accordingly be reduced by the amount of those withholding taxes, with the net
amount to be paid to such holder in accordance with Sections 2.18(a) and (b).



 

-10- (ii) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that each Option, to the
extent outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time but not
accelerated or otherwise exercisable for one or more of the underlying shares
of Common Stock, shall be cancelled without further action at the Effective
Time.

(iii) _Schedule 2.6(a)_ sets forth a true and complete list as of the date
hereof of each outstanding Option, including the option holder, the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such option, the number of those shares for
which the Option is exercisable or will be accelerated and exercisable as of
the Closing Date, the number of shares for which the Option is not exercisable
and the exercise price payable per share. On the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer an updated _Schedule 2.6(a)_ current as of such
Closing Date

(b) _Warrants_. Each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be sold by the holder thereof to the Company in consideration for
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, payable in
accordance with this Article II (the " _Warrant Amount_ "), equal to the
product of (i) the Per Share Amount less the exercise price per share of
Common Stock under such Warrant as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.7 _Merger Price and Closing Estimate_.

(a) _Merger Price_. Subject to Section 2.8, the merger price (the " _Merger
Price_ ") shall be equal to:

(i) Two Hundred Ninety-One Million Dollars ($291,000,000); 

(ii) plus the aggregate amount of Cash Equivalents;

(iii) plus the principal amount and accrued interest due to the Company under
that certain Note and Pledge Agreement dated June 30, 2005, issued by
Educational Services of America, College Park School and Rossier Educational
Enterprises, Inc.;

(iv) minus the aggregate of all Indebtedness; and

(v) minus the aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses.

(b) _Closing Estimate_. For purposes of the Closing, the Company shall, not
less than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, make a good-faith estimate
of the Merger Price, as adjusted by the Working Capital Adjustment Amount
(the " _Closing Estimate_ "), based upon the most recent ascertainable
financial information of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

(c) _Fully Diluted Shares_. For purposes of the Closing and the calculation of
the Per Share Amount and the Closing Date Per Share Amount, the Company shall,
not less than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, provide Buyer with an
officers certificate (the  



 

-11-  " _Allocation Certificate_ ") setting forth (i) the total number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
determined on a Fully Diluted Basis and (ii) the holders thereof. The
Allocation Certificate shall be final and binding on the Company, all
Shareholders and holders of Options and Warrants.

2.8 _Working Capital Adjustment_. The Merger Price will be (i) increased on a
dollar for dollar basis by the amount by which the Working Capital as of the
open of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_ ") is
greater than Target Working Capital, or (ii) decreased on a dollar for dollar
basis by the amount by which the Working Capital as of the open of business
on the Closing Date is less than Target Working Capital. Working Capital will
not include any Transaction Expenses to the extent included in the calculation
of the Merger Price (without regard to this Section 2.8).

2.9 _Determination of Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and Working Capital_. The
amounts of Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and Closing Working Capital shall
each be determined from a consolidated balance sheet (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the open of business on
the Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and _Exhibit D-1_, provided that in the event of any
conflict between GAAP and _Exhibit D-1_, GAAP shall control; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Working Capital shall be calculated solely on
the basis of the line items set forth on _Exhibit D-1_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in GAAP but without duplication, the
Closing Balance Sheet shall reflect as a current asset of the Company (and
Working Capital shall include as an asset) the Tax Amount calculated in the
manner set forth on _Exhibit D-2_. The " _Tax Amount_ " means the economic
cash value of Income Tax benefits to the Company and its Subsidiaries arising
at any time from any and all deductible payments related to (i) any exercise,
or cancellation pursuant to Section 2.6(a), of an Option that occurs on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any bonuses paid
on the Closing Date in connection with the Merger, or (iii) all transaction
expenses that are deductible for Tax purposes, including (to the extent
deductible in the year ending on the Closing Date) unamortized (as of
immediately prior to the Closing) transaction expenses with respect to
Indebtedness being paid off at Closing and the fees and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, investment bankers and the Shareholders Representative.
Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare the Closing Balance Sheet
and deliver the Closing Balance Sheet to the Shareholders Representative not
more than seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date. " _Delivery Date_
" means the date on which the Closing Balance Sheet is so delivered. Buyer
and the Shareholders Representative shall, throughout the entire period
starting on the Closing Date and ending on the Delivery Date, meet from time
to time at either partys request and discuss any and all financial and
business matters relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet.

2.10 _Disputes Regarding Closing Balance Sheet_. Buyer shall make available
to the Shareholders Representative the books, records and personnel of the
Company and the Subsidiaries which the Shareholders Representative requires
in order to review the Closing Balance Sheet and Buyers determination of
Cash Equivalents, Closing Working Capital and Indebtedness. Disputes with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet shall be resolved as follows:

(a) The Shareholders Representative shall have thirty (30) days following the
Delivery Date (the " _Dispute Period_ ") to dispute any of the elements of or
amounts reflected on  



 

-12-  the Closing Balance Sheet and affecting the calculation of the Merger Price
or Per Share Amount (a " _Dispute_ "). If the Shareholders Representative
does not give to Buyer written notice of a Dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ")
within the Dispute Period, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be treated as if it
had been accepted and agreed to by the Shareholders Representative in the
form in which it was delivered, and shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto. If the Shareholders Representative has a Dispute, the
Shareholders Representative shall give Buyer a Dispute Notice within
the Dispute Period, setting forth the elements and amounts with which it
disagrees. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, Buyer
and the Shareholders Representative shall attempt to resolve the Dispute and
agree in writing upon the final content of the disputed Closing Balance
Sheet.

(b) If Buyer and the Shareholders Representative are unable to resolve any
Dispute within the thirty (30) day period following the Shareholders
Representatives delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Shareholders
Representative and Buyer shall jointly engage the Los Angeles office of Ernst
and Young LLP (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ ") as arbitrator. If Ernst and Young
LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as Arbitrating Accountant, the Arbitrating
Accountant shall be the Los Angeles office of an accounting firm selected
promptly by agreement of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative. In
connection with the resolution of any Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant
shall have access to all documents, records, work papers, facilities
and personnel necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. The
Arbitrating Accountants function shall solely be to resolve the Dispute. The
Arbitrating Accountant shall allow Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
(and their respective representatives) to present their respective positions
regarding the Dispute. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at its discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the Dispute, at which conference each party
shall have the right to present additional documents, materials and other
information and to have present its advisors, counsel and accountants. In
connection with such process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral
examinations, testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings.
The Arbitrating Accountant shall thereafter promptly render its decision on
the question in writing and finalize the Closing Balance Sheet. Such written
determination shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto,
and judgment may be entered on the award. Upon the resolution of all
Disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be revised to reflect the
resolution. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be paid
half by the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Shareholders, on
the one hand, and half by Buyer, on the other hand.

2.11 _Manner of Payment of Merger Price and Indebtedness_.

(a) _Paying Agent_.

(i) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall enter into an agreement
with a bank or trust company of recognized standing designated by Buyer and
that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At
the Closing, Buyer shall deposit with the Paying Agent (A) the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, and (B) the Closing Date Merger Amount (collectively, the "
_Payment Fund_ ").



 

-13- (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (" _Certificates_ ") and to
each holder of Warrants (A) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates and Warrants shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates and Warrants to the Paying Agent and which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, and (B) instructions for use in effecting surrender by
such holder of Certificates to the Paying Agent in exchange for a portion of
the Merger Price.

(ii) At or after the Effective Time, the holder of each Certificate and/or
Warrant, upon the surrender by such holder to the Exchange Agent of such
Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, together with the letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed by such holder in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such
Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, a check (or, if requested by such
holder, a wire transfer) for the Per Share Amount into which shares of the
Company Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.5, or Warrant Amount into which such Warrant has been
converted pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and such Certificate or Warrant, as
applicable, shall forthwith thereafter be canceled. Until such time as any
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.13 has been determined, all payments made by
the Paying Agent shall be calculated on the basis that the Per Share Amount
shall be deemed to equal the Closing Date Per Share Amount. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Stock or Warrant, as applicable,
that is not registered on the transfer records of the Company, the
cash consideration payable hereunder with respect to such shares of Company
Stock or Warrant, as applicable, may be paid to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer. Subject to Section 2.19,
each Certificate or Warrant, as applicable, shall be deemed at all times from
and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
exchange as contemplated in this Section 2.11, the Per Share Amount or Warrant
Amount, as applicable, calculated in accordance with this Agreement. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any Per Share Amount payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

2.12 _Further Rights in Company Stock_. Subject to Section 2.13, all
Per Share Amounts issued and paid upon conversion of shares of Company Stock,
all Option Amounts issued and paid and all Warrant Amounts issued and paid,
each in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock,
Option or Warrant, as applicable.

2.13 _Manner of Payment of Adjustment_. Following the Closing, the Buyer and
the Shareholders Representative shall determine the final Merger Price
following the procedures established in Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10. If, based
on the Merger Price as finally determined:

(a) the Merger Price exceeds the Closing Estimate, the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) days of the final
determination of the Merger  



 

-14-  Price) pay the excess (such excess, the " _Additional Merger Consideration_
") to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Shareholders, Option holders and
Warrant holders. The Paying Agent shall promptly pay (i) to each Shareholder
and Warrant holder that has previously delivered to the Paying Agent
Certificates, Warrants, letters of transmittal and other documentation
required by Section 2.11(b)(ii), such Shareholders or Warrant holders pro
rata share of the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Additional Merger
Consideration in accordance with such Shareholders or Warrant holders
Percentage Share, and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation an aggregate amount
equal to the sum of the Option holders pro rata shares of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount and the Additional Merger Consideration in accordance with the
Option holders respective Percentage Shares, to then be distributed by the
Surviving Corporation to each Option holder in accordance with such Option
holders Percentage Share.

(b) the Closing Estimate exceeds the Merger Price, Shareholders
Representative shall direct the Paying Agent to promptly deliver from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount (but in any event within (5) days of the final
determination of the Merger Price) such excess (the " _Working Capital
Adjustment Amount_ ") to the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the Working Capital
Adjustment Amount exceed the Working Capital Escrow Amount and neither the
Company nor any Shareholder shall have any liability whatsoever to the extent
the difference between the Closing Estimate minus the Merger Price, exceeds
the Working Capital Escrow Amount. To the extent the Working Capital Escrow
Amount exceeds the Working Capital Adjustment Amount (such excess, the "
_Released Escrow Amount_ "), the Paying Agent shall promptly pay (i) to each
Shareholder and Warrant holder that has previously delivered to the Paying
Agent Certificates, Warrants, letters of transmittal and other documentation
required by Section 2.11(b)(ii) such Shareholders or Warrant holders pro
rata share of the Released Escrow Amount in accordance with such Shareholders
or Warrant holders Percentage Share, and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation an
aggregate amount equal to the sum of the Option holders pro rata shares of
the Released Escrow Amount in accordance with the Option holders respective
Percentage Shares, to then be distributed by the Surviving Corporation to each
Option holder in accordance with such Option holders Percentage Share.

In each case, such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions furnished by the
Paying Agent (if the payment is to the Paying Agent) or by the Surviving
Corporation (if the payment is to the Surviving Corporation).

2.14 _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Stock for twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time may be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Stock or
Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) for the Merger Price, without
any interest thereon.

2.15 _No Liability_. None of Buyer, the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person for any amount from the Payment Fund
delivered to a governmental authority or agency pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.



 

-15- 2.16 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Buyer and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Shareholder, Option holder
and/or Warrant holder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Option holder and/or Warrant
holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be. 

2.17 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate or Warrant
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or Warrant to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or
Warrant and the payment of any fee charged by the Paying Agent for such
service, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate or Warrant the amount of cash to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article II (subject to any applicable
withholding taxes).

2.18 _Options and Indebtedness_.

(a) At the Closing or promptly thereafter, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the aggregate Option
Amount to be paid to the Option holders calculated on the basis that the Per
Share Amount shall be deemed to equal the Closing Date Per Share Amount.
Buyer shall then cause the Surviving Corporation to issue a payroll check to
each Option holder for such holders Option Amount calculated on the basis
that the Per Share Amount shall be deemed to equal the Closing Date Per Share
Amount, less applicable withholding as set forth in Section 2.6(a).

(b) After the final determination of the Merger Price and upon receipt of the
payment, if any, made to the Surviving Corporation by the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.13(a) or (b), Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to issue a payroll check to each Option holder for such holders
pro rata share of the Working Capital Escrow Amount and Additional Merger
Consideration, or the Released Escrow Amount, as applicable, determined in
accordance with such holders Percentage Share, less applicable withholding
as set forth in Section 2.6(a).

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to also pay
in accordance with the Pay-Off Letters the Indebtedness of the Company set
forth on _Schedule 2.18(c)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

2.19 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any Shareholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger, has demanded and
perfected such  



 

-16-  Shareholders dissenters rights of such Shareholders shares in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the California Code and has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights (a " _Dissenting Share_ "), shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive cash pursuant to
Sections 2.5(a), but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights
as are granted by the applicable provisions of the California Code; provided,
however, that any Dissenting Share held by a Person at the Effective Time who
shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw or lose such dissenters rights, in
either case pursuant to the California Code, shall be deemed to be converted
into, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive cash pursuant to Section
2.5(a).

(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
dissenters rights, withdrawals of demands for dissenters rights and any
other instruments served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
California Code relating to the dissenters rights process received by the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters rights under the
California Code. The Company will not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for dissenters rights and will not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, settle or offer to settle any such demands. 

ARTICLE III

The Company makes the following representations and warranties.
No representation or warranty shall survive the Closing, and none shall merge
into any instrument of conveyance. All representations and warranties of the
Company are made subject to the express exceptions noted in the schedule
delivered by the Company to Buyer concurrently herewith and identified by the

particular schedule of the Disclosure Schedule shall be treated as disclosed
with respect to all other schedules of the Disclosure Schedule regardless of
whether or not a specific reference is made thereto. The inclusion of any item

or representations are made, or have been made, by the Shareholders, the

-28- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY IN ARTICLE III CONSTITUTE THE
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND THE
SHAREHOLDERS TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,
AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND ANY SUBSIDIARY, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS. The Company hereby disclaims
any such other or implied representations and warranties, notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to Buyer, its affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees and representatives of any documentation or other
information, including without limitation, any due diligence materials. The
parties make no representations or warranties to each other, except as
contained in this Agreement, and any and all prior representations and
warranties made by any party or its representatives, whether verbally or in
writing, are merged into this Agreement, it being intended that no such prior
representations or warranties shall survive the execution and delivery

Subsidiary (including the contents of the Confidential Information Memorandum)
regarding their properties, business or assets may not have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP or standards applicable under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and such estimates reflect numerous
assumptions, and are subject to material risks and uncertainties. Buyer
acknowledges that actual results may vary, perhaps materially. Buyer further

financial condition, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations
of the Company and the Subsidiaries in making its determination as to the
propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in entering
into this Agreement, has relied solely on the results of said investigation
and on the representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained
in this Agreement.

ARTICLE V 

Representations and Warranties of Buyer and Merger Sub

Each of Buyer and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company as
follows:

5.1 _Corporate Power; Enforceable Obligation_. Each of Buyer and Merger Sub
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to be
performed by it. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed, and
delivered by Buyer and Merger Sub and is the legal, valid, and binding
obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights in general, and except that the
enforceability of the Agreement is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).



 

-29- 5.2 _No Violations_. The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement by Buyer and Merger Sub will not contravene or violate (a) any law,
rule, or regulation to which Buyer or Merger Sub is subject, (b) any judgment,
order, injunction, or decree of any court, arbitrator, or governmental
authority or agency that is applicable to Buyer or Merger Sub, or (c) the
charter or bylaws of Buyer or Merger Sub; nor will such execution, delivery,
or performance violate, be in conflict with, result in the breach of, or
require the consent of any other party to, any material contract, lease,
license, permit, or other agreement or similar instrument to or by which Buyer
or Merger Sub is a party or otherwise bound or by which any of the assets or
properties of Buyer or Merger Sub may be bound, or give any party with rights
thereunder the right to terminate, cancel, or accelerate the rights or
obligations of Buyer or Merger Sub thereunder.

5.3  _Consents and Approvals_. Except for any filings that may be required to
comply with the HSR Act and any applicable foreign antitrust and competition
laws, no authorization, approval, or consent of, and no registration or filing
with, any governmental authority or agency is required to be made or obtained
by Buyer or Merger Sub in connection with the execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement by Buyer or Merger Sub.

5.4 _Litigation_. There is no pending or threatened, litigation, arbitration,
investigation, or other proceeding involving Buyer or Merger Sub of or before
any court, arbitrator, or governmental, regulatory, or administrative
official, body, or authority that is reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the consummation by Buyer or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

5.5 _Sufficient Funds_. Buyer has, on the date hereof, commitments for all of
the funds required in order to complete this transaction on the terms
contained in this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, attached as
_Schedule 5.5_ hereto are complete and accurate copies of (i) an equity
commitment letter (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") from Bain Capital Fund
VIII, L.P., and (ii) a debt commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
") from the financial institutions identified therein with respect to the
financing of the transactions contemplated hereby (such equity and debt
commitments collectively being the " _Financing_ "). Subject to their terms
and conditions, the Financing, together with all other funds of Buyer, is
sufficient to allow Buyer to pay the full Merger Price and to satisfy in cash
all other obligations of Buyer required to be satisfied at the Closing,
including discharge of all Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses to the extent
required. As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letter (together with the ancillary documents referenced therein or
delivered to the Seller Representative) constitute all of the agreements
entered into between each of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global
Markets and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Bain Capital
Fund VIII, L.P. and/or its affiliates and Buyer and/or its affiliates with
respect to the financing arrangements contemplated thereby. As of the date
hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter are in
full force and effect and have not been modified or amended in any respect. As
of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy, in all material respects, of the
representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement and the
accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the Company to the
Buyer in the course of its due diligence review, Buyer has no reason to
believe that such Financing shall not be available or that the equity and
debt commitments shall not be funded, and Buyer has not made any material
misrepresentation with respect to Buyer in connection with obtaining such  



 

-30-  equity and debt financing commitments. As of the date hereof, assuming the
accuracy, in all material respects, of the representations and warranties of
the Company in this Agreement and the accuracy and completeness of the
information provided by the Company to the Buyer in the course of its due
diligence review, Buyer has no reason to believe that there are any conditions
to the payment of such cash or the drawing of such credit facilities which
cannot be satisfied by Buyer as of the Closing Date.

5.6 _No Brokers_. Except for any broker or finder whose fees and expenses are
the sole responsibility of Buyer, no broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
no broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or finders fee or other
commission from the Company in respect thereof based in any way on agreements,
arrangements, or understandings made by or on behalf of Buyer, Merger Sub or
any of their respective affiliates.

5.7 _Investor Representations_. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its own
account for investment and has no present intent to resell or distribute all
or any portion of the Shares. Buyer understands that the Shares are being sold
without registration under the Securities Act and may not be resold unless
registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from registration
thereunder is available. Buyer also understands that the Shares are being sold
without registration or qualification under any applicable state securities
laws and may not be resold under registered or qualified thereunder.

5.8 _WARN Act_. Neither Buyer nor Merger Sub has any present plans or
intention to carry out, following the Closing, any plant closing or mass
layoff which would violate the WARN Act at any facility of the Companys
business (assuming for purposes of this subsection that no notice would be
given in connection with any such closing or layoff).

use its best efforts to obtain early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act. In addition, each party agrees to promptly make any other filing
that may be required under any antitrust law or by any antitrust authority and
effect all other filings with and notifications to the government agencies in
any other jurisdiction where such filings and notifications are required.
Buyer agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate as soon
as possible each and every impediment under any antitrust law that may be
asserted by any United States or foreign governmental antitrust authority so
as to enable the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated
hereby, including without limitation, committing to and/or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of
such assets or shares as are required to be divested in order to facilitate
the expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period or otherwise

ARTICLE VII

Other Agreements

unless acting with the prior written consent of the Shareholders
Representative, and with the exception of patient and student data (which
Buyer may destroy at any time following the minimum period required
by statute), Buyer shall not (and shall not permit the Company to) destroy or
otherwise dispose of the Companys books, records, files, designs,
specifications, customer lists, supplier lists, information, reports,
correspondence, literature and other sales material, computer software,
magnetic media, and other data and similar materials (all such materials, the
" _Books and Records_ ") without first offering to surrender the Books and
Records which are intended to be  



 

-33-  destroyed or disposed of to the Shareholders Representative. After the
Closing, Buyer (a) shall allow the counsel, accountants, and
other representatives of the Shareholders and their affiliates access to such
Books and Records (with the related right of examination and duplication) upon
reasonable request and during normal business hours and (b) shall make
available the employees of the Company to the extent such availability is
reasonably required by the Shareholders Representative in connection with the
investigation, preparation, conduct, or settlement of or for any dispute,
claim, suit, litigation, or other proceeding by or against the Shareholders
(or any of their affiliates) or any other matter arising out of the business
of the Company prior to the Closing.

7.2 _Investigation and Evaluation_. Buyer acknowledges that (a) Buyer and its
directors, officers, attorneys, accountants, and advisors have been given the
opportunity to examine to the full extent deemed necessary and desirable by
Buyer all books, records, and other information with respect to the Company
and its business, assets, and liabilities, (b) Buyer has taken full
responsibility for determining the scope of its investigations of the Company
and its business, assets, and liabilities, and for the manner in which such
investigations have been conducted, and has examined the Company and its
business, assets, and liabilities to Buyers full satisfaction, (c) Buyer is
fully capable of evaluating the adequacy and accuracy of the information and
material obtained by Buyer in the course of such investigations, and (d) Buyer
has not relied on the Shareholders or the Company with respect to any matter
in connection with Buyers evaluation of the Company and its business,
assets, and liabilities and the transactions contemplated hereby, other than
the representations and warranties of the Company specifically set forth in
Article III. Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its employees, accountants, and
other representatives shall only be entitled to access or have the right to
inspect the Companys business, properties, assets, and records with the prior
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

7.3 _Publicity_. Neither Buyer (or any of its affiliates) nor the Company (or
any of its affiliates) shall issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statement (except for releases and public statements required or
advisable under applicable laws or regulations) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby without first consulting with and obtaining
the approval of Buyer, in the case of the Company, or without first consulting
with and obtaining the approval of the Company, in the case of Buyer.

7.4 _Employee and Related Matters_.

(a) The employees of the Company or any Subsidiary on the Closing Date shall
be collectively referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_."

(b) For a period of not less than one (1) year beginning on the Closing Date,
Buyer shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that compensation,
benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment of each Transferred
Employee are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the terms and
conditions under which such individual was employed by the Company or a
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of any service
or employment requirement for eligibility or entitlement under any employee
benefit plan, scheme, or arrangement maintained by Buyer or its affiliates,
service and employment with the Company, the Subsidiaries, the Shareholders,
or their affiliates shall be  



 

-34-  treated as service and employment with Buyer and its affiliates. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any of its affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) shall treat any Transferred Employee as a "new"
employee for purposes of any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements or similar provisions under any
health care or other welfare benefit plan of Buyer or its affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) to which such employee is transferred
after the Effective Time (the " _Successor Plans_ "), and Buyer and such
affiliates will make appropriate arrangements with each applicable insurance
carrier to ensure such result. Accordingly, all Successor Plans of Buyer or
its affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) in which the Transferred
Employees participate after the Effective Time shall, to the fullest extent
allowed by law, provide coverage for pre-existing health conditions to the
same extent those conditions were covered under the applicable plans or
programs of the Company in effect for them immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods shall accordingly be waived with respect to their
participation and coverage under the Successor Plans. In addition, each
Transferred Employee shall be credited with any co-payments and deductibles
paid during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to transfer to the
Successor Plans for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any Successor Plans to which such employee is
transferred, as if those deductibles or co-payments had in fact been paid
under those Successor Plans.

7.5  _Consents_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as possible the third
party consents listed on _Schedule 7.5_ hereto. Buyer shall cooperate with
the Companys efforts to obtain such assignments, permits, and consents. In
addition to the foregoing, the Company and Buyer shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, proper,
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company shall promptly notify
Buyer of any material inaccuracies in the Companys representations
and warranties set forth in Article III.

(b) Buyer shall promptly deliver written notice to the Company if Buyer has
been notified or if it reasonably believes that any of its representations
and warranties as set forth in Section 5.5 are no longer true and correct or
will not be true and correct as of the Closing Date.

7.7 _Officers and Directors Liability_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
present or former officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
present or former officer, director, or trustee of any Benefit Plan (each, an
" _Officer_ ") from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
judgments, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines and settlements in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
claim, action, suit,  



 

-35-  proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date (including any which arise out of
or relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether
asserted or commenced prior to or after the Closing Date (each, a " _D andO
Claim_"), to the full extent required or permitted by the provisions as in
effect on the date hereof (the " _Indemnification Provisions_ ") of the
Companys and the Subsidiaries charter or organizational documents or
pursuant to law with respect to the indemnification of Officers; (ii) advance
expenses to the Officers in connection with each DandO Claim to the full extent
required by the Indemnification Provisions; (iii) honor the Indemnification
Provisions as contract rights in favor of the Officers, with respect to any
DandO Claim; and (iv) for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, maintain
director and officer liability insurance which insurance shall provide
coverage for the individuals who were Officers of the Company or the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing comparable to the policy or policies
maintained by the Company and the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing for the benefit of such individuals.

(b) All rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of the Officers
as provided in the Companys and the Subsidiaries organizational documents
on the date hereof shall be maintained in such documents and shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. 

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the parties described in this Section
7.7, their heirs and their personal representatives and shall be binding on
all successors and permitted assigns of the Company, the Subsidiaries and
Buyer. Buyer shall cause the surviving or resulting entity of any merger,
consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or the Subsidiaries
resulting in such loss of control to assume the obligations imposed by this
Section 7.7.

7.8 _Efforts to Obtain Funding_.

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing sufficient to effect the Closing on a targeted date of November 15,
2006. If at any time it becomes reasonably likely that Buyer will be unable
for any reason to consummate the Financing on the terms set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain replacement financing, provided that
Buyer shall not be required to accept terms that are materially less
favorable in the aggregate to the Buyer than those set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt,
a decision by the Buyer to begin the process of marketing the Financing after
it has had a reasonable opportunity to incorporate the Companys financial
statements for the periods ending September 30, 2006 shall be deemed to be
commercially reasonable.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in subsection
(a) above, but subject to the last sentence thereof Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions which are set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter to be fulfilled in
accordance with their terms as soon as reasonably practicable. Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use its  



 

-36-  commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives to, deliver all
documents and instruments reasonably necessary to satisfy the conditions
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter and
assist with the syndication or marketing of the financing contemplated
thereby.

(c) Buyer shall not amend, modify or change any provision in either the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter in any respect adverse to the
Company without the prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that the Buyer may
agree to amend the Debt Commitment Letter to provide for the assignment of a
portion of the debt commitment to additional agents or arrangers and, without
adding any additional conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter, granting such
persons approval rights with respect to certain matters as are customarily
granted to additional agents or arrangers), and Buyer shall draw down on the
financings referred to in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letter when the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied.

(d) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to
provide, all reasonable cooperation (including with respect to timeliness)
in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Buyer and its financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, (iii) satisfying the conditions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter (to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions
requires actions by or cooperation of the Company), (iv) assisting Buyer and
its financing sources in the preparation of an offering document or customary
marketing materials for any of the Debt Financing, (v) reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Buyer and its financing sources for any of the
Debt Financing, (vi) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, and
(vii) using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain legal opinions,
surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer.

Miscellaneous

termination only as follows:

(a) By mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

(b) By Buyer if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred which if uncured would cause any condition set forth in Section
8.2(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured;



 

-42- (c) By the Company if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have

respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not

(e) By either Buyer or the Company, if the Closing has not occurred on or
before December 1, 2006 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless the reason that the

the foregoing, the Outside Date shall be automatically extended to December
15, 2006 if Buyer is involved in an active financing process.

executors, heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.

unless it is made in writing and signed by the party waiving the condition.
No failure by either party hereto to take any action with respect to any
breach of this Agreement or default by the other party shall constitute a
waiver of such partys right to enforce any provision of this Agreement
