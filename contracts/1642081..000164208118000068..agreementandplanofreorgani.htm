AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of such premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as set forth below.

ARTICLE 1.

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined herein), the Company
shall be merged with and into Allegiance, with Allegiance continuing as the
surviving corporation (which, as the surviving corporation, is hereinafter
referred to as "Continuing Corporation" whenever reference is made to it at or
after the Effective Time) pursuant to, and with the effect provided for in,
the applicable provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code.

Section 1.2 Organizational Documents and Facilities of Continuing Corporation.
At the Effective Time and until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable law, the Organizational Documents of Continuing Corporation shall
be the Organizational Documents (as defined herein) of Allegiance as in effect
at the Effective Time. Unless and until changed by the board of directors of
Continuing Corporation, the main office of Continuing Corporation shall be the
main office of Allegiance as of the Effective Time. The established offices
and facilities of the Company immediately prior to the Merger shall become
established offices and facilities of Continuing Corporation. Until thereafter
changed in accordance with law or the Organizational Documents of Continuing
Corporation, all corporate acts, plans, policies, contracts, approvals and
authorizations of the Company and Allegiance and their respective
shareholders, boards of directors, committees elected or appointed thereby,
officers and agents, which were valid and effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be taken for all purposes as the acts, plans, policies,
contracts, approvals and authorizations of Continuing Corporation and shall be
as effective and binding thereon as the same were with respect to the Company
and Allegiance, respectively, as of the Effective Time.

Section 1.3 Board of Directors and Officers of Continuing Corporation. Subject
to Section 6.9, at the Effective Time and until thereafter changed in
accordance with applicable law and the Organizational Documents of Continuing
Corporation, the members of the board of directors of Allegiance at the
Effective Time shall be the board of directors of Continuing Corporation. At
the Effective Time and until thereafter changed in accordance with applicable
law and the Organizational Documents of Continuing Corporation, the senior
officers of Allegiance immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
senior officers of Continuing Corporation.

Section 1.4 Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, the corporate existence
of the Company and Allegiance shall, as provided in the provisions of law
heretofore mentioned, be consolidated and continued in Continuing Corporation,
and Continuing Corporation shall be deemed to be a continuation in entity and
identity of the Company and Allegiance. All rights, franchises and interests
of the Company and Allegiance, respectively, in and to any type of property
and choses in action shall be transferred to and vested in Continuing
Corporation by virtue of the Merger without reversion or impairment, without
further act or deed and without any assignment having occurred, 

but subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon. The Merger
shall have all other effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
Texas Business Organizations Code.

Section 1.5 Liabilities of Continuing Corporation. At the Effective Time,
Continuing Corporation shall be liable for all Liabilities (as defined herein)
of the Company and Allegiance. All Liabilities and obligations of the Company
and of Allegiance, respectively, matured or unmatured, whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not reflected or reserved
against on balance sheets, books of account, or records of the Company or
Allegiance, as the case may be, shall be those of Continuing Corporation and
shall not be released or impaired by the Merger. All rights of creditors and
other obligees and all liens on property of either the Company or Allegiance
shall be preserved unimpaired subsequent to the Merger.

Section 1.6 Approvals and Notices. This Agreement shall be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company and Allegiance in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the applicable provisions of law and the Organizational
Documents of the Company and Allegiance. The Company and Allegiance shall
proceed with commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate fully in the
procurement of any other consents and approvals and the taking of any other
actions in satisfaction of all other requirements prescribed by law or
otherwise necessary for consummation of the Merger on the terms herein
provided, including the preparation and submission of all necessary filings,
requests for waivers, notices and certificates with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Texas Department of Banking (the "TDB"), and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC").

Section 1.7 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code (and any comparable provision of state law), and the parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Sections 1.368‑2(g) and 1.368‑3(a) of the Treasury Regulations.

Section 1.8 Modification of Structure. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Allegiance may elect, subject to the filing of all
necessary applications and the receipt of all required regulatory approvals,
to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated hereby so long as (i)
there are no material adverse federal income tax consequences to the
shareholders of the Company as a result of such modification, (ii) the
consideration to be paid to holders of Company Stock under this Agreement is
not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount solely because of such
modification and (iii) such modification will not be likely to materially
delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals. In the event

ARTICLE II.

CONSIDERATION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

Section 2.1 Merger Consideration.

(a) No effect on outstanding Allegiance Common Stock. Each share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Allegiance ("Allegiance Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(b) Conversion of Company Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares (as such terms are
defined herein)) shall automatically, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and
represent only the right to receive from Allegiance, without interest, a
number of shares of Allegiance Common Stock equal to the number set forth as
the Exchange Ratio in Section 2.1(f)(iii), plus cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Allegiance Common Stock as determined in accordance with Section
2.1(e) (the "Per Share Merger Consideration").

(c) Cancellation of Treasury Shares. Each share of Company Stock held in the
treasury of the Company and each share of Company Stock owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined herein) of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Treasury Shares") (other than
(i) shares of Company Stock held, directly or indirectly, in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that
are beneficially owned by third parties and (ii) shares of Company Stock held
in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled without any
conversion and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

(d) Assumption of Company Stock Options.

(i) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Stock that
is unexpired, outstanding and unexercised under the Post Oak Bancshares, Inc.
Stock Option Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") or any individual stock
option award agreement to purchase shares of Company Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, assumed by Allegiance and converted
into an option to purchase shares of Allegiance Common Stock (each, a
"Converted Stock Option"). Each Converted Stock Option shall continue to have
and be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions after the
Effective Time as were applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the terms and conditions relating to
vesting and the post-termination exercise period, provided that a Converted
Stock Option shall not give the optionee additional benefits that the optionee
did not have under the applicable Company Stock Option, with the intention
that such assumption satisfy the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.424-1 and 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as not to be considered a modification of
the Company Stock Option, to retain, where applicable and possible, the tax
and accounting treatment of each 

such Company Stock Option (including any Company Stock Options that are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code) and not to be treated as a change in the form of payment or
as nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code (the "Per
Option Merger Consideration"). Section 2.1(d)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules
(as defined below) sets forth an example of how an existing Company Stock
Option will be converted into a Converted Stock Option based on the foregoing.

(ii) The exercise price and number of shares of Allegiance Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to each such Converted Stock Option shall be determined as
follows: (A) the number of shares of Allegiance Common Stock subject to each
such Converted Stock Option shall be equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio, and (B) the per-
share exercise price of each such Converted Stock Option shall be equal to the
quotient, rounded to the nearest cent, of (1) the exercise price per share of
Company Stock of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Allegiance
will not assume and convert a Company Stock Option into a Converted Stock
Option representing the right to purchase any fractional share of Allegiance
Common Stock. In lieu of the assumption and conversion of a Converted Stock
Option to purchase such fractional share, Allegiance shall pay a cash payment
determined by multiplying (A) the difference between (1) the Average Closing
Price and (2) the exercise price of such Converted Stock Option by (B) the
fraction of a share of Allegiance Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive upon the exercise of such Converted Stock
Option.

(e) No Fractional Shares of Allegiance Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Allegiance will not issue any fractional
shares of Allegiance Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger.
In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional shares, Allegiance shall pay to
each former holder of Company Stock otherwise entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Average
Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Allegiance Common Stock which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
2.1.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(i) "Aggregate Merger Consideration" means the Aggregate Stock Consideration
plus all cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Allegiance Common Stock
as determined in accordance with Section 2.1(e).

(ii) "Aggregate Stock Consideration" means the sum of (A) the number of shares
of Allegiance Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(b) plus (B)
the number of shares of Allegiance Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Converted Stock Options provided for by Section 2.1(d), unless adjusted
pursuant to Section 9.1(g). 

(iii) "Average Closing Price" means the average of the closing price per share
of Allegiance Common Stock on The NASDAQ Global Market ("NASDAQ") (as reported
by Bloomberg or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as chosen
by Allegiance and reasonably acceptable to the Company) for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on and including the fifth (5th) trading day
preceding the Closing Date.

(iv) "Exchange Ratio" means 0.7017. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Exchange Ratio was determined using (A) the number of outstanding shares of
Company Stock, (B) the number of outstanding Company Stock Options and (C) the
average weighted price of outstanding Company Stock Options as of the date of
this Agreement. If any of (A)-(C) is inaccurate in any respect, the parties
agree that the Exchange Ratio will be revised to correct for such inaccuracy.

Section 2.2 Anti-Dilutive Adjustment. The aggregate number of shares of
Allegiance Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of Company Stock shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect any change in the number of shares of
Allegiance Common Stock by reason of any stock dividends or splits,
reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with respect to Allegiance
Common Stock, received or to be received by holders of Allegiance Common
Stock, when the record date or payment therefor occurs prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, this Section 2.2 shall not apply to the issuance of
Allegiance Common Stock in exchange for the payment of cash consideration.

Section 2.3 Adjustment to Merger Consideration for Tangible Equity Capital.

(a) If the Tangible Equity Capital (as defined below) as of the fifth (5th)
Business Day preceding the Closing Date (the "Calculation Date") is less than
the amount ("Minimum Equity") indicated for such date in Section 2.3(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Aggregate Merger Consideration will be reduced on a
dollar-by-dollar basis by an amount equal to the difference between the
Minimum Equity and the Tangible Equity Capital on the Calculation Date. The
reduction will be made by subtracting (i) the number of shares of Allegiance
Common Stock equal to the value of the quotient of such deficiency divided by
the Average Closing Price (rounded to the nearest whole number) from (ii) the
Aggregate Stock Consideration.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tangible Equity Capital" shall equal the
sum of the common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings of the Company
as determined pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
minus goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization,
on a consolidated basis. For purposes of calculating Tangible Equity Capital,
the Company shall include adjustments made for certain extraordinary items
related to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including deductions for (i) the after-tax amount of all costs,
expenses and fees related to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any amounts required to be added to the Company's
allowance for loan losses pursuant to Section 5.9, (iii) the after-tax amount
of the premium or additional cost incurred to provide for the continuation of
certain of the Company's insurance policies pursuant to Section 5.8, (iv) the
after-tax amount of any penalty or liquidated damages associated with the
termination of the Company's contracts with any provider of electronic banking
and data processing services prior to or following the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 

5.6, (v) the amount of the accrual through the Closing Date in accordance with
GAAP, and confirmed by a third-party consultant mutually acceptable to the
Company and Allegiance, of any future benefit payments due under any salary
continuation, deferred compensation or other similar agreements, (vi) the
after-tax amount of any cost to fully fund and liquidate any Company Plan (as
defined herein) and to pay all related expenses and fees to the extent such
termination is requested by Allegiance pursuant to Section 7.4, (vii) the
after-tax amount of any payments to be made pursuant to any existing
employment, change in control, salary continuation, deferred compensation or
other similar agreements or severance, noncompetition, retention or bonus
arrangements between the Company or the Bank and any other Person, (viii) the
after-tax amount of any capitalized, unaccrued or prepaid software contracts,
(ix) the after-tax amount of the accrual for outstanding litigation
contemplated by Section 10.1(i), (x) the after-tax amount of the accrual
required to address or remediate any Unresolved Response Action pursuant to
Section 5.12(c), (xi) the after-tax amount of the accrual required to address
or remediate a finding or request of a Governmental Body pursuant to Section
5.16 and (xii) the after-tax amount of any fees and commissions payable to any
broker, finder, financial advisor or investment banking firm in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, for
purposes of calculating Tangible Equity Capital, the Company will deduct the
amount of any cash paid upon the exercise of a Company Stock Option between
the date hereof and the Calculation Date. If a Company Stock Option is
exercised after the Calculation Date but prior to the Closing Date, the
Tangible Equity Capital will be recalculated to reflect such exercise.

Section 2.4 Dissenting Shares. Each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder of which has
not voted in favor of nor consented in writing to the approval of the Merger
and who has properly perfected his dissenter's rights of appraisal by
following the exact procedure required by Chapter 10, Subchapter H of the
Texas Business Organizations Code is referred to herein as a "Dissenting
Share." Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Dissenting Share shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE II and shall be
entitled only to such rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the value of such Dissenting
Shares held by him in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Texas
Business Organizations Code; provided, such holder complies with the
procedures contemplated by and set forth in the applicable provisions of the
Texas Business Organizations Code. If any holder of any Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose his dissenter's rights under the applicable
provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code, each such Dissenting
Share shall be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions of this ARTICLE
II.

Section 2.5 Exchange of Shares.

(a) Allegiance shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with
Computershare Investor Services, Inc. (the "Exchange Agent") (i) book entry
shares of Allegiance Common Stock in an amount sufficient to satisfy the
Aggregate Stock Consideration and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient
to make the appropriate payments (A) to holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Section 2.4, if any, and (B) to holders of a fraction of a share of
Allegiance Common Stock 

pursuant to Section 2.1(e) (such shares and cash being referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
except as provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates,
which as of the Effective Time represented shares of Company Stock (the
"Certificates"), a letter of transmittal that will specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, include
standard representations and warranties on behalf of the record holder, and
contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate(s) will have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the "Transmittal Materials"). Upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the
Transmittal Materials duly completed and executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the allocable
portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, as
may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.3, and such Certificate shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued with respect to the shares
of Allegiance Common Stock or cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates.
Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5, after
the Effective Time, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Treasury Shares, which shall be treated as provided in Section 2.1(c), or
Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated as provided in Section 2.4) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the allocable portion of
the Aggregate Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to shares of Allegiance Common Stock and payable to the holders
thereof shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder
surrenders such Certificate and duly completed and executed Transmittal
Materials to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.5. After the
surrender of a Certificate and duly completed and executed Transmittal
Materials in accordance with this Section 2.5, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
interest thereon, which had become payable after the Effective Time with
respect to the shares of Allegiance Common Stock issuable in respect of such
Certificate.

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of the Company shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to Allegiance, they shall be promptly presented to the Exchange
Agent for exchange as provided in this Section 2.5.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company
for six (6) months after the Exchange Agent mails the Transmittal Materials
pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be returned to Allegiance upon demand, and
any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures in this Section 2.5 shall look to Allegiance only, and not
the Exchange Agent, for the payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares. 

(f) If any shares of Allegiance Common Stock are to be issued in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form
(reasonably satisfactory to Allegiance) for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Allegiance Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(g) None of Allegiance, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Stock for any
Allegiance Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Allegiance or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Allegiance or
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Allegiance with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the allocable portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

to the extent that the Company or the ERISA Affiliate is contractually
obligated to make payments to the Company PEO for coverage under such Company
PEO Plan. As of the date of this Agreement, all such payments have been made
or accrued for. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened Proceedings, audits or other claims (except routine claims for
benefits) relating to any Company Plan. All of the Company Plans comply and
have been administered in all material respects with their terms and with all
applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. There
has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in § 406 of ERISA or §
4975 of the Code) with respect to the Company Plans which is likely to result
in the imposition of any penalties or Taxes upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under § 502(i) of ERISA or § 4975 of the Code. All contributions,
premiums or other payments required by law or by any Company Plan have been
made by the due date thereof.

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities for
post-retirement or post-employment welfare benefits under any Company Plan,
except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or § 4980B of the
Code, or similar state laws, the cost of which is borne by the insured
individuals. Each Company Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is qualified in form and
operation and no event or circumstance has occurred that would disqualify any
such Company Plan. The Company has provided or made available copies of (i)
each Company Plan, including all amendments thereto, (ii) the most recent
summary plan descriptions of each Company Plan, (iii) each trust agreement,
insurance policy or other instrument relating to the funding or administration
of any Company Plan, (iv) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500
series) and accompanying schedules filed with 

the IRS or the United States Department of Labor with respect to each Company
Plan, (v) the most recent determination letter issued by the IRS with respect
to each Company Plan that is intended to qualify under § 401 of the Code, (vi)
the most recent available financial statements for each Company Plan, and
(vii) the most recent audited financial statements for each Company Plan for
which audited statements are required by ERISA.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any Liability with respect
to a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of § 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
("Multiemployer Plans"). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, and
neither the Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal
liability under Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA that has not been
satisfied in full. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors,
maintains or contributes to any employee benefit plan that is subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA.

(d) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any Controlled Group Liability (as defined herein) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries now or following the Closing.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.21(e) of the Disclosure Schedules, there
are no outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company which were
distributed to any current shareholder from the ESOP, or if such shares were
distributed and are now outstanding, the holder thereof no longer has any
"put" rights with respect to such shares under the ESOP entitling the holder
to require the Company to purchase such shares.

(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.21(f) of the Disclosure Schedules, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event (where such other event by
itself would not result in such consequence), (i) entitle any current or
former employee, director, officer, consultant or other service provider of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, retention bonuses,
parachute payments, non-competition payments, unemployment compensation or any
other payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due to any current or former employee,
director, officer, consultant or other service provider of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (whether by virtue of any termination, severance, change
of control or similar benefits or otherwise), (iii) cause the Company to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Plan,
or (iv) limit or restrict the right to amend, terminate, or transfer the
assets of any Company Plan on or following the Effective Time. There is no
contract, agreement, plan or other arrangement covering any service provider
or former service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, could give rise to the payment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of § 162(m) or § 280G of the Code.

(g) Section 3.21(g) of the Disclosure Schedules lists each Person who (i) as

promulgated thereunder) with respect to the Company 

or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) who could reasonably be expected to
receive an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of § 280G of the Code
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law). The Company has made available to Allegiance calculations prepared by
Longnecker and Associates, using reasonable good faith assumptions, which
estimates potential "parachute payments" (within the meaning of §
280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) to "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning
of § 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to any payment or benefit made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) Section 3.21(h) of the Disclosure Schedules lists each plan under which
compensatory equity awards, including any arrangements awarding stock options,
stock appreciation rights, stock appreciation units, restricted stock,
deferred stock, phantom stock or any other equity compensation may be granted
to any employee, director or other service provider of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate and the holders and corresponding number of awards issued and
outstanding under each such plan.

Section 3.22 Deferred Compensation, Salary Continuation, and Other Post-
Retirement Benefit Arrangements. Neither the Company nor the Bank is a party

post-employment benefits to any director, officer, employee or contractor of
the Company or the Bank.

Section 3.23 Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors. Other than as set forth
in Section 3.23 of the Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company, any of its

banker or incurred any Liability for any brokerage, financial advisory,
investment banking or other similar fees or commissions in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

financial statements in conformity with GAAP consistently applied with respect
to institutions such as it or other criteria applicable to such financial
statements, and to maintain accountability for items therein; (c) control of
the properties and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries is permitted
only in accordance with general or specific authorization of its board of
directors (or similar management body) and/or its duly authorized executive
officers; and (d) the recorded accountability for items is compared with the
actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate actions taken with
respect to any differences.

agreement, or any other contract or agreement not included in the Company
Financial Statements which is a financial derivative contract (including
various combinations thereof). 

Section 3.26 Deposits. Except as listed in Section 3.26 of the Disclosure
Schedules, no deposit of the Bank is a "brokered" deposit (as such term is
defined in 12 C.F.R. § 337.6(a)(2)) or is subject to any encumbrance, legal
restraint or other legal process (other than garnishments, pledges, set off
rights, escrow limitations and similar actions taken in the ordinary course of
business).

(a) Section 3.27(a) of the Disclosure Schedules contains a correct and
complete list of all registered trademarks, registered service marks,
trademark and service mark applications, trade names and registered copyrights
presently owned or held by the Company or any Subsidiary or used in a material
manner by them in the conduct of their business under license pursuant to a

periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Allegiance's internal controls over financial reporting.

Subsidiaries. There is no material unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any bank regulatory agency with respect to any report relating to
any examinations of Allegiance or Allegiance Bank.

(c) Allegiance has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance relating to
Allegiance or any of its Subsidiaries that would materially impede or delay
receipt of any required regulatory approval of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Bank Merger, nor

all requisite regulatory and other approvals or consents which it is required
to obtain in order to consummate the Merger and the Bank Merger.

each of such reports and statements (a) complied in all material respects as
to form with the applicable requirements under the Exchange Act and (b) were
true and correct and complied in all material respects with the relevant
statutes, rules and regulations enforced or promulgated by the SEC and such
reports did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that has not had and is not

Returns were correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes due and
owing by Allegiance or any Subsidiary and any affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group of which either Allegiance or any Subsidiary is or
was a member (whether or not 

shown on any Tax Return) have been paid. Neither Allegiance nor any Subsidiary
is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return. No claim has ever been raised in writing by an authority in a
jurisdiction where Allegiance or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that
Allegiance or any Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by that

to the appropriate Governmental Body all Taxes required to have been collected
or withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,

authority.

Allegiance and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502‑6 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract, or otherwise.

(e) Neither Allegiance nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to
disclose on its federal income Tax Returns any position that could give rise
to a substantial understatement of federal income tax within the meaning of §
6662 of the Code.

(f) Neither Allegiance nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any fact or
circumstance that reasonably could be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Allegiance has not taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent
or reasonably could be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

rescinded.


ARTICLE V.

COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

The Company covenants and agrees with Allegiance as follows:

Section 5.1 Approval of Shareholders of the Company; Efforts.

(a) The Company will, as soon as practicable, take all steps under applicable
laws and its Organizational Documents necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a special meeting of the Company's shareholders to be called
to consider the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") at such time as may be mutually
agreed to by the parties for the purpose of (i) considering and voting upon
the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) for such other purposes consistent with the complete performance of this
Agreement as may be necessary and desirable. The board of directors of the
Company shall recommend to the shareholders of the Company the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
not withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in a manner adverse to
Allegiance (a "Change in Recommendation") and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by the Company's
shareholders of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Company Shareholder Approval"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company
has complied with Section 5.5(a), the board of directors of the Company may
effect a Change in Recommendation if the Company or any of its representatives
receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal before the Company
Shareholder Approval that the board of directors of the Company has (i)
determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Financial

Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Proposal (as defined herein), and (ii) determined in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel) that
the failure to effect a Change in Recommendation would cause it to violate its

Merger, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be

Section 5.4 Information for Regulatory Applications and SEC Filings.

(a) To the extent permitted by law and during the pendency of this Agreement,
the Company will furnish Allegiance with all information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries required for inclusion in any application,
filing, statement or document to be made or filed by Allegiance with any
Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any filings with the SEC and any applicable state securities
authorities. The Company will fully cooperate with Allegiance in the filing of
any applications or other documents 

necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company agrees at any time, upon the request of Allegiance, to furnish to
Allegiance a written letter or statement confirming the accuracy of the
information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contained
in any report or other application or statement referred to in this Agreement,
and confirming that the information with respect to the Company and its

expressly for use therein or, if such is not the case, indicating the
inaccuracies contained in such document or indicating the information not
furnished by the Company expressly for use therein.

connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of the

the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, and (ii) the Registration Statement (as defined herein) will,
at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement

Section 5.5 Standstill Provision.

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
they shall instruct their respective directors, officers, agents or
representatives not to, directly or indirectly take any action to solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate the making of any inquiries with respect to,
or provide any information to, conduct any assessment of or negotiate with any
other party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein) or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.5(a), if the Company
has complied with Section 5.5(a) and the Company or any of its representatives
receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal before the Company
Shareholder Approval that the Company Board has (i) determined in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with the Company's financial advisors set
forth in Section 3.23 of the Disclosure Schedules or a nationally recognized
investment firm (the "Financial Advisor"), and the Company's outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, (ii) determined in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would cause, or would be reasonably expected
to cause, it to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (iii)
obtained from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement that is no
less protective of the Company's confidential information than 

the Letter of Intent (as defined herein), then the Company or its
representatives may furnish information to and enter into discussions and
negotiations with such other Person.

(c) The Company agrees to notify Allegiance in writing within three (3)
Business Days, after receipt of any unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and
provide reasonable detail as to the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
that relate to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will, and will cause the
Bank to, take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate Persons referred
to in this Section 5.5 of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.5.

Section 5.6 Termination of Data Processing Contracts. The Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts, including notifying appropriate parties and
negotiating in good faith a reasonable settlement, to ensure that, if
requested by Allegiance, each contract listed on Section 5.6 of the Disclosure
Schedules will, if the Merger occurs, be terminated after the consummation of
the Merger on a date to be mutually agreed upon by Allegiance and the Company;
provided, however, that until the thirtieth (30th) day prior to Closing,
Allegiance shall have the right to add to Section 5.6 of the Disclosure
Schedules any data processing contracts and contracts related to the provision
of electronic banking services of the Company or the Bank not then listed on
Section 5.6 of the Disclosure Schedules. Such notice and actions by the
Company will be in accordance with the terms of such contracts. For the
avoidance of doubt, the use of "commercially reasonable efforts" by the
Company as used in this Section 5.6 shall include the payment of any
termination fees or liquidated damages required by the terms of the contracts
referenced in this Section 5.6 upon the termination of such contracts.

Section 5.7 Conforming Accounting Adjustments. If requested by Allegiance, the
Company shall and shall cause the Bank to, consistent with GAAP, immediately
prior to Closing, make such accounting entries as Allegiance may reasonably
request in order to conform the accounting records of the Company and the Bank
to the accounting policies and practices of Allegiance and Allegiance Bank,
respectively. No such adjustment shall by itself constitute or be deemed to be
a breach, violation or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, condition or other provision or constitute grounds for termination
of this Agreement or be an acknowledgment by the Company or the Bank (a) of
any adverse circumstances for purposes of determining whether the conditions
to Allegiance's obligations under this Agreement have been satisfied or (b)
that such adjustment has any bearing on the Aggregate Merger Consideration. No
adjustment required by Allegiance shall (y) require any prior filing with any
Governmental Body or (z) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company or the Bank.

Section 5.8 Liability Insurance. The Company shall purchase for a period of
not less than four (4) years after the Effective Time, past acts and extended
reporting period insurance coverage for no less than the four-year period
immediately preceding the Effective Time under its (a) current directors and
officers insurance (or comparable coverage), (b) employment practices
liability insurance, (c) current financial institutions bond (or comparable
coverage) and (d) bankers professional liability, mortgage errors and
omissions and fiduciary liability insurance for each of the directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries currently covered under
comparable policies held by the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

Section 5.9 Allowance for Loan Losses. The Company shall cause the Bank to
maintain its allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with the Bank's
historical methodology, past practices, existing policies and in compliance
with GAAP and, at a minimum, on the Business Day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, the sum of (i) the allowance for loan losses of the Bank and
(ii) the ASC 310-30 purchase discount on purchased loans shall be at least
1.0% of total loans (subject to any adjustment for any reduction in the
allowance for loan losses specifically allocated to those previously
identified impaired loans set forth on Section 5.9 of the Disclosure
Schedules) (the "Minimum Allowance Amount"); provided, however, that if the
allowance for loan losses is less than the Minimum Allowance Amount on the
Calculation Date, the Company shall take or cause to be taken all action
necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses to an amount equal to the
Minimum Allowance Amount as of the Calculation Date and any such increase
shall be accounted for in the calculation of Tangible Equity Capital for
purposes of Section 2.3(b).

Section 5.10 Third Party Consents. The Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts, and Allegiance shall reasonably cooperate with the Company
at the Company's request, to provide all required notices and obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
in Section 3.4 of the Disclosure Schedules.

Section 5.11 Coordination; Integration.

(a) The senior officers of the Company and the Bank agree to meet with senior
officers of Allegiance and Allegiance Bank, on a weekly basis or as reasonably
requested by Allegiance, relating to the development, coordination and
implementation of the post-Merger operating and integration plans of
Allegiance Bank, as the resulting institution in the Bank Merger and to
otherwise review the financial and operational affairs of the Company and the
Bank; provided, that Allegiance and Allegiance Bank shall have no right to
review confidential supervisory information (as such term is defined in 12
C.F.R. § 261.2) of the Company or the Bank, and to the extent permitted by
applicable law, each of the Company and the Bank agrees to give reasonable
consideration to Allegiance's input on such matters, consistent with this
Section 5.11, with the understanding that Allegiance shall in no event be
permitted to exercise control of the Company or the Bank prior to the
Effective Time and, except as specifically provided under this Agreement, the
Company and the Bank shall have no obligation to act in accordance with
Allegiance's input.

(b) Commencing after the date hereof and to the extent permitted by applicable
law, Allegiance, Allegiance Bank, the Company and the Bank shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to plan the integration of the Company and the
Bank with the businesses of Allegiance and their respective Affiliates to be
effective as much as practicable as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that in no event shall Allegiance or its Affiliates be entitled to control the
Company or the Bank prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from the date hereof through the Effective Time
and consistent with the performance of their day-to-day operations and the
continuous operation of the Company and the Bank in the ordinary course of
business, the Company's and the Bank's employees and officers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide support, including support from the
Company's and the Bank's outside contractors, and to assist Allegiance in
performing all tasks, including equipment installation, reasonably required to
result in a successful integration at the Closing; provided, however, that no
integration shall take place prior to the Closing. Allegiance shall provide
such assistance of its 

personnel as the Company and the Bank shall request to permit the Company and
the Bank to comply with their obligations under this Section 5.11.

Section 5.12 Environmental Investigation; Rights to Terminate Agreement.

(a) Allegiance and its consultants, agents and representatives shall have the
right to the same extent that the Company or the Bank has such right (at
Allegiance's cost and expense), but not the obligation or responsibility, to
inspect any Company or Bank property, including conducting asbestos surveys
and sampling, environmental assessments and investigation, and other non-
invasive or non-destructive environmental surveys and analyses ("Environmental
Inspections") at any time on or prior to forty-five (45) days after the date
of this Agreement. If, as a result of any such Environmental Inspection,
further investigation ("Secondary Investigation") including test borings,
soil, water, asbestos or other sampling, is deemed desirable by Allegiance,
Allegiance shall (i) notify the Company of any property for which it intends
to conduct such a Secondary Investigation and the reasons for such Secondary
Investigation, (ii) submit a work plan to the Company for such Secondary
Investigation, for which Allegiance agrees to afford the Company the ability
to comment on and Allegiance agrees to reasonably consider all such comments
(and negotiate in good faith any such comments), and (iii) conclude such
Secondary Investigation, on or prior to sixty (60) days after the date of
receipt of the Company's comments. Allegiance shall give reasonable notice to
the Company of such Secondary Investigations, and the Company may place
reasonable restrictions on the time and place at which such Secondary
Investigations may be carried out.

(b) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Allegiance for any
claims for damage to property, or injury or death to persons, made as a result
of any Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation conducted by
Allegiance or its agents, representatives or contractors to the extent
attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or
its agents, representatives or contractors. Allegiance agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company for any claims for damage to property, or injury or
death to persons made as a result of any Environmental Inspection or Secondary
Investigation conducted by Allegiance or its agents, representatives or
contractors, to the extent attributable to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Allegiance or its agents, representatives or contractors in
performing any Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation. If the
Closing does not occur, the foregoing indemnities shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. Allegiance shall not have any Liability or
responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other
findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or
other environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated, then, except as
otherwise required by law, reports to any Governmental Body of the results of
any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey shall be made by the Company in the exercise of its sole discretion and
not by Allegiance. Allegiance shall make no such report prior to Closing
unless required to do so by law, and in such case will give the Company
reasonable prior written notice of Allegiance's intentions so as to enable the
Company to review and comment on such proposed report.

(c) To the extent that Allegiance identifies any past or present events,
conditions or circumstances that would require further investigation, remedial
or cleanup action under Environmental Laws, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable best efforts to take and complete any such reporting,
remediation or other response actions prior to Closing; provided, 

however, that, to the extent any such response actions have not been completed
prior to Closing ("Unresolved Response Action"), the Company shall include the
after-tax amount of the costs expected to be incurred by the Continuing
Corporation on or after the Closing Date, as determined by an independent
third party with recognized expertise in environmental clean-up matters, to
fully complete all Unresolved Response Actions in determining its Tangible
Equity Capital pursuant to Section 2.3(b).

(d) Allegiance shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within ninety
(90) days after the date of this Agreement if (i) the results of such
Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other environmental
survey are disapproved by Allegiance because the Environmental Inspection,
Secondary Investigation or other environmental survey identifies violations or
potential violations of Environmental Laws that are reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (ii) any past or present
events, conditions or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
require further investigation, remedial or cleanup action under Environmental
Laws involving an expenditure reasonably expected by Allegiance to exceed
$1,000,000 or that is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company or the Bank; (iii) the Environmental Inspection, Secondary
Investigation or other environmental survey identifies the presence of any
underground or above ground storage tank in, on or under any Company Real
Property that is not shown to be in compliance with all Environmental Laws
applicable to such tank, or that has had a release of petroleum or some other
Hazardous Materials that has not been remediated in accordance with applicable
Environmental Law; or (iv) the Environmental Inspection, Secondary
Investigation or other environmental survey identifies the presence of any
asbestos-containing material or mold in, on or under any Company Real
Property, the removal or abatement of which would reasonably be expected to
involve an expenditure in excess of $1,000,000 or that is reasonably likely to
result a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. In the event Allegiance
terminates this Agreement or elects not to proceed to Closing pursuant to this
Section 5.12(d), if the Company reimburses Allegiance for the costs of
preparing any Environmental Inspections, Allegiance promptly shall deliver to
the Company copies of any environmental report, engineering report, or
property condition report prepared by Allegiance or any third party with
respect to any Company Real Property. Any results or findings of any
Environmental Inspections will not be disclosed by Allegiance to any third
party not affiliated with Allegiance, unless Allegiance is required by law to
disclose such information.

(e) The Company agrees to make available upon request to Allegiance and its
consultants, agents and representatives all documents and other materials
relating to environmental conditions of any Company Real Property including
the results of other environmental inspections and surveys to the extent such
documents are in the reasonable control of the Company. The Company also
agrees that all engineers and consultants who prepared or furnished such
reports may discuss such reports and information with Allegiance and, at
Allegiance's cost and expense, shall be entitled to certify the same in favor
of Allegiance and its consultants, agents and representatives and make all
other data available to Allegiance and its consultants, agents and
representatives.

Section 5.13 Bank Transaction. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause the Bank to cooperate with Allegiance and Allegiance Bank as necessary
in conjunction with all approvals, filings, and other steps necessary to cause
the consummation of the Bank Merger after the Effective Time. 

Section 5.14 Financial Statements. The consolidated balance sheets as of
future dates and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company for the periods then ended, which may be
provided by the Company to Allegiance subsequent to the date hereof, will be
prepared from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the
Company at the dates and for the periods indicated in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that
unaudited financial statements may (i) omit the footnote disclosure required
by GAAP and (ii) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments required by
GAAP. The Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income filed by the Bank
subsequent to the date hereof will fairly present the financial position of
the Bank and the results of its operations at the dates and for the periods
indicated in compliance with the rules and regulations of applicable federal
and state banking authorities.

Section 5.15 Change in Control Payments. The Company shall and shall cause the
Bank to take all necessary actions to ensure that no payment set forth on
Section 3.21(f) of Disclosure Schedules would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of § 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax law), and be subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.

Section 5.16 Regulatory Matters. The Company shall and shall cause the Bank to
take all necessary actions to address and remediate any findings of or
requests, if any, made by a Governmental Body of the Company or the Bank prior
to Closing, or if not possible to address and remediate such findings or
requests prior to Closing, the Company shall accrue an amount sufficient to
cover expenses reasonably required by Allegiance to timely remediate after the
Merger.

consistent with the complete performance of this Agreement as may be necessary
and desirable. The board of directors of Allegiance shall not withdraw, amend

documents, including the notice, proxy statement and prospectus and other
proxy solicitation materials of the Company constituting a part thereof (the
"Proxy Statement"), relating to the shares of Allegiance Common Stock to be
delivered to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, and
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective. The Company and its counsel shall be given the
opportunity to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement
and shall have the right to approve the content of the Registration Statement
with respect to information about the Company and the meeting of the Company's
shareholders. At the time the Registration Statement becomes effective, the

provisions of the Securities Act and the published rules and regulations
thereunder.

(c) None of the information relating to Allegiance and its Subsidiaries that
is provided by Allegiance for inclusion in (i) the Proxy Statement, any
filings or approvals under applicable federal or state banking laws or
regulations or state securities laws, or any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or
Rule 425 under the Securities Act will, at the time of mailing the Proxy
Statement to the Company's shareholders, at the time of the Allegiance
Shareholder Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading. 

Section 6.3 NASDAQ Listing. Allegiance shall file all documents required to be
filed to have the shares of Allegiance Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
this Agreement included for listing on NASDAQ and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect said listing.

Section 6.4 Affirmative Covenants. Except as otherwise permitted or required
by this Agreement, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, Allegiance
shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (a) maintain its corporate
existence in good standing; (b) maintain the general character of its business
and conduct its business in its ordinary and usual manner; (c) extend credit
only in accordance with its existing lending policies and practices; and (d)
use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve its business organization
intact.

Section 6.5 Negative Covenants. Allegiance shall not, nor shall it permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, (a) amend its Organizational Documents in a manner
that would adversely affect the Company, (b) take, or knowingly fail to take,
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code, (c) take
any action that, to the knowledge of Allegiance, would adversely affect or
delay (i) Allegiance's ability to obtain the necessary approvals of any
Governmental Body required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) Allegiance's ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(d) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 6.6 Employee Matters.

(a) Each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who remains in the
active employment of Allegiance or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
(the "Company Employees") will be entitled to participate as an employee in
the employee benefit plans and programs maintained for employees of Allegiance
and Allegiance Bank with credit for prior service with the Company for all
purposes under the employee welfare benefit plans and other employee benefit
plans and programs (including any severance programs but excluding vesting
requirements under stock incentive plans) sponsored by Allegiance or
Allegiance Bank in which such Company Employee becomes eligible to participate
from and after the Closing Date, to the extent such service was credited under
a comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing, to the extent
permitted by such Allegiance plans and applicable law and to the extent that
such service crediting will not result in any duplication of benefits for the
same period of service. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, each Converted
Stock Option described in Section 2.1(d) shall be vested as of the Effective
Time to the same extent that the corresponding assumed Company Stock Option
was vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent permitted by
such Allegiance plans and applicable law, any eligibility waiting period and
pre-existing condition exclusion applicable to such plans and programs shall
be waived with respect to each Company Employee and their eligible dependents.
To the extent permitted by the applicable Allegiance plans and applicable law,
Allegiance further agrees to credit each Company Employee and his eligible
dependents for the year during which coverage under Allegiance's group health
plan begins, with any deductibles, co-pays or out-of-pocket payments already
incurred by such Company Employee during such year under the Company's group
health plan. For purposes of determining Company Employee's benefits for the
calendar year in which the Merger occurs under Allegiance's vacation program,
any vacation taken by a Company Employee immediately preceding the Closing
Date for the calendar year in 

which the Merger occurs will be deducted from the total Allegiance vacation
benefit available to such Company Employee for such calendar year.

(b) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are for the sole benefit of the parties
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries), other than the parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 6.6) under
or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.6
amends, or will be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination
of), any Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Allegiance or any of its
Affiliates. Allegiance and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to continue
to employ or retain the services of any Company Employee for any period of
time following the Effective Time and Allegiance and its Affiliates will be
entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other
terms or conditions of employment of, any such employees in its absolute
discretion.

Section 6.7 Financial Statements. The consolidated balance sheets as of future
dates and the related statements of income, comprehensive income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows of Allegiance for the periods then ended,
which may be filed by Allegiance with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof,
will be prepared from the books and records of Allegiance and its Subsidiaries
and will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows of
Allegiance at the dates and for the periods indicated in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, except that
unaudited financial statements may (i) omit the footnote disclosure required
by GAAP and (ii) be subject to normal year-end audit adjustments required by
GAAP.

Section 6.8 Issuance of Allegiance Common Stock; Stock Reserves. The shares of
Allegiance Common Stock to be issued by Allegiance to the shareholders of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement will, on the issuance and delivery to such
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. The shares of Allegiance Common Stock to be
issued to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement are and
will be free of any preemptive rights of the shareholders of Allegiance or any
other Person. Allegiance agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement
until the Aggregate Merger Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a
sufficient number of shares of Allegiance Common Stock to fulfill its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) For a period of four (4) years after the date hereof, and subject to the
limitations contained in applicable Federal Reserve Board and FDIC regulations
and to any limitations contained in the Certificate of Formation of the
Company or the Articles of Association of the Bank, Allegiance will indemnify
and hold harmless each present director and officer of the Company or the
Bank, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (each, an
"Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing 

or occurring at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
before, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or
pertaining to the fact that he or she was acting in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or the Bank to the fullest extent that the
Indemnified Party would be entitled under the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company or the Articles of Association of the Bank, as applicable, in each
case as in effect on the date hereof and to the extent permitted by applicable
law.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, is to promptly notify Allegiance, but the failure to so notify
will not relieve Allegiance of any liability it may have to the Indemnified
Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice Allegiance. In any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) Allegiance will have the right to assume the
defense thereof and bear the costs incurred in connection therewith and
Allegiance will not be liable to an Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by an Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Allegiance elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Allegiance and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Allegiance, and Allegiance will promptly pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party as any such fees
and expenses are incurred by such Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one
firm in any jurisdiction), provided that the Indemnified Party for whom fees
and expenses are to be paid provides a signed written undertaking to repay
such amounts if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable laws or regulations, (ii) the Indemnified Party will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) Allegiance will not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv)
Allegiance will have no obligation hereunder if indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations.

(c) If Allegiance fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this
Section 6.9, and, in order to obtain such payment, an Indemnified Party
commences a Proceeding which results in a judgment against Allegiance for
failure to provide indemnification, Allegiance shall pay the costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Party (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such Proceeding.

Section 6.10 Director Nomination. Contemporaneously with Closing, the board of
directors of Allegiance shall expand the board by three, with one new vacancy
created in each class of Allegiance's staggered board, and fill such newly
created vacancies with Mr. Roland L. Williams and two (2) of the outside
directors of the board of directors of the Company selected by the Company and
reasonably acceptable to Allegiance.



ARTICLE VII.

MUTUAL COVENANTS OF ALLEGIANCE 
AND THE COMPANY

Section 7.1 Notification; Updated Disclosure Schedules.

(a) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Allegiance, and Allegiance
shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or
warranty made by it in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect (without regard to any materiality qualifier contained
therein), including as a result of any change in a Schedule, or (ii) the
failure by it to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and provided further,
however, that if such notification under clause (i) relates to any matter
which arises for the first time after the date of this Agreement, then the

condition set forth in Section 10.1(c), with respect to the Company, and in
Section 10.2(c), with respect to Allegiance, incapable of being satisfied.

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Allegiance with supplemental Disclosure Schedules and Allegiance
shall provide the Company with an updated Allegiance Disclosure Letter
reflecting any material changes to the Disclosure Schedules and the Allegiance
Disclosure Letter, respectively, between the date of this Agreement and the
date thereof. Delivery of such supplemental Disclosure Schedules and updated
Allegiance Disclosure Letter shall not cure a breach or modify a
representation or warranty of this Agreement.

Section 7.2 Confidentiality. Allegiance and the Company agree that terms of
the Confidentiality provisions of the Letter of Intent dated March 16, 2018
between Allegiance and the Company (the "Letter of Intent") are incorporated

affiliates, officers, directors, employees and representatives as if parties
thereto, in accordance with the terms thereof.

Section 7.3 Publicity. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or
securities exchange rules or in connection with the regulatory application

concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

effective prior to the Closing Date, except that the winding up of any such
plan may be completed following the Closing Date.

Section 7.5 Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Each of the Company and Allegiance shall take any actions required to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, including by reporting consistently for all U.S. federal,
state, and local income Tax or other purposes. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, none of the Company or Allegiance shall take any action, or
fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

(b) Allegiance shall deliver to Bracewell LLP and Fenimore Kay Harrison and
Ford, LLP an officer's certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, and signed

Kay Harrison and Ford, LLP to render the opinions described in Section 10.3(c),
on the Closing Date (an "Allegiance Tax Representation Letter"). Allegiance

untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
Allegiance Tax Representation Letter.

(c) The Company shall deliver to Bracewell LLP and Fenimore Kay Harrison and
Ford, LLP an officer's certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, and signed
by an officer of the Company, containing representations of the Company as
shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable Bracewell LLP and
Fenimore Kay Harrison and Ford, LLP to render the opinions described in Section
10.3(c) on the Closing Date, (a "Company Tax Representation Letter"). The
Company shall not take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be
untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action that would cause
to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
Company Tax Representation Letter.

(d) Without limiting the provisions of this Section 7.5, the Company and
Allegiance shall comply with the recordkeeping and information reporting
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3.

ARTICLE IX.

TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby may be abandoned by action of
the board of directors of Allegiance or the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time if:

(i) any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
Governmental Body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and non-appealable;

(ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are disapproved
(or the applications or notices for which are suggested or recommended to be
withdrawn) by any Governmental Body or other Person whose approval is required
to consummate any of such transactions;

(iii) the Effective Time has not occurred on or before the one hundred
eightieth (180th) day following the date of this Agreement, unless one or more
of the Regulatory Approvals has not been received on or before the 180th day
after the date of this Agreement, in which case the Effective Time has not
occurred on or before the two hundred tenth (210th) day following the date of
this Agreement, or such later date as has been approved in writing by the
boards of directors of Allegiance and the Company; but the right to terminate
under this Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before such applicable date; 

(iv) the Allegiance Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by
reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Allegiance
Shareholder Meeting; or

(v) the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time
by action of the board of directors of the Company if Allegiance shall fail to
comply in any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of
Allegiance contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect. If
the board of directors of the Company desires to terminate this Agreement
because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as provided in this Section 9.1(b),
the board of directors must notify Allegiance in writing of its intent to
terminate stating the reason therefor. Allegiance shall have fifteen (15) days
from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach or inaccuracy, if
the breach or inaccuracy is capable of being cured.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time
by action of the board of directors of Allegiance if (i) the Company fails to
comply in any material respect with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties of
the Company contained herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect, (ii)
any approval required to be obtained from any regulatory authority or agency
is obtained subject to restrictions or conditions on the operations of the
Company, the Bank, Allegiance or Allegiance Bank that, in the reasonable
judgment of Allegiance, materially and adversely impairs the value of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to Allegiance, that materially
and adversely impairs the economic or business benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Allegiance or otherwise would, in the
reasonable judgment of Allegiance, be so burdensome as to render inadvisable
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)
any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.12(d) shall have occurred. In the
event the board of directors of Allegiance desires to terminate this Agreement
because of an alleged breach or inaccuracy as provided in Section 9.1(c)(i),
the board of directors must notify the Company in writing of its intent to
terminate stating the reason therefor. The Company shall have fifteen (15)
days from the receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach or inaccuracy,
if the breach or inaccuracy is capable of being cured.

(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time
upon the mutual written consent of Allegiance and the Company and the approval
of such action by their respective boards of directors.

(e) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Company
Shareholder Approval by the board of directors of the Company if before such
time, the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and
the board of directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Company's outside legal
counsel), that (i) such Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant to its
terms and after giving effect to the payment of the Termination Fee (as
defined herein) is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to terminate this
Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal 

would cause or would be reasonably likely to cause it to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; provided, however, that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) unless:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Allegiance at least five
(5) Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") of taking such action,
which notice shall advise Allegiance that the board of directors of the
Company has received a Superior Proposal and specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or
"Group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act)
making the Superior Proposal); and

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company shall have, and shall have caused
the Financial Advisor and the Company's outside counsel to, negotiate with
Allegiance in good faith (to the extent Allegiance desires to so negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and the board
of directors of the Company shall have considered such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement resulting from such negotiations and
concluded in good faith based upon consultations with the Financial Advisor
and the advice of the Company's outside legal counsel that such Superior
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal even after giving effect to the
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by
Allegiance.

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal
and the board of directors of the Company in its good faith judgment
determines such revisions are material, the Company shall deliver a new
written notice to Allegiance and shall comply with the requirements of this
Section 9.1(e) with respect to such new written notice, except that the new
Notice Period shall be three (3) Business Days. Termination under this Section
9.1(e) shall not be deemed effective until payment of the Termination Fee as
required by Section 9.3.

(f) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by the
board of directors of Allegiance if (i) the Company has breached the covenant
contained in Section 5.5 in a manner adverse to Allegiance; (ii) the board of
directors of the Company resolves to accept a Superior Proposal; or (iii) the
board of directors of the Company effects a Change in Recommendation.

(g) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing by the
Company, if:

(i) the Average Closing Price is less than $32.52; and

(ii) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by $40.65 is
less than the number obtained by dividing (A) the Final Index Price (as
defined below) by (B) the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and
subtracting 0.20 from such quotient; provided, however, that a termination by
the Company pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) will have no force and effect if
Allegiance agrees in writing (within two (2) Business Days after receipt of
the Company's written notice of such termination) to increase the number of
shares of Allegiance Common Stock in the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as
may be adjusted 

pursuant to Section 2.3(a)) such that the Aggregate Merger Consideration is
equal to $278,564,572 (valuing the Aggregate Stock Consideration based on the
Average Closing Price). If within such two (2)-Business Day period, Allegiance
delivers written notice to the Company that Allegiance intends to proceed with
the Merger by paying such additional consideration as contemplated by the
preceding sentence, and notifies the Company in writing of the revised
Aggregate Merger Consideration, then no termination will occur pursuant to
this Section 9.1(g), and this Agreement will remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms (except that the Aggregate Merger Consideration
will be modified in accordance with this Section 9.1(g)).

(iii) For purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the following terms will have the
meanings indicated below:

(i) "Final Index Price" means the average of the daily closing value of the
Index for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on and including the
fifth trading day preceding the Closing Date.

(ii) "Index" means the financial institutions with the following trading
symbols on an equal weighted basis: CBTX, FFIN, GNBC, GNTY, IBTX, IBOC, LTXB,
PB, SBSI and VBTX.

(iii) "Initial Index Price" means the closing value of the Index on the date
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. Except as provided in Section 9.3, if this
Agreement is terminated by either Allegiance or the Company as provided in
Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or shareholders,
except that the provisions of Section 5.12, Section 7.2, this Section 9.2 and
Section 11.5 shall survive termination of this Agreement. Nothing contained in
this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party hereto of any liability for a breach
of this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Termination Fee and Expenses. To compensate Allegiance for
entering into this Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto
and other losses and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other
opportunities by Allegiance, the Company and Allegiance agree as follows:

(a) Provided that Allegiance is not in material breach of any covenant or
obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured within
fifteen (15) days following receipt of written notice thereof by the Company
specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), if this
Agreement is terminated by:

(i) the Company under the provisions of Section 9.1(e), then the Company shall
pay to Allegiance the sum of $14,272,000 (the "Termination Fee");

(ii) Allegiance under the provisions of Section 9.1(f), then the Company shall
pay to Allegiance the Termination Fee; or 

(iii) either Allegiance or the Company under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at the time of termination, the Registration Statement has
been declared effective for at least twenty-five (25) Business Days prior to
such termination and the Company shall have failed to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting in accordance with Section
5.1, or (B) Section 9.1(a)(v), if, at the time of termination, there exists an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, then the Company shall pay
to Allegiance an amount in immediately available funds equal to the out-of-
pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to Allegiance) incurred by
Allegiance in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement ("Allegiance
Expenses"); provided, however, that the Company's reimbursement obligation
hereunder shall not exceed $775,000 in the aggregate; or

(iv) either Allegiance or the Company under the provisions of (A) Section
9.1(a)(iii), if at such time the Company Shareholder Approval has not
occurred, or (B) Section 9.1(a)(v), if, at the time of termination, there
exists an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and, with respect
to either clause (A) or (B), within twelve (12) months of the termination of
this Agreement, the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to
Allegiance the Termination Fee in immediately available funds, which shall be
net of the Allegiance Expenses previously paid to Allegiance by the Company
pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iii).

(b) The payment of the Termination Fee and/or the Allegiance Expenses shall be
Allegiance's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to termination of this
Agreement as set forth in this Section 9.3. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Termination Fee under the circumstances described in this
Section 9.3 be payable on more than one occasion.

(c) Any payment required by this Section 9.3 shall become payable within two
(2) Business Days after receipt by the non-terminating party of written notice
of termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that if the payment of
the Termination Fee is required pursuant to Section 9.3(a)(iii), then such
payment shall become payable on or before the second (2nd) Business Day
following the execution by the Company of an Acquisition Agreement.

District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), and each
of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such
court in any such Proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of
such Proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and
agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to the matters
contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each party acknowledges and
agrees that the provisions of this Section 11.7 constitute a voluntary and
bargained for agreement between the parties. Process in any Proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world.

Section 11.8 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

Section 11.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal
and enforceable provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the
original purposes and intents of this Agreement.

Section 11.10 Entire Agreement. Except for the confidential provisions of the
Letter of Intent, this Agreement and the exhibits and attachments hereto
represent the entire agreement 

between the parties respecting the transactions contemplated hereby, and all
understandings and agreements heretofore made between the parties hereto are
merged in this Agreement, including the exhibits and schedules delivered
pursuant hereto, which (together with any agreements executed by the parties
hereto contemporaneously with or, if contemplated hereby, subsequent to the
execution of this Agreement) shall be the sole expression of the agreement of
the parties respecting the Merger. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges
that, in executing and delivering this Agreement, it has relied only on the
written representations, warranties and promises of the other parties hereto
that are contained herein or in the other agreements executed by the parties
contemporaneously with or, if contemplated hereby, subsequent to the execution
of this Agreement, and has not relied on the oral statements of any other
party or its representatives.

Section 11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than
one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic
mail (including .pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S.
federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or other transmission
method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and
validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes.

Section 11.12 Assignment; Binding on Successors. Except as otherwise provided
herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit
of, the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, trustees,
administrators, guardians, successors and permitted assigns, but shall not be
assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties.

Section 11.13 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing contained in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any persons, other
than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations, or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

VOTING AGREEMENT

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (the "Voting Agreement"), dated as of April 30, 2018, is
executed by and among Allegiance Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation
("Allegiance"), Post Oak Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation (the
"Company"), and the other persons who are signatories hereto (referred to
herein individually as a "Shareholder" and collectively as the
"Shareholders").

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Allegiance and the Company are entering into
that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as such agreement may be
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Reorganization Agreement"),
pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into Allegiance, with
Allegiance as the surviving entity (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Reorganization Agreement provides that all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
("Company Stock") (other than any Dissenting Shares or Treasury Shares, each
as defined in the Reorganization Agreement) will be exchanged for such
consideration as set forth in the Reorganization Agreement;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Allegiance's willingness to enter
into the Reorganization Agreement, each member of the board of directors and
certain officers of the Company and Post Oak Bank, N.A., a national banking
association and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Bank"), in each
case as set forth following their name on the Shareholder signature page
hereto, have agreed to vote his or her shares of Company Stock in favor of
approval of the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby; and

WHEREAS, the Company and Allegiance are relying on this Voting Agreement in
incurring expenses in reviewing the Company's business, in preparing a proxy
statement/prospectus, in proceeding with the filing of applications for
regulatory approvals and in undertaking other actions necessary for the
consummation of the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the substantial expenses that Allegiance
will incur in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement and to induce Allegiance to execute the
Reorganization Agreement and to proceed to incur such expenses, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby, severally and not jointly, agree as
follows:

1.Each of the Shareholders hereby severally, but not jointly, represents and
warrants to Allegiance and the Company that such Shareholder is the registered
owner or beneficial owner of, or has full voting power with respect to, the
number of shares of Company Stock set forth below such Shareholder's name on
the Shareholder signature page to this Voting Agreement (the "Shares"). While
this Voting Agreement is in effect, each Shareholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, (a) sell or otherwise dispose of or encumber prior to the record
date of the Company's special meeting of shareholders referred to in Section
5.1(a) of the Reorganization Agreement (the "Company Shareholder Meeting") any
or all of his or her Shares or (b) deposit any shares of Company Stock into a
voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to
any shares of Company Stock or grant any proxy with respect thereto, other
than to other members of the board of directors of the Company for the purpose
of voting to approve the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby; provided, however, that the following 

transfers shall be permitted: (w) transfers to any member of the Shareholder's
family, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms
of this Voting Agreement, (x) transfers for estate and tax planning purposes,
including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject
to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Voting
Agreement, (y) transfers to any other shareholder of the Company who has
executed a copy of this Voting Agreement on the date hereof, and (z) such
transfers as Allegiance may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any
transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 1
shall be null and void.

2. Each Shareholder hereby agrees during the term of this Voting Agreement to vote the Shares, and any additional shares of Company Stock or other voting securities of the Company acquired by such Shareholder after the date hereof, (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Reorganization Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby at the Company Shareholder Meeting and (b) against approval of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement) made in opposition to or competition with such proposals (an "Opposing Proposal") presented at the Company Shareholder Meeting or any other meeting of shareholders held prior or subsequent to the Company Shareholder Meeting. If there has been a modification or amendment to the Reorganization Agreement that reduces the Aggregate Merger Consideration (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement), other than any adjustment to the Aggregate Merger Consideration provided for in the Reorganization Agreement, then this Section 2 shall be inapplicable.

3. Each Shareholder shall not invite or seek any Opposing Proposal, support (or publicly suggest that anyone else should support) any Opposing Proposal that may be made, or ask the board of directors of the Company to consider, support or seek any Opposing Proposal or otherwise take any action designed to make any Opposing Proposal more likely. None of the Shareholders shall meet or otherwise communicate with any Person (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement) that makes or is considering making an Opposing Proposal or any representative of such Person after becoming aware that the Person has made or is considering making an Opposing Proposal. Each Shareholder shall promptly advise the Company of each contact the Shareholder or any of the Shareholder's representatives may receive from any Person relating to any Opposing Proposal or otherwise indicating that any Person may wish to participate or engage in any transaction arising out of any Opposing Proposal and will provide the Company with all information Allegiance reasonably requests that is available to the Shareholder regarding any such Opposing Proposal or possible Opposing Proposal. Each Shareholder will not make any claim or join in any litigation alleging that the board of directors of the Company is required to consider, endorse or support any Opposing Proposal or to invite or seek any Opposing Proposal. Each Shareholder shall not take any other action that is reasonably likely to make consummation of the Merger less likely or to impair Allegiance's ability to exercise any of the rights granted by the Reorganization Agreement. 

4. Each Shareholder acknowledges that Allegiance and the Company are relying on this Voting Agreement in preparing a proxy statement/prospectus, in proceeding with the filing of applications for regulatory approvals and in undertaking other actions necessary for the consummation of the Merger. Each Shareholder and the Company acknowledge that the performance of this Voting Agreement is intended to benefit Allegiance. 

5. This Voting Agreement shall continue in effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the termination of the Reorganization Agreement in accordance with its terms or (b) the consummation of the Merger.

6. Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall be deemed to restrict any of the Shareholders from taking any action in the capacity of a director or officer (if applicable) of the Company that such Shareholder shall believe is necessary to fulfill the Shareholder's duties and obligations as a director or officer (if applicable). Each Shareholder is executing this Voting Agreement solely in the Shareholder's capacity as a shareholder of the Company.

7. Each Shareholder has the legal capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform all of the Shareholder's obligations under this Voting Agreement. This Voting Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms except as the enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors rights. If the Shareholder is married and his or her Shares constitute community property, this Voting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of, such Shareholder's spouse, enforceable against such spouse in accordance with its terms.

8. Each Shareholder hereby (a) confirms his knowledge of the availability of the rights of dissenting shareholders under the Texas Business Organizations Code ("TBOC") with respect to the Merger and (b) confirms receipt of a copy of the provisions of the TBOC related to the rights of dissenting shareholders attached hereto as Annex A. Each Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to assert, and shall use its best efforts to cause any of its Affiliates (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement) who hold of record any of the Shareholder's Shares to waive and not to assert, any appraisal rights with respect to the Merger that the Shareholder or such Affiliate may now or hereafter have with respect to any Shares (or any other shares of capital stock of the Company that the Shareholder shall hold of record at the time that Shareholder may be entitled to assert appraisal rights with respect to the Merger) whether pursuant to the TBOC or otherwise.

9. This Voting Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented with respect to a particular Shareholder except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the Company, Allegiance and the Shareholder.

10. This Voting Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

11. This Voting Agreement, together with the Reorganization Agreement and the agreements contemplated thereby, embody the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect to the subject matter contained herein. This Voting Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter contained herein.

12. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereby shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered by hand or mail, certified or registered mail (return receipt requested) with postage prepaid to the addresses of the 

parties hereto set forth below their signature on the signature pages hereof
or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the others in
writing in accordance herewith.

13. Each Shareholder recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by the Shareholder of any covenants or agreements contained in this Voting Agreement will cause Allegiance to sustain damages for which they would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and therefore the parties hereto agree that, in the event of any such breach, Allegiance shall be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable relief, without the necessity of posting bond or proving actual damages, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

14. From time to time, at Allegiance's request and without further consideration, each Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents reasonably requested by Allegiance as may be necessary or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Voting Agreement.

15. This Voting Agreement and the relations among the parties hereto arising from this Voting Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT



THIS DIRECTOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 30, 2018
(the "Execution Date"), is made and entered into by and among, Allegiance
Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation ("Allegiance"), Post Oak Bancshares,
Inc., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), and _____________________, an
individual residing in the State of Texas (the "Undersigned").

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution of this Agreement, Allegiance and
the Company are entering into that certain Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof (as such agreement may be amended
or supplemented from time to time, the "Reorganization Agreement"), pursuant
to which, among other things, the Company will merge with and into Allegiance,
with Allegiance continuing as the surviving entity (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the term "Company" as used in this Agreement with respect to time
periods after the day and time the Merger is completed pursuant to the terms
of the Reorganization Agreement (the "Effective Time") shall mean Allegiance,
as successor to the Company in the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Undersigned is a director of the Company and/or Post Oak Bank,
N.A., a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Bank"), which, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement, will, among other things, merge with Allegiance
Bank, a Texas banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Allegiance
("Allegiance Bank");

WHEREAS, the Undersigned, as a director of the Company and/or the Bank, as the
case may be, has had access to certain Confidential Information (as defined
below), including, without limitation, information concerning the Company's
and the Bank's business and the relationships between the Company and the
Bank, their respective subsidiaries, vendors, and customers, and the Company's
and/or the Bank's status and relationship with peer institutions that compete
with the Bank, the Company, and/or Allegiance Bank, and has had access to
trade secrets, customer goodwill and proprietary information of the Company
and/or the Bank and their respective businesses that constitute a substantial
asset to be acquired by Allegiance;

WHEREAS, the Undersigned recognizes that Allegiance's willingness to enter
into the Reorganization Agreement is dependent on the Undersigned entering
into this Agreement (including the anti-piracy/non-solicitation/non-
competition covenants below) and therefore this Agreement is incident thereto;
and

WHEREAS, any capitalized term not defined herein shall have the meaning set
forth in the Reorganization Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, for the new Confidential Information the Undersigned will be
provided and for other good and valuable consideration contained herein and in
the Reorganization Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

1. Director Support. The Undersigned agrees to use his or her best efforts to refrain from harming the goodwill of Allegiance, the Company, the Bank, Allegiance Bank and their respective subsidiaries, and their respective customer and client relationships during the term of this Agreement.

2. Non-Disclosure Obligations. The Undersigned agrees that he or she will not make any unauthorized disclosure, directly or indirectly, of any Confidential Information of Allegiance, the Company, the Bank or Allegiance Bank to third parties, or make any use thereof, directly or indirectly. The Undersigned also agrees that he or she shall deliver promptly to the Company or Allegiance at any time at its reasonable request, without retaining any copies, all documents and other material in the Undersigned's possession at that time relating, directly or indirectly, to any Confidential Information or other information of Allegiance, Allegiance Bank, the Company or the Bank, or Confidential Information or other information regarding third parties, learned in such person's position as a director, officer or shareholder of the Company or the Bank.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means and includes
Allegiance's, the Company's, Allegiance Bank's and the Bank's confidential
and/or proprietary information and/or trade secrets, including those of their
respective subsidiaries, that have been and/or will be developed or used and
that cannot be obtained readily by third parties from outside sources.
Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the: information
regarding past, current and prospective customers and investors and business
affiliates, employees, contractors, and the industry not generally known to
the public; strategies, methods, books, records, and documents; technical
information concerning products, equipment, services, and processes;
procurement procedures, pricing, and pricing techniques, including contact
names, services provided, pricing, type and amount of services used; financial
data; pricing strategies and price curves; positions; plans or strategies for
expansion or acquisitions; budgets; research; financial and sales data;
trading methodologies and terms; communications information; evaluations,
opinions and interpretations of information and data; marketing and
merchandising techniques; electronic databases; models and the output from
same; specifications; computer programs; contracts; bids or proposals;
technologies and methods; training methods and processes; organizational
structure; personnel information, including compensation and bonuses; payments
or rates paid to consultants or other service providers; other such
confidential or proprietary information; and notes, analysis, compilations,
studies, summaries, and other material prepared by or for Allegiance, the
Company, Allegiance Bank, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries
containing or based, in whole or in part, on any information included in any
of the foregoing. The term "Confidential Information" does not include any
information that (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally
available to and known to the public, other than by a breach of this Agreement
by the disclosing party; (ii) was available to the disclosing party, prior to
disclosure by Allegiance, the Company, Allegiance Bank or the Bank, on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Undersigned and is not known
by the Undersigned, after reasonable investigation, to be subject to any
fiduciary, contractual or legal obligations of confidentiality; or (iii) was
independently acquired or developed by the Undersigned without violating any
obligations of this Agreement. The Undersigned acknowledges that Allegiance's,
the Company's, Allegiance Bank's and the Bank's respective businesses are
highly competitive, that this Confidential Information constitutes valuable,
special and unique assets to be acquired by Allegiance in the Merger and
constitutes existing valuable, special, and unique assets held by the Company
pre-Merger, and that protection of such Confidential Information against
unauthorized disclosure and use is of critical importance to Allegiance. 

3. Non-Competition Obligations. The Undersigned agrees that, for the period beginning on the Execution Date and continuing until the date that is three (3) years after the Effective Time of the Merger (the "Non-Competition Period"), the Undersigned will not, except as a director or officer of the Company or the Bank prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, in any capacity, directly or indirectly:

| 
---|--- 

a)

|

compete or engage, anywhere in the geographic area comprised of the fifty (50)
mile radius surrounding the locations of the Bank or Allegiance Bank banking
centers that were formerly locations of the Bank at the Effective Time (the
"Market Area"), in a business as a federally insured depository institution; 

| 
---|--- 

b)

|

take any action to invest in, own, manage, operate, control, participate in,
be employed or engaged by, be a director of, or otherwise be connected in any
manner with any individual, corporation (including any non-profit
corporation), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, or governmental body (each
a "Person") engaging in a business similar to that of Allegiance, Allegiance
Bank, the Company or the Bank anywhere within the Market Area. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Undersigned is permitted hereunder to own, directly or
indirectly, up to one percent (1%) of the issued and outstanding securities of
any publicly traded financial institution conducting business in the Market
Area; 

| 
---|--- 

c)

|

(i) call on, service or solicit competing business from customers of
Allegiance, Allegiance Bank, the Company or the Bank or any of their
respective affiliates if, within the twelve (12) months before the date of
this Agreement, the Undersigned had or made contact with the customer, or had
access to information and files about the customer or (ii) interfere with or
damage (or attempt to interfere with or damage) any relationship between
Allegiance, the Company or the Bank or any of their respective affiliates and
any such customer; or 

| 
---|--- 

d)

|

call on, solicit or induce any employee of Allegiance, Allegiance Bank, the
Company or the Bank or any of their respective affiliates whom the Undersigned
had contact with, knowledge of, or association with in the course of service
with the Company or the Bank (whether as an employee or a contractor) to
terminate his or her employment from or contract with Allegiance, Allegiance
Bank, the Company or the Bank or any of their respective affiliates, and will
not assist any other Person in such activities. 

4. Non-Competition Covenant Reasonable. The Undersigned acknowledges that the restrictions imposed by this Agreement are legitimate, reasonable and necessary to protect Allegiance's acquisition of the Company and the goodwill thereof. The Undersigned acknowledges that the scope and duration of the restrictions contained herein are reasonable in light of the time that the Undersigned has been engaged in the business of the Company and/or the Bank and the Undersigned's relationship with the customers of the Company and/or the Bank. The Undersigned further acknowledges that the restrictions contained herein are not burdensome to the Undersigned in light of the other opportunities that remain open to the Undersigned. Moreover, the Undersigned 

acknowledges that he or she has and will have other means available to him or
her for the pursuit of his or her livelihood after the Effective Time of the
Merger.

5. Consideration. In consideration for the above obligations of the Undersigned, in addition to those matters set forth in the Recitals to this Agreement, the Company agrees to provide the Undersigned with access to new Confidential Information relating to the Company's business, which will become Allegiance's business after the Effective Time of the Merger, in a greater quantity and/or expanded nature than that already provided to the Undersigned. The Undersigned also will have access to, or knowledge of, new Confidential Information of third parties, such as actual and potential customers, suppliers, partners, joint venturers, investors, financing sources, etc., of the Company and/or the Bank prior to the Merger and of Allegiance after the Effective Time of the Merger. 

6. Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedies. The Undersigned acknowledges that the injury that would be suffered by Allegiance or the Company as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Section 3) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages to Allegiance or the Company, as the case may be, for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, each of Allegiance and the Company will have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to seek specific performance, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any proposed or actual breach or threatened breach or otherwise to specifically enforce any provision of this Agreement without the obligation to post bond or other security in seeking such relief. Such equitable remedies are in addition to the right to obtain compensatory and punitive damages, and attorney's fees, and, notwithstanding Allegiance's or the Company's, as the case may be, right to so seek damages, the Undersigned waives any defense that an adequate remedy for Allegiance or the Company, as the case may be, exists under law. If the Undersigned, on the one hand, or Allegiance or the Company, on the other hand, must bring suit to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and costs related thereto.

7. Extension of Restrictive Covenant Period. In the event that the Company or Allegiance shall file a lawsuit in any court of competent jurisdiction alleging a breach of Section 3 of this Agreement by the Undersigned and the Company or Allegiance is successful on the merits of such lawsuit, then any time period set forth in this Agreement including the time periods set forth in Section 3, will be extended one month for each month the Undersigned was in breach of this Agreement, so that the Company or Allegiance is provided the benefit of the full Non-Competition Period.

8. Effectiveness of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective on the Execution Date. This Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect if (a) the Reorganization Agreement is not executed on or prior to the Execution Date, or (b) the Reorganization Agreement (once executed) is terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger does not occur.

9. Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To 

the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising
out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by
a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the
other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or
demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, Allegiance and their respective successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any successor by merger, consolidation or stock purchase of the Company, Allegiance and any Person that acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or Allegiance.

11. Notices. All notices, consents, waiver, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by electronic mail, provided, that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt requested, or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate addresses and electronic mail addresses set forth below (or to such other address or to such other Person as any party hereto has last designated by notice to the other parties in accordance herewith):

14. Jurisdiction. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement may be brought against either of the parties in the courts of the State of Texas, County of Harris, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in a United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas located in Houston, Texas, and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on either party anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing a party may commence any action or proceeding in a court other than the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

15. Section Headings, Construction. The headings of Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to "Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number, as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms.

16. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. If any restriction in this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the restrictions be reformed by such court in such a manner that protects the business and Confidential Information of Allegiance, the Company, Allegiance Bank and the Bank to the maximum extent permissible.

17. Representation by Counsel; Interpretation. Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to be represented by counsel in the negotiation, preparation, and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law, including, but not limited to, the doctrine of contra proferentem, or any legal decision which would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived. The provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a reasonable manner to effect the intent of the parties.

18. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
