\- 40 - (b) _Assignment_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract,
permit, or license or any claim or right or any benefit or obligation
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an assignment thereof, without the
consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or violation
thereof and if such a consent is not obtained at or prior to the Closing.

(ii) If there are any consents or approvals required to be obtained to assign
any Contract, permit, or license or any claim or right or any benefit or
obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom other than the Material Consents
(the " _Other Consents_ ") that have not yet been obtained (or otherwise
are not in full force and effect) as of the Closing, the applicable Seller
will continue to use its reasonable efforts to obtain the Other Consents.
Prior to the obtaining of such Other Consents, the parties shall cooperate
with each other in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide
to Buyer the benefits of use of any and all Contracts, permits or licenses to
which such Other Consents relate for their respective terms (or any right or
benefit arising thereunder, including the enforcement for the benefit of
Buyer of any and all rights of the applicable Seller against a third party
thereunder). To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits pursuant to
this _Section 6(b)(ii)_ of any Assigned Contract, permit or license, Buyer
shall perform for the benefit of the other Persons that are party thereto the
obligations of the applicable Seller thereunder and pay, discharge and satisfy
any related liabilities that, but for the lack of an authorization, approval,
consent or waiver to assign such liabilities to Buyer, would be Assumed
Liabilities. When consent for the sale, assignment, assumption, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of an Assigned Contract, permit or license is
obtained, the applicable Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and
deliver such Assigned Contract, permit or license to Buyer, and Buyer shall
assume the obligations under such Assigned Contract, permit or license from
and after the date of assignment pursuant to a special-purpose assignment and
assumption agreement substantially similar in terms to those of the Assignment
and Assumption Agreement, as applicable (which special-purpose agreement the
parties shall prepare, execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such
transfer, all at no additional cost to Buyer).

(c) _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving the Target Business, each of the other Parties will take
reasonable actions to cooperate with him, her, or it and his, her, or its
counsel in the contest or defense, make available his, her, or its personnel,
and provide such testimony and access to his, her, or its books, records and
other items and materials as shall be necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under _Section 8_). 

(d) _Transition._ Neither Sellers nor Remy will take, nor shall Sellers permit
any Subsidiary to take, any action that is designed or intended to have the
effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, or other
business associate of Sellers or any of the Subsidiaries from maintaining the
same business relationships with the Target Business after the Closing as
it maintained with the Target Business prior to the closing.

(e) _Confidentiality_. Sellers and Remy will treat and hold as such all
of the Confidential Information, refrain from using any of the Confidential

Buyer or destroy, at the request and option of Buyer, all tangible

Sellers or Remys possession. In the event that Sellers or Remy
are requested or required pursuant to written or oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential
Information, Sellers or Remy will notify Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6(e)_. If, in the absence of
a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Sellers or Remy are,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information
to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, Sellers or Remy may
disclose the Confidential Information to the tribunal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sellers or Remy shall use their best efforts to obtain, at
the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed as Buyer shall designate. The foregoing provisions shall not
apply to any Confidential Information that is generally available to the
public immediately prior to the time of disclosure unless such Confidential
Information is so available due to the actions of Sellers or Remy.

(f) _Covenant Not to Compete_. For a period of five (5) years from and
after the Closing Date, neither Remy, Sellers nor any of their respective
Affiliates will directly or indirectly engage in, or own any ownership
interest in, any business which engages or plans to engage in any business
substantially similar to the Target Business; _provided_ , _however __,_ that
ownership of less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any
publicly traded corporation shall not be restricted by this _Section 6(f)_.
If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any
term or provision of this _Section 6(f)_ is invalid or unenforceable, the
Parties agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention
of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

(g) _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

(i) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall offer employment to substantially all
employees of Sellers and the Subsidiaries. Each employee of Sellers that is
offered employment shall be offered such employment on terms and conditions
(including employee benefits) that will be communicated by the Buyer at its

Buyer will agree to consider for employment, subject to standard Buyer
employment checks, employees not actively at work at the date of Closing.

(ii) Except as described in the next sentence of this _Section 6(g)(ii)_, the
employment of each Transferred Employee with Sellers shall be terminated, and
the employment of each such Transferred Employee with Buyer shall commence,
immediately upon the Closing. In the case of any employee who is absent from
active employment as of the date of the Closing due to an approved leave of
absence, the employment of such individual shall remain with Seller post-
Closing until the date of his or her return to active work from approved leave
of absence, and such employee shall then be eligible for an offer of
employment with Buyer, who if offered and accepts such employment, shall
become a Transferred Employee as of such date.

(iii) Sellers shall pay the Transferred Employees within ten (10) calendar
days after the Closing (and sooner if required under its policies or

Closing Date and Sellers shall timely discharge the liability for payroll
Taxes related thereto.



 

\- 42 - (iv) Buyer shall assume the Liability for employee bonuses (including
retention bonuses for each Transferred Employee as set out on _Section
6(g)(iv)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) earned in 2006 but which are payable in
2007. Sellers shall retain and honor all other bonus or incentive plans and
all employment, severance, termination and retirement agreements to which any
of Sellers or Subsidiaries is a party, as such agreements are in effect on the
date hereof. _Section 6(g)(iv)_ of the Disclosure Schedule provides: (1) a
full listing of Transferred Employees qualified for retention bonuses and the
amounts of those bonuses; and (2) the formula used in determining employee
bonuses for 2006 and an estimate of the total employee bonus amount for 2006.

(v) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan in which any Transferred
Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date
(the " _Buyer Plans_ "), Buyer will recognize service of Transferred Employees
(or otherwise credited by the Target Business) accrued on or prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate provided, however,
that in no event will any credit be given to the extent it would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(vi) With respect to Transferred Employees who are participants in Remys
401(k) Savings Plan ("Sellers 401(k) Plan") immediately prior to the Closing,
(i) Buyers tax-qualified Code Section 401(k) plan (" _Buyer s 401(k)
Plan_") shall accept "eligible roll-over distributions" (within the meaning of
Code Section 402(c)(4)) from Sellers 401(k) Plan and, (ii) with respect to
each Transferred Employee who elects an eligible roll-over distribution to
the Buyers 401(k) plan and who has an outstanding plan loan under the terms
and conditions of the Sellers 401(k) Plan, Buyers 401(k) Plan shall accept a
direct roll-over of the related participant note for a plan loan from the
Buyers 401(k) Plan consistent with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.401(a)(31)-1 (QandA-16).

(vii) Buyer shall assume as an Assumed Liability and be responsible for, and
shall give full credit for, all 2007 vacation benefits of the Transferred
Employees accrued but not taken as of the Closing Date. Sellers shall have no

warranties under _Sections 3(o)_ , and _3(q)_ ), _8(b)(iii)_ and _(iv) _of
this Agreement. Buyer shall provide Sellers with copies of the Transaction
Insurance Policy and the Environmental Insurance Policy as well as any and all
amendments or supplements thereto. In the event of a claim, Buyer shall
provide Sellers with a copy of all correspondence and documents with respect
to the claim. In the event that the Transaction Insurance Company or the
Environmental Insurance Company denies the claim, the Sellers shall remain
obligated to indemnify Buyer with respect to such Losses _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such obligation shall be conditioned upon the Buyers
diligent good faith and commercially reasonable efforts to assert its claim
under the Transaction Insurance Policy or the Environmental Insurance Policy,
respectively, and its exhaustion of all procedures set forth in the
Transaction Insurance Policy or the Environmental Insurance Policy with
respect to appeal of any denial of claim or reservation of rights by the
Transaction Insurance Company or the Environmental Insurance Company,
respectively. The parties shall cooperate in resolving any Loss with respect
to which the Transaction Insurance Company or the Environmental Insurance
Company has denied coverage, including the assignment of rights from the
Buyer to the Sellers upon request.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary,
including  _Sections 8(a)_ , _8(e)(i)_ , _8(e)(ii)_ , and _8(e)(iii)_ ,
nothing herein shall be deemed to limit any Partys rights to recover any or
all Losses incurred or suffered by it relating to or arising out of or in
connection with fraud, it being understood and agreed that the right to
recover such Losses shall survive forever; _provided_ , _however_ , in no
event shall either Buyer or Sellers have any liability for indemnification
under _Section 8_ in excess of the Purchase Price in the aggregate.

(vii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise to the contrary,
Buyer may recover for a Loss related to an Assumed Liability only to the
extent that such Loss results from a breach of a representation or warranty by
Sellers or Remy hereunder, or to the extent such Loss results from the
intentional misrepresentation or fraud of Sellers or Remy.



 

\- 53 - (f) _Matters Involving Third Parties._

(i) If any third party notifies an Indemnified Party with respect to a Third-
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however, that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is thereby prejudiced.

(ii) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days after
the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third-Party Claim (or sooner if
such claim so requires) that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against any and all Losses the Indemnified Party
may suffer arising out of or relating to the Third-Party Claim, (B) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the
financial resources to defend against the Third-Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder, (C) the Third-Party Claim involves only
money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (D)
settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Third-Party Claim
is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to
establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business
interests or the reputation of the Indemnified Party, and (E) the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and
diligently. This provision shall not apply to the extent that the Transaction
Insurance Company or the Environmental Insurance Company elects to defend
the Third Party Claim.

(iii) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the
Third-Party Claim in accordance with _Section 8(f)(ii)_, (A) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party
will not consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld), and (C) the Indemnifying
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(iv) In the event any of the conditions in _Section 8(f)(ii)_ is or becomes
unsatisfied (after notice to the Indemnifying Party and after the
Indemnifying Partys failure to cure such conditions), (A) the Indemnified
Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment on or enter
into any settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it
may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or
obtain any consent from, any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (B)
the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly
and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Claim
(including attorneys fees and expenses), and (C) the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer arising out
of or relating to the Third-Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in
this _Section 8_.

(g) _Limitation of Recourse_. Except in any case involving actual fraud, the
rights of the Parties for indemnification relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly limited to those contained
in _Section 8_ hereof and such indemnification rights shall be the exclusive
remedies of the parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any
matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith.



 

\- 54 - (h) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. To the extent permitted by Law, any amounts
payable under  _Section 8(b)_ or _8(c)_ shall be treated by Buyer and
Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

SECTION 9 TERMINATION 

(a) _Termination of Agreement_. Certain of the Parties may terminate this
Agreement as provided below:

(i) Buyer and Sellers may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent
at any time prior to the Closing;

(ii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Sellers at
any time prior to the Closing:

(A) in the event Sellers have breached any material covenant, representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Buyer has
notified Seller in writing of such breach, and the breach has continued
without cure for a period of fifteen (15) days after notice of such breach
(which agreement of Buyer that the breach has been cured shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld);

(B) in the event Sellers have breached any material representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Sellers have
notified Buyer in writing of such breach by way of providing an Interim
Disclosure, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Interim Disclosure (which agreement
of Buyer that the breach has been cured shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
delayed or withheld);

(C) in the event Sellers have breached any material representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Sellers have

Disclosure, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of five (5)
days after providing the Final Disclosure (which agreement of Buyer that the
breach has been cured shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld); or

(D) at any time on or after April 30, 2007 (the " _Termination Date_ ") if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date, by
reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _Section 7(a)_ (unless
the failure results primarily from Buyer breaching any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement); and

(iii) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Buyer
at any time prior to Closing:

(A ) in the event Buyer has breached any material covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Sellers have

cure for a period of fifteen (15) days after notice of such breach (which
agreement of Sellers that the breach has been cured shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld); or



 

\- 55 - (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Termination Date,
by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under _Section 7(b)_
(unless the failure results primarily from Sellers breaching any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement).

(iv) Buyer or Sellers may terminate this Agreement on or after April 30, 2007,
if the Closing has not occurred for any reason on or before such date. Such
termination may be made by giving written notice to the other party.

(b) _Effect of Termination._ If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9_, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall
terminate without any Liability of any Party (except for any Liability of any
Party then in breach); provided, however, all obligations of the Parties
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its
terms.

SECTION 10 MISCELLANEOUS

(a) _Press Releases and Public Announcements_. No Party shall issue any press
release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party must first provide to the other Parties the content of the
proposed disclosure, after consulting with the other party and its counsel as
to the wording of such disclosure, the reasons that such disclosure is
required, and the time and place that the disclosure will be made). The
disclosing Party will use reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment
for such disclosure.

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties, and to the
extent expressly set forth herein, their Affiliates, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, the Seller Indemnified Parties, and all of their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

(c) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Transaction Agreements, the
Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents referred to herein,
constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

(d) _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Party; provided, however, that Buyer may (i)
assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of
its Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform
its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Buyer nonetheless
shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
hereunder and the guaranty of Sellers Parent contained on the signature page
hereto shall remain in full force and effect).

(e) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be deemed
an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same
instrument. Facsimile transmission of a counterpart hereto shall constitute
an original hereof.



 

\- 56 - (f) _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

_(_ g) _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be

been given (i) when received if given in person or by courier or courier

or such other address as any Party may from time to time specify by notice to
the other Parties. Any Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

(h)  _Applicable Law; Choice of Forum._ This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State
of Illinois, United States of America, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of Law provision or rule (whether the State of Illinois or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Illinois, United States of America. The Parties agree
that any suit, action or proceeding brought by the Parties in connection with
or arising out of this Agreement shall be brought solely in the United States
District Court of the Northern District of Illinois or, if such court lacks
jurisdiction, in the Circuit Court of Peoria County, Illinois. Each Party
consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such court.

(i) _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Buyer and
Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such default, misrepresentation, or breach
of warranty or covenant.

(j) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

(k) _Expenses_. Each of Buyer, the stockholders of Sellers, Sellers, and each
Subsidiary will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the stockholders of Sellers
shall also bear the costs and expenses of Sellers and the Subsidiaries
(including all of their legal fees and expenses) in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. Buyer and Sellers
shall share equally the fee for any filing required under the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Act. Each Party shall be responsible for its own costs related to the
Closing Financial Statements.

(l) _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local,
or foreign statute or Law shall mean such statute or Law, as amended,
codified, replaced, or re-enacted, in whole or in part, and shall also be
deemed to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless
the context requires otherwise. Unless the context requires otherwise,
singular includes plural and vice versa and any gender includes every gender,
and where any word or phrase is given a defined meaning, any other grammatical
form of that word or phrase  



 

\- 58 -  will have a correlative meaning. The word "including" shall mean including
without limitation. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with
particularity and adequately describes the relevant facts. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of
a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception
to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or
warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself).
The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the
fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or
covenant. All references to "$", "dollars" and "Dollars" in this Agreement
shall be references to United States dollars.

(m) _Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

(n) _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise
is breached, so that a Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which such
Party may be entitled, at Law or in equity. In particular, the Parties
acknowledge that the Target Business is unique and recognize and affirm that
in the event Sellers breach this Agreement, money damages would be inadequate
and Buyer would have no adequate remedy at Law, so that Buyer shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to
enforce its rights and the other Parties obligations hereunder not only by
action for damages but also by action for specific performance, injunctive,
and/or other equitable relief. Buyer shall not be required to post bond or any
other security in connection with any action for specific performance,
injunctive, and/or other equitable relief.

(o) _Governing Language_. This Agreement has been negotiated and executed by
the Parties in English. In the event any translation of this Agreement is
prepared for convenience or any other purpose, the provisions of the English
version shall prevail.

(p) _Bulk Sales Laws_. In the event any claim should be asserted against Buyer
relating to the Acquired Assets pursuant to any Bulk Sales Law, Buyer will,
within thirty (30) days receipt of such notice, furnish a copy thereof to
Sellers and tender the defense of such claim to Seller, which shall assume the
defense thereof and shall further indemnify Buyer from liability for any and
all such claims pursuant to _Section 8_ of this Agreement.

(q) _Remittances_. All remittances, payments, mail and other communications
relating to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities received by Sellers
at any time after the Closing Date shall be promptly turned over to Buyer by
Sellers. All remittances, payments, mail and other communications relating
to any asset that is not an Acquired Asset or any liability that is not an
Assumed Liability received by Buyer at any time after the Closing Date shall
be promptly turned over to Sellers by Buyer.
