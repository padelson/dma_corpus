a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

(A) Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a tender offer (as it may
be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_
") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Shares_ "), other than the Excluded Shares and the Converted Shares, for
$48.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (such amount, or
any higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer, and as may be adjusted
in accordance with _Section 1.1(g)_, being the " _Offer Price_ "), and
subject to any withholding of Taxes, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(B) As soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company

Corporation_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby (i) each issued and outstanding Share as of the Effective
Time (other than Excluded Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without
interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes, and (ii) the Company shall
become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

 



 

(C) The board of directors of the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (iii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, (iv) resolved that the Merger shall be effected under Section

conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(D) The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to

(E) Parent, Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that the Merger
shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall, subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be consummated
as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer.

1.1(e)_ and _1.2(b)_ ), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to purchase all of the outstanding Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to _Sections 2.5(a)(i)_ and _2.5(a)(ii)_ (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ "), and other than Shares to be converted pursuant to
_Section 2.5(a)(iii)_ (collectively, the " _Converted Shares_ ")), at a price
per Share equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without
interest, and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section
2.6(e)_.

 



 

(b) **Terms and Conditions of the Offer**. The obligations of Purchaser to,

contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the
Termination Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer

consideration payable in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares
sought to be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, modify or waive the Minimum

_1.1(d)_ or (H) provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension
thereof) within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date (or any
rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 8_.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) **Expiration and Extension of the Offer**. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (determined as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) from the Offer Commencement Date
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the PartiesÂ’
respective termination rights under _Section 8_: (i) if, as of the then-
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or
Parent, Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the
Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for
an additional period of up to ten (10) business days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) any period
required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (B) periods of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act and any foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement shall
have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the scheduled Expiration
Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the
request of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to
ten (10) business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be
required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (x) the valid
termination of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 8_ and (y) the End
Date (such earlier occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ "); or (2) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer, or
permit the Offer to expire, prior to the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company.

 



 

(d) **Termination of Offer**. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be deemed
to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8_. In
the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8_,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately, irrevocably
and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Shares
pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly return,
and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.

 



 

(e) **Offer Documents**. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer
statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") that
will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Purchaser agree that
they shall cause the Offer

 



     

 

 



 

Documents filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements and (y) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Parent and
Purchaser or ParentÂ’s legal counsel all information concerning the Company and
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel.
Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments (including oral comments) Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of those comments (including oral comments).

 



 

(f) **Funds**. Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_, Parent
shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of PurchaserÂ’s obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all of
their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the
Offer.

 



 

(g) **Adjustments**. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section 1.1(g)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) **Acceptance**. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i)
promptly after (and in any event no later than the first business day after)
the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the " _Offer
Acceptance_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Time_ ") and (ii) promptly after (and in any event no later than the second
business day after) the Offer Acceptance Time pay for such Shares.

 



 

 **1.2** **Company Actions**.

 



 

(a) **Schedule 14D-9**. As promptly as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, following the filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall (i) file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, shall reflect the
Company Board Recommendation and include the notice and other information
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and (ii) cause the Schedule 14D-9
and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, including by setting the
Stockholder List Date as the record date for purposes of receiving the notice
required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 (x) to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to the Company or the CompanyÂ’s legal counsel all information
concerning Parent or Purchaser that may be required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.2(a)_. Parent and
its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 (including any response to any comments (including oral
comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any such comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company
agrees to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments (including oral
comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments
(including oral comments).

 



 

(b) **Stockholder Lists**. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a
list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and
the Merger (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the
Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first

 



     

 

 



 

disseminated, which date shall not be more than ten (10) business days prior
to the date the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated,
the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Transactions, Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the
Company, deliver, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
agents to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control, and, if
requested by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all
such material has been returned or destroyed.

 



 

(c) **Share Registry**. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by
Purchaser effective immediately after the Offer Acceptance Time.

any event on the same date as) the Offer Acceptance Time except if the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ shall not be satisfied or, to the
extent permissible by applicable Legal Requirements, waived as of such date,
in which case on the first business day on which all conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ are satisfied or, to the extent permissible by applicable Legal
Requirements, waived, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in

certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
with respect to the Merger, in such form as required by, and executed and
acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the
Parties shall take all such further actions as may be required by applicable
Legal Requirements to make the Merger effective. The Merger shall become
effective upon the date and time of the filing of that certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later date and
time as is agreed upon in writing by the Parties and specified in the
certificate of merger (such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

 **2.4** **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers**.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, be amended and
restated to read in its entirety as set forth on _Annex II_ and, as so amended
and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Legal Requirements, subject to _Section 6.5(a)_.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be

references to the name of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the respective individuals who served as the directors

 **2.5** **Conversion of Shares**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of the
Company:

 



 

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company (or
held in the CompanyÂ’s treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent or
Purchaser shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



 

(iii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Purchaser) or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into such number of shares of
stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary shall own
the same percentage of the outstanding

 



     

 

 



 

capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time;

 



 

(iv) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ above and
subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares, which shall have only those
rights set forth in _Section 2.7_) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in each case without
any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance
with _Section 2.6(e)_; and

 



 

(v) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, subject to this
_Section 2.5(a)_, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section
2.6_.

 



 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.5(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **2.6** **Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the aggregate Offer
Price to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to
_Section 1.1(b)_ and to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders
of Shares to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
such Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_. Promptly after
(and in any event no later than the second business day after) the Offer
Acceptance Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Depository Agent cash sufficient to make the payment of the aggregate
Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (together with the amount deposited pursuant the
immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Offer Price
in the Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration in the Merger. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Surviving
Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be (w) in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, (y) in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or (z) in money market funds having a

 



     

 

 



 

rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if
applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agentÂ’s message in respect to
Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.5_.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if applicable) or Book-
Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in the case of
Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such transfer or other Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. None
of Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability
for the transfer and other similar Taxes described in this _Section 2.6(b)_
under any circumstance. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.6_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (with
respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_) which had been made available to
the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent
in respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled

 



     

 

 



 

to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser, and their
Affiliates (and any other applicable withholding agent, including the Paying
Agent and the Depository Agent), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration, any consideration payable to any
holder of Company Options or Company RSUs or any other consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the
Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Section 2_.

 



 

 **2.7** **Appraisal Rights**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their

 



     

 

 



 

rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer
outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be entitled to only such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holderÂ’s right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, such holderÂ’s Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (less
any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section
2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall
have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to settle, or make
any payment with respect to, any such demands, or agree or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

 



 

 **2.8** **Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised, whether or not vested and which has a per share exercise price
that is less than the Merger Consideration (each, an " _In the Money Option_
"), shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a
cash payment equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration
over (y) the exercise price payable per Share under such In the Money Option,
multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares subject to such In the Money
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to vesting).

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option other than an In the Money
Option that is then outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested, shall
be cancelled with no consideration payable in respect thereof.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company RSU, whether or not
vested, shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)
the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU.

 



 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay the
aggregate consideration payable pursuant to _Sections 2.8(a)_ and _2.8(c)_ ,
net of any applicable withholding Taxes, payable with respect to In the Money
Options and Company RSUs through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving
CorporationÂ’s payroll (subject to any required withholding Taxes) to the
holders of In the Money Options and/or Company RSUs. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any disqualifying disposition with respect to a
Company Option that is an incentive stock option (within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Code) or of any Shares acquired upon the exercise

 



     

 

 



 

thereof shall be subject to Tax reporting and withholding in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
appropriate or necessary (under the Company Equity Plan and award agreements
pursuant to which Company Options and Company RSUs are outstanding or
otherwise) to effect the transactions described in this _Section 2.8_,
including the acceleration of the exercisability of the Company Options, so
that as of, and contingent upon, the Effective Time there are no obligations
in respect of the Company Options and Company RSUs other than the right to
receive the payments under _Sections 2.8(a)_ and _2.8(c)_.

 



 

(f) To the extent a payment pursuant in this _Section 2.8_ would trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made on
the earliest date that payment would not trigger such Tax or penalty.

 



 

 **2.9** **Further Action**. The Parties agree to take all necessary action to
cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with this _Section 2_ as
soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer without a meeting
of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If,
at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably
determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

 



 

 **SECTION 3**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows
(it being understood that each representation and warranty contained in this
_Section 3_ is subject to (a) exceptions and disclosures set forth in the
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the
particular Section or subsection in this _Section 3_; (b) any exception or
disclosure set forth in any other section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to the extent the applicability of such exception or
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face to qualify such other
representation and warranty; and (c) disclosure in the Company SEC Documents
filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (other than
any information in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" sections
of such Company SEC Documents or other general cautionary or forward-looking
statements in any other sections of such Company SEC Documents)):

 



 

 **3.1** **Due Organization; Subsidiaries, Etc**.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the CompanyÂ’s only
Subsidiaries are (i) Yarra Therapeutics, LLC, a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in

 



     

 

 



 

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (ii) Array BioPharma
Ltd., a private limited company, duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of England and Wales, and (iii) Array BioPharma
Limited, a private limited company duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Ireland (the Company and each such Subsidiary,
an " _Acquired Corporation_ " and collectively, the " _Acquired Corporations_
"). Each Acquired Corporation has all necessary power and authority: (i) to
conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being
conducted; and (ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its
assets are currently owned and used. Each Acquired Corporation is qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such qualification
or licensing, except where the failure does not have, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock or ordinary shares of the other Acquired Corporations, free
and clear of all Encumbrances and transfer restrictions, except for
Encumbrances or transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be
provided under the Securities Act or applicable securities laws. Except for
the shares of capital stock or ordinary shares of the other Acquired
Corporations held by the Company, no Acquired Corporation owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or equity interests in, or subscriptions,
options, calls, warrants or rights (whether or not currently exercisable) to
acquire, or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for, any capital stock or equity interests of any Entity.

 



 

 **3.2** **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws**. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational
documents of each Acquired Corporation, including all amendments thereto, as
in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

 **3.3** **Capitalization, Etc**.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i) 340,000,000
Shares, of which 223,095,419 Shares had been issued and were outstanding as of
the close of business on June 13, 2019 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "); and
(ii) 10,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock, of which no shares are
outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares and the outstanding shares of
capital stock or ordinary shares of the other Acquired Corporations have been
duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable. From
the Capitalization Date to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has
not issued any Shares except pursuant to the exercise of the purchase rights
under the Company ESPP, the exercise of Company Options or the settlement of
Company RSUs outstanding as of the Capitalization Date in accordance with
their terms and, since the Capitalization Date, except as permitted by this
Agreement for the period following the date of this Agreement, the Company has
not issued any Company Options or Company RSUs.

 



 

(b) (i) None of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Acquired
Corporations are entitled or subject to any preemptive right, right of
repurchase or forfeiture, right of participation, right of maintenance or any
similar right; (ii) none of the outstanding

 



     

 

 



 

shares of capital stock of the Acquired Corporations are subject to any right
of first refusal in favor of any Acquired Corporation; (iii) there are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of any Acquired
Corporation having a right to vote on any matters on which the stockholders of
the Acquired Corporations have a right to vote; and (iv) there is no Contract
relating to the voting or registration of, or restricting any Person from
purchasing, selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of (or from granting any
option or similar right with respect to), any shares of capital stock of the
Acquired Corporations. No Acquired Corporation is under any obligation, or
bound by any Contract pursuant to which it may become obligated, to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Acquired Corporations. The Shares constitute the only outstanding
class of securities of the Company registered under the Securities Act.

 



 

(c) As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date: (i) 16,008,904
Shares were subject to issuance pursuant to Company Options granted and
outstanding under the Company Equity Plan, (ii) 1,125,625 Shares were subject
to issuance pursuant to Company RSUs granted and outstanding under the Company
Equity Plan, (iii) 37,894,794 Shares were reserved for future issuance under
Company Equity Plan, (iv) 745,032 Shares were reserved for future issuance
under the Company ESPP and (v) 8,155,918 Shares were reserved for future
issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes. As of the close of
business on the Capitalization Date, the weighted average exercise price of
the Company Options outstanding as of that date was $10.66. Other than as set
forth in this _Section 3.3(c)_, there is no issued, reserved for issuance,
outstanding or authorized stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock,
profit participation or similar rights or equity-based awards with respect to
any Acquired Corporation.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.3_ and except for the Convertible
Senior Notes, Company Options and Company RSUs outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement (and Shares issuable upon the conversion or exercise thereof,
as applicable), there are no: (i) outstanding shares of capital stock of or
other securities of any Acquired Corporation; (ii) outstanding subscriptions,
options, calls, warrants or rights (whether or not currently exercisable) to
acquire any shares of the capital stock, restricted stock unit, stock-based
performance unit or any other right that is linked to, or the value of which
is in any way based on or derived from the value of any shares of capital
stock or other securities of any Acquired Corporation, in each case other than
derivative securities not issued by an Acquired Corporation; (iii) outstanding
securities, instruments, bonds, debentures, notes or obligations that are or
may become convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of the capital
stock or other securities of any Acquired Corporation; or (iv) stockholder
rights plans (or similar plans commonly referred to as a "poison pill") or
Contracts under which any Acquired Corporation is or may become obligated to
sell or otherwise issue any shares of its capital stock or any other
securities.

 



 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Convertible Senior Notes is $126,060,000. The "Conversion Rate"
(as defined in the Convertible Senior Notes Indenture) equals 64.6987 shares
of "Common Stock" (as defined in the Convertible Senior Notes Indenture) per
$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) _Section 3.3(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing
of all Persons who hold outstanding Company Options or Company RSUs as of the
close of business on June 13, 2019, indicating, with respect to each Company
Option or Company RSU, the number of Shares subject thereto, the date of grant
or issuance, the vesting schedule and, with respect to Company Options, the
exercise price, expiration date and whether such Company Option is an
incentive stock option (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code).

 



 

 **3.4** **SEC Filings; Financial Statements**.

 



 

(a) Since January 1, 2017, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including
exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required to be filed
or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented, modified or amended
since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of
the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment (and, in the case
of registration statements and proxy statements, on the date of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2001, as amended
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company SEC
Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and schedules)
contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents: (i)
complied in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be indicated in
the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any
successor form under the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly presented, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for
the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial
statements, to the absence of notes and to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments).

 



 

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since June 30, 2017, has
maintained, a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) which is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are

 



     

 

 



 

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. The CompanyÂ’s
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s
system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2018, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded that
those controls were effective. Since July 1, 2018, neither the Company nor the
CompanyÂ’s independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware
of: (1) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or
operation of the internal control over financial reporting utilized by the
Company, which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information; or (2) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves the management or other
employees of the Company who have a significant role in the CompanyÂ’s internal
control over financial reporting.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains and since January 1, 2017 has maintained disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in and required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15
under the Exchange Act that are reasonably designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed in the CompanyÂ’s reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer of the Company and
the principal financial officer of the Company to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company is,
and since January 1, 2017 has been, in compliance in all material respects
with all current listing and corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.

 



 

(e) No Acquired Corporation is a party to, nor does any Acquired Corporation
have any obligation or other commitment to become a party to, "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material

any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 



 

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to
Parent or Purchaser specifically for use in the Offer Documents, at the time
of the filing of and at the time of any distribution or dissemination of the

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on

Proceedings now pending or threatened in writing in respect of any material
Taxes, Tax Returns or other Tax matters of or with respect to any Acquired

such Acquired Corporation is or may be subject to Taxes in that jurisdiction.
The Acquired Corporations have delivered or made available to Parent accurate
and complete copies of all material audit reports and similar documents (to

has been granted and is currently in effect.

 



 

(d) No Legal Proceeding involving the IRS or any other Governmental Body is

Acquired Corporation in respect of any material Tax, and no deficiency of
material Taxes has been asserted in writing as a result of any audit,
examination, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other Legal Proceeding
by any Governmental Body that has not been paid or accrued for in the most
recent balance sheet included in the Company SEC documents in accordance with
GAAP and contested in good faith and in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(e) No Acquired Corporation (i) is or has been a member of any affiliated,
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group for purposes of filing Tax
Returns or paying Taxes (other than a group the common parent of which is or
was the Company or another Acquired Corporation), and (ii) has any material
liability for the Taxes of any other Person (other than the Acquired
Corporations) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar or analogous provision of state, local or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor or otherwise (other than pursuant to customary Tax
gross up or similar provisions contained in commercial agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business and not primarily relating to Taxes). No
Acquired Corporation is required to make any payments after the date hereof in
respect of any Taxes imposed under Section 965 of the Code.

 



 

(f) During the two (2)-year period ending on the date hereof, none of the

provision of state, local or non-U.S. law).

 



 

(g) No Acquired Corporation has participated in any "listed transaction"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) (or any
analogous or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law).

 



 

(h) The Acquired Corporations will not be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, the computation of taxable
income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date as a result of
transactions or events occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to the
Closing, (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or
any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. income Tax
law) executed prior to the Closing, (iii) installment sale or open transaction
disposition made prior to the Closing, (iv) prepaid amount received prior to
the Closing, (v) deferred intercompany gain or excess loss account described

corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law) or
(vi) election under Section 108(i) of the Code made prior to the Closing.

 



      

 

 



 

(i) No Acquired Corporation is party to or bound by any agreement or
arrangement with any Person relating to the apportionment, sharing,
assignment, indemnification or allocation of any Tax or Tax asset, other than
Tax gross up or similar provisions contained in commercial agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily relating to Taxes.

 



 

(j) There are no material Encumbrances with respect to Taxes upon any of the
assets or properties of any Acquired Corporation, other than with respect to
Taxes that are (i) not yet due and payable or (ii) currently being contested
in good faith through appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves
have been established, in accordance with GAAP, on the most recent balance
sheet included in the Company SEC Documents.

 



 

 **3.16** **Employee Matters; Benefit Plans**.

 



 

(a) The employment of each of the CompanyÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ employees is
terminable by the Company at will.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor organization
representing any of its employees. Since January 1, 2017, there has not been
any strike, lockout, labor dispute or union organizing activity, or any threat
thereof, by any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to
their employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2017,
the Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements related to employment and employment practices, including terms
and conditions of employment, wages and hours, discrimination, employee
classification, workersÂ’ compensation, family and medical leave, the
immigration and occupational safety and health requirements, and no Legal
Proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against any Acquired Corporation with respect to the foregoing. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole, each individual who
renders services to any Acquired Corporation who is classified as an
independent contractor, consultant or other non-employee status for any
purpose (including for purposes of taxation and Tax reporting and under
Employee Plans) is properly so characterized.

 



 

(c) _Section 3.16(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate and complete list of the material Employee Plans. To the extent
applicable, the Company has either delivered or made available to Parent prior
to the execution of this Agreement with respect to each material Employee Plan
accurate and complete copies of: (i) all plan documents and all amendments
thereto, and all related trust or other funding documents, and in the case of
unwritten material Employee Plans, written descriptions thereof, (ii) all
determination letters, rulings, opinion letters, information letters or
advisory opinions issued by the IRS or the United States Department of Labor
(" _DOL_ "), (iii) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any material
modifications thereto, (iv) the Form 5500 filed with the DOL for the last two
(2) plan years, (v) the most recently prepared financial statements or
actuarial reports and (vi) any other material correspondence with a
Governmental Body.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any other Person that would be or, at any relevant
time, would have been considered a single employer with the Company under the
Code or ERISA has ever maintained, contributed to, or been required to
contribute to, or otherwise incurred any liability with respect to, (i) a plan
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Code Section 412 or 4971,
including any "single employer" defined benefit plan or any "multiemployer
plan," each as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA, or (ii) a plan that has two
(2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.

 



 

(e) Each of the Employee Plans that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code, each such
Employee Plan has timely adopted all currently effective amendments to the
Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no existing
circumstances or any events that have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the qualified status of any such Employee Plan.
Each of the Employee Plans is now and has been operated in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and all applicable Legal Requirements,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. There are no pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) or
Legal Proceedings, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or Legal
Proceeding, against the Employee Plans, any fiduciaries thereof or the assets
of any related trusts. No Employee Plan is under audit or the subject of an
investigation by the IRS, the DOL, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
the SEC or any other Governmental Body, nor is any such audit or investigation
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. The Company is not
and could not reasonably be expected to be subject to either a material
liability pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a material Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. Each Employee Plan that is in any part a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code
complies in all material respects both in form and operation with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code. All contributions required to be
made to any Employee Plan by applicable Legal Requirements or otherwise, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Employee Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the financial statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA or 4980B
of the Code (or any other similar state or local Legal Requirement), neither
the Company nor any Employee Plan has any present or future obligation to
provide post-employment welfare benefits to or make any payment to, or with
respect to, any present or former employee, officer, director or other service
provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to any retiree medical
benefit plan or other retiree welfare plan.

 



 

(g) Except as provided in _Section 2.8_, the consummation of the Transactions
(including in combination with other events or circumstances) will not (i)
entitle any current or former employee, director, officer, independent
contractor or other service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other

 



     

 

 



 

payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting or
exercisability, or materially increase the amount of, compensation or benefits
due to any such employee, director, officer, independent contractor or other
service provider, (iii) directly or indirectly cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any compensation or
benefits under any Employee Plan, or (iv) result in any limitation on the
right of the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive
a reversion of assets from any Employee Plan or related trust. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether
in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions (including in combination
with other events or circumstances) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The Company has provided to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement true, correct and complete
copies of Section 280G calculations (based on the assumptions set forth
therein) with respect to six "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) in connection with the Transactions (including in
combination with other events or circumstances).

Section 4999 or 409A of the Code, or otherwise.

(d) There are and have been no Hazardous Materials present, used or disposed

(e) There are and have been no material Releases on, at, under or from any
property or facility, including the Leased Real Property.

the business, assets and operations of the Acquired Corporations. The Acquired
Corporations maintain insurance coverage in such amounts and covering such
risks as are in accordance in all material respects with normal industry
practice for companies of similar size and stage of development. All such
insurance policies are in full force and effect, no notice of cancellation or
material modification has been received (other than a notice in connection
with ordinary renewals), and there is no existing material default or event
which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default, by any insured thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement,

policies as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies.

capacity as such.

 **SECTION 5**

 



 

 ** _CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

 **5.1** **Access and Investigation**. During the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8_ (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), upon
reasonable advance notice to the Company, the Acquired Corporations shall, and
shall cause the respective Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to
provide Parent and ParentÂ’s Representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours of the Company to the CompanyÂ’s designated
Representatives and assets and to all existing books, records, documents and
information relating to the Acquired Corporations, and promptly provide Parent
and ParentÂ’s Representatives with all reasonably requested information
regarding the business of the Acquired Corporations and such additional
financial, operating and other data and information regarding the Acquired
Corporations, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any such access shall be conducted at ParentÂ’s expense, at a reasonable time,
under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Acquired Corporations
and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operation of the business of the Acquired Corporations. Nothing herein shall
require any of the Acquired Corporations to disclose any information to Parent
if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion and after notice to
Parent (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so long as
the Acquired Corporations have reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit
such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
waive such privilege with respect thereto), (ii) contravene any applicable

operations of the Acquired Corporations prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions hereof, complete control and
supervision of its and its, if applicable, SubsidiariesÂ’ respective
operations.

 



 

 **5.3** **No Solicitation**.

 



 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement that (i) contains
provisions that are not materially less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) does not prohibit the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.3_.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Corporations shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause their Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitation, knowing
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be
ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal as of the date of this
Agreement. In addition, except as permitted by this _Section 5.3_, during the
Pre-Closing Period the Acquired Corporations shall not, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not to, (i) continue
any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal as of the
date of this Agreement; (ii)(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement, agreement in principle
or similar agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal
or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
or (iii) waive or release any Person from, forebear in the enforcement of, or
amend any standstill agreement or any standstill provisions of any other
Contract, unless, solely in the case of this _clause (iii)_ , the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements, in which event the Acquired Corporations
may take the actions described in this _clause (iii)_ solely to the extent
necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis to the
Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such third party
agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any
information to Parent (including regarding any such Acquisition Proposal) in
accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this _Section 5.3_. As
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) business
days) following the date hereof, the Company shall request the prompt return
or destruction (to

 



     

 

 



 

the extent provided for by the applicable confidentiality agreement) of all
non-public information previously furnished to any Person (other than Parent)
that has, within the one (1)-year period prior to the date of this Agreement,
made or indicated an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal and the Company
shall, and shall cause the other Acquired Corporations to, terminate access by
any third Person who has made or would reasonably be expected to make an
Acquisition Proposal (other than Parent and its Representatives) to any data
room (virtual or actual) containing any confidential information of any
Acquired Corporation.

 



 

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Corporation or any of their Representatives
receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on
or after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach
of this _Section 5.3_, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Offer, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Acquired Corporations to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
that the Company shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-
public information concerning the Acquired Corporations that is provided to
any Person to the extent access to such information was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives and (y) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by any Acquired
Corporation or any Representative thereof and provide to Parent a copy of any
written Acquisition Proposal (including any proposed term sheet, letter of
intent, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect thereto) and a
summary of any material unwritten terms and conditions thereof, and (ii) keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis (and in any
event within 24 hours of such material development, discussion or
negotiation).

 



 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company
that is required by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , that this
_Section 5.3(e)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Board of Directors to make
a Company Adverse Change Recommendation except to the extent permitted by
_Section 6.1(b)_.

 



 

(f) The Company agrees that in the event any Acquired Corporation or any
Representative of an Acquired Corporation takes any action which, if taken by
the Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_, the Company
shall be deemed to be in breach of this _Section 5.3_.

 



     

 

 



 

 **SECTION 6**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES_**

 



 

 **6.1** **Company Board Recommendation**.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion
of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.
During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, neither the Board
of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser),
the Company Board Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or resolve, agree or publicly propose to adopt, approve, recommend
or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this
_clause (i)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Change Recommendation_
") or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or
enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede,
interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 



 

(i) if any Acquired Corporation has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in
good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Board
of Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) provided
that such Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a material breach of
_Section 5.3_, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_ to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior
Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of
its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ at least three (3)
business days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation
or termination (a " _Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination) and, if
desired by Parent, during such three (3)-business day period shall have
negotiated in good faith with respect to any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or another proposal to the extent proposed by Parent so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer; and (C) (1)
the Company shall have provided to Parent information with respect to such
Acquisition

 



     

 

 



 

Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_, (2) the Company shall have
given Parent the three (3)-business day period after the Determination Notice
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal
so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer,
and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such
period, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any
"stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or
compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 6.1_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice,
except that the references to three (3) business days shall be deemed to be
two (2) business days; and

 



 

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of
Directors may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice
at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation and, if desired by Parent, during such three
(3)-business day period shall have negotiated in good faith with respect to
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent
proposed by Parent so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no
longer be necessary; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances underlying the Intervening Event
that render a Company Adverse Change Recommendation necessary, (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the three (3)-business day period after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no
longer be necessary, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent during such period, if any, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the
failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. The provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to
any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event and require a new Determination Notice, except that for
purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice, the references to three (3)
business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days.

 



 

 **6.2** **Filings, Consents and Approvals**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take promptly
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental Body or any
other party, so as to enable the

 



     

 

 



 

Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in no case later than the End
Date, including providing as promptly as reasonably practicable all
information required by any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation of
the Transactions under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Parent and its
Affiliates shall not be required to sell, license, divest or dispose of or
hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), before or
after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any entities, assets,
Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of Parent (or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or agree or commit to any of the forgoing,
or agree to any restriction on the conduct of such businesses, and (ii) Parent
and its Affiliates shall not be required to, and without the prior written
consent of Parent the Acquired Corporations shall not, sell, license, divest
or dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), before or after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time,
any entities, assets, Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of the
Acquired Corporations (or any of their Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or
agree or commit to any of the foregoing, or agree to any restriction on the
conduct of such businesses if such remedies described in this _clause (ii)_
would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole. The
Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing
by the End Date.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to): (i)
promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date
hereof (unless Parent determines in good faith after consultation with the
Company that postponing such filings to a later date is advantageous for
purposes of satisfying the conditions to the Offer, in which case Parent shall
identify a reasonable later date after consultation with the Company regarding
such date and the Parties shall file on such later date), make an appropriate
filing of all notification and report forms as required by the HSR Act with
respect to the Transactions and (ii) cooperate with each other in determining
whether, and promptly preparing and making, any other filings, notifications
or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other
Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall (i) give the other
Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or
brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case, with
respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) keep the other
Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the other
Parties of, and wherever practicable give the other party reasonable advance
notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, any communication to or from
the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly
furnish to the other Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, with copies
of documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
(other than

 



     

 

 



 

"4(c) and 4(d) documents" as that term is used under the HSR Act, that
contain valuation information (which can be redacted)), (v) subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants, and to the extent reasonably practicable, consult and
cooperate with the other Parties and consider in good faith the views of the
other Parties in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation,
memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or
by any Legal Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, give
the other party reasonable advance notice of, and permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

 



 

(d) Without limiting in any respect ParentÂ’s obligations under this _Section
6.2_, Parent shall have the right to (i) direct, devise and implement the
strategy for obtaining any necessary approval of, for responding to any
request from, inquiry or investigation by (including directing the timing,
nature and substance of all such responses), and shall have the right to lead
all meetings and communications (including any negotiations) with, any
Governmental Body that has authority to enforce any Antitrust Law and (ii)
without limiting the generality of clause (i) of this _Section 6.2(d)_ or the
obligations of Parent under this _Section 6.2_, control the defense and
settlement of any litigation, action, suit, investigation or proceeding
brought by or before any Governmental Body that has authority to enforce any
Antitrust Law. Parent shall consult with the Company in a reasonable manner
and consider in good faith the views and comments of the Company in connection
with the foregoing.

 



 

 **6.3** **Employee Benefits**.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who is employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any
Affiliate thereof) during such one (1)-year period (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that
provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) incentive compensation opportunities that
are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Affiliates and (iii) employee benefits that in the aggregate
are no less favorable than the employee benefits (excluding benefits under the
Company ESPP) provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired Corporation
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing:

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s health and welfare benefit plans
(to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate
under the CompanyÂ’s health and welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time); _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan upon or following the
Effective Time then the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate
in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s (or an AffiliateÂ’s) corresponding health and
welfare benefit plans. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility
or vesting under any benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
then Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, credit
Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors to the same extent that
such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding benefit plan of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits, and Parent and its Affiliates shall not
be required to provide credit for any purpose under any equity incentive plan,
defined benefit pension plan, postretirement welfare plan or any plan under
which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates do not receive
credit for prior service or that is grandfathered or frozen. In addition,
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall credit each Continuing Employee
with paid time off equal to the accrued paid time off such Continuing Employee
had accrued with the Company that was unused as of the Effective Time,
_provided_ that such accrued paid time off is reflected in the CompanyÂ’s books
and records. For purposes of determining the amount of paid time off
Continuing Employees are eligible to accrue with respect to periods following
the Effective Time only, to the extent that service is relevant for accruals
following the Effective Time under ParentÂ’s paid time off policy, Parent shall
ensure that any employee plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall
credit Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the
Company to the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the
Effective Time. For purposes of crediting paid time off that was accrued prior
to the Effective Time and accruals following the Effective Time, this Section
6.3(b) shall not require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates
to provide a Continuing Employee with accruals of paid time off during the
year in which the Closing occurs (or such later year in which the Continuing
Employees commence accruing under ParentÂ’s paid time off policy) that would be
duplicative of accruals of paid time off such Continuing Employee already
accrued for the same period of that year.

 



 

(c) Following the Effective Time Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under any plan of Parent or an Affiliate that provides health
benefits in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following
the Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with
respect to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding Employee Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior
to transitioning into a plan of Parent or an Affiliate during the portion of
the calendar year prior to such transition in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or an
Affiliate, in each case to the extent recognized for such purpose under an
analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would
otherwise be

 



     

 

 



 

applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee
or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Employee Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Parent acknowledges that, upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time, a
"Change in Control" (or "Change of Control" as the case may be) of the Company
shall have occurred for purposes of each of the Employee Plans in which such
definition appears.

 



 

(e) Parent shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each
Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of employment from Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period with
severance benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those
that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee by any Acquired
Corporation under the applicable severance policies set forth on _Section
6.3(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule had such termination occurred prior
to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
fifteen (15) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors (or
the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Company
401(k) Savings Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the day
prior to the Closing Date, contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. The
form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions taken in
connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the review and
approval of Parent. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, as provided
herein, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, have in effect
a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan as of the Effective Time
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") in which each
Continuing Employee who is actively employed at the Closing shall be eligible
to participate as of the Closing, and as soon as practicable following the
Closing (or, if Parent determines in its sole discretion that a determination
letter is appropriate, as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plan) the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by the Parent 401(k) Plan, permit such
Continuing Employees to make rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan
of "eligible rollover distributions" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code (including promissory notes evidencing outstanding participant
loans), in the form of cash (and in-kind in the case of participant loan
notes), in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to permit
each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the Company
401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date to continue to make scheduled loan payments
to the Company 401(k) Plan after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-
kind rollover of the notes evidencing such loans from the Company 401(k) Plan
to the Parent 401(k) Plan so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible,
a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loans,
provided that, as a condition to the foregoing, such Continuing Employees
shall cooperate with the

 



      

 

 



 

Company and Parent to take appropriate action to make rollover contributions
to the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time.

 



 

(g) Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, any notices or
communication materials (including website postings) from any Acquired
Corporation to its employees, or from Parent or Purchaser to any Acquired
CorporationÂ’s employees, with respect to the Transactions or employment,
compensation or benefits matters of such employees that are impacted by the
Transactions or relate to the period following the Closing Date, shall be
subject to the prior review and comment of Parent or the Company, as
applicable.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are solely for the benefit of the
Parties, and no provision of this _Section 6.3_ is intended to, or shall,
constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee
benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to
enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Person to
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of
the Surviving Corporation or to any compensation or benefits and the
employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 



 

 **6.4** **ESPP**. The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to
the terms of the Company ESPP or otherwise to provide that (i) no new offering
period will be commenced following the date hereof under the Company ESPP,
(ii) there will be no increase in the amount of participantsÂ’ payroll
deduction elections under the Company ESPP during the current offering period
from those in effect as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) no individuals
shall commence participation in the Company ESPP during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, (iv) each purchase right
issued pursuant to the Company ESPP shall be fully exercised not later than
five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time and (v) the Company ESPP
shall terminate immediately following the exercise of the purchase rights
contemplated by the immediately preceding clause (iv) and no further rights
shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP thereafter. Any
disqualifying disposition of Shares acquired under the Company ESPP shall be
subject to Tax reporting and withholding in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

 **6.5** **Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) now
existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of any
Acquired Corporation and any indemnification or other similar agreements of
any Acquired Corporation set forth on _Section 6.5(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and
Parent shall cause the Acquired Corporations to perform their obligations
thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving

 



     

 

 



 

Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of any Acquired Corporation or who is as of the date of this
Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at
the request of any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another
Person (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director
or officer of any Acquired Corporation or is or was serving at the request of
any Acquired Corporation as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, in accordance with the organizational documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
and (y) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance
maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired Corporations or provide
substitute policies for the Acquired Corporations and their current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the
benefit of the Acquired Corporations, in either case, of not less than the
existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable in the aggregate
to the insured persons than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired
Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by
the Acquired Corporations prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance
required by this _Section 6.5(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six (6)-year period for a
premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the
Closing Date the Company may (through an insurance broker approved by Parent
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)), and,
if prior to the Closing the Company has not, Parent may, purchase a "tail"
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy for the Acquired
Corporations and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by or for

 



     

 

 



 

the benefit of the Acquired Corporations, such tail to provide coverage in an
amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by or for the benefit of the Acquired
Corporations with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of
any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Acquired Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Acquired Corporation,
as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors
and assigns of such Acquired Corporation assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ (i) shall survive the acceptance of
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Persons), his or
her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and (iii) are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by applicable Legal
Requirement, this _Section 6.5_ may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors, assigns or heirs without
the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Person.

 



 

 **6.6** **Stockholder Litigation**. The Company shall give Parent the right
to review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any litigation against the Company and/or its
directors or officers relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult
on any settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s prior written consent. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably
and promptly informed with respect to the status thereof.

 



 

 **6.7** **Additional Agreements**. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including _Section 6.2(a)_, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give all notices
(if any) required to be made and given by such Party pursuant to any Material
Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the other
Transactions, (b) seek each Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant
to any Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions to
the extent requested in writing by Parent and (c) seek to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third
Person against such Party.

 



     

 

 



 

 **6.8** **Disclosure**. The initial press release relating to this Agreement
shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
further press release(s) or otherwise making any public statement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or public statement
without the other PartyÂ’s written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a)
each Party may, without such consultation or consent, make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required
by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement of filing
to be issued or made pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_ or with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 



 

 **6.9** **Takeover Laws**. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to
be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of the
Transactions.

 



 

 **6.10** **Section 16 Matters**. The Company, and the Board of Directors,
shall, to the extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the
Offer Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and

each agreement, arrangement or understanding between Purchaser, the Company or
their respective Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries that are effective as of the date of this
Agreement or are entered into after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to which compensation is paid to such
officer, director or employee and will take all other action reasonably
necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set
forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **6.12** **Credit Agreement**. The Company shall, and shall cause each other
Acquired Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices
and take all other actions

 



     

 

 



 

reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser that are required to facilitate in
accordance with the terms thereof the termination of all commitments, if any,
outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all
obligations outstanding thereunder, the release of all Encumbrances securing
such obligations, and the release of guarantees, if any, in connection
therewith on the Closing Date as of the Effective Time (such termination,
repayment and releases, the " _Credit Facility Terminations_ "). In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver to
Parent and Purchaser no later than three (3) business days prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time an executed payoff letter with respect to the Credit Agreement
in form and substance customary for transactions of this type, from the lender
under the Credit Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ "), which Payoff Letter
together with any related release documentation shall, among other things,
include the payoff amount and provide that Encumbrances (and any guarantees)
granted in connection therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties
of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing such indebtedness and any other
obligations secured thereby, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth

and terminated. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall this _Section 6.12_ require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
cause the Credit Facility Terminations to be effective unless and until the
Effective Time has occurred and Parent or Purchaser has provided or caused to
be provided to the Company or its Subsidiaries funds (or Parent or Purchaser
has directed the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries to use funds on
their balance sheet) to pay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of
and accrued and unpaid interest and fees under the Credit Agreement.

 



 

 **6.13** **Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration**. Prior to the Closing

the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of
the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 



 

 **6.14** **Convertible Senior Notes**. Within the time periods required by
the terms of the Convertible Senior Notes Indenture, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall take all actions required by, or reasonably requested by
Parent or Purchaser pursuant to and in compliance with, the Convertible Senior
Notes Indenture and applicable Legal Requirement to be performed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time as a result of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, including the giving of any notices that may be required or
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time and
delivery to the trustee, holders or other applicable Person, as applicable, of
any documents or instruments required or reasonably requested by Parent or
Purchaser to be delivered prior to the Effective Time to such trustee, holders
or other applicable Person, in each case in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Transactions or as otherwise required by, or
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to and in compliance
with, the Convertible Senior Notes Indenture; _provided_ that, in the event of
the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, Parent and
Purchaser shall reimburse the Acquired Corporations, as applicable, for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the
Acquired Corporation in connection with any such request by

 



     

 

 



 

Parent or Purchaser; _provided further_ that the Company (or such applicable
Subsidiary) shall deliver a copy of any such notice or other document to
Parent and Purchaser at least three (3) business days prior to delivering or
entering into such notice or other document in accordance with the terms of
the Convertible Senior Notes Indenture. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees to cooperate with Parent and Purchaser by (i)
executing and delivering (or causing to be executed and delivered, as
applicable) at the Effective Time, a supplemental indenture, officerÂ’s
certificate and opinion of counsel, in each case in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and Purchaser, pursuant to the Convertible

Acquired Corporations, taken as a whole, (iv) the mandatory or voluntary
termination, enjoinment or suspension of the testing, manufacturing,

any other action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger or making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger
illegal, which order, decree, ruling or other action shall be final and
nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this

termination;

 



 

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of

perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of the
Company shall have occurred such that a condition set forth in _clause (b)_
or _(c)_ of _Annex I_ would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the
Company by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time period,
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date Parent gives the
Company written notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ if either Parent or Purchaser is then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
hereunder which breach would permit the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_;

 



 

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or

cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or, if capable
of being cured in such time period, shall not have been cured within thirty
(30) days of the date the Company gives Parent written notice of such breach
or failure to perform; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_

were tested as of the date of such breach instead of as of the Offer
Acceptance Time); or

 



 

(h) by the Company (i) if following the expiration of the Offer, Purchaser

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the final sentence of _Section 1.2(b)_,
the final sentence of _Section 5.1_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_; or

 



 

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at
such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to the proviso to _Section 8.1(b)_) or by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_, (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination and
such Acquisition Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such
termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or consummated
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause (z)_
the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be
deemed to be references to "50%";

 



 

(c) then, in any such event under _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of
_Section 8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of _Section

business days after such termination or (z) in the case of _Section

to in _clause (z)_ of _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_; it being understood that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. As used herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $400,000,000. Payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(c)_ shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates

 



     

 

 



 

arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions
or any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ , that the

(d) In the event of any termination described in _Section 8.3(b)_, (i)
payment from the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section

their respective Affiliates against the Acquired Corporations and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company
Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and (ii) upon payment of such amount(s), none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing shall not relieve any Company Related Party from any
liability for fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

 



 

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section 8.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

 **9.2** **Waiver**. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties
of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants
contained herein. Any such

 



      

 

 



 

extension or waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 



 

 **9.3** **No Survival of Representations and Warranties**. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

 



 

 **9.4** **Entire Agreement; Counterparts**. This Agreement (including its
Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties
and their respective Affiliates, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including
by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties.

 



 

 **9.5** **Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if (but only
if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District
Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any appellate
court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii) each of
the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 9.9_. Each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in the
foregoing shall restrict any PartyÂ’s rights to seek any post-judgment relief
regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section 9.5(a)_ without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific performance is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY
HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
THEREOF. EACH PARTY (I) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



 

 **9.6** **Assignability**. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a
Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any
attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such
consent shall be void and of no effect.

 



 

 **9.7** **No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; except for: (a) if the Offer Acceptance Time occurs,
(i) the right of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders to receive the Offer Price or
Merger Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 1_ or _Section 2_
following the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) the right of the holders
of Company Options and Company RSUs to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.8_ following the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement; (b) the provisions set forth in _Section 6.5_ of
this Agreement; and (c) the limitations on liability of the Company Related
Parties set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_.

 



     

 

 



 

 **9.8** **Transfer Taxes**. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.6(b)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar Taxes imposed on the Company with respect to the transfer of Shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Merger shall be borne by the Company and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares. The Company shall
cooperate with Parent and Purchaser in minimizing any such Taxes.

 



 

 **9.9** **Notices**. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
to be delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon receipt when
delivered by hand, (b) two (2) business days after being sent by registered
mail or by courier or express delivery service, (c) if sent by email or

 **9.10** **Severability**. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision

delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to

such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,
the Parties agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision
