ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

 

This Assignment and Assumption Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
April 1, 2015, (the " _Effective Date_ "), is made by and between Dominion
Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _Assignor_ "), and Dominion
Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" _Assignee_ "),
pursuant to  _Section 5.2_ of that certain Purchase, Sale and Contribution
Agreement, dated as of the Effective Date, among Assignor, Dominion MLP
Holding Company II, Inc., a Virginia corporation (" _MLP Holdco_ ") and
Assignee (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and the mutual agreements and
covenants set forth herein, including the foregoing premises which are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement, the parties hereby agree as follows:

conveys and delivers to Assignee any and all of Assignors rights and
interests under the Original Company Acquisition Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, and hereby designates Assignee to perform
Assignors obligations under the Original Company Acquisition Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement, in each case with the exception of (a) the
payment or receipt of the Original Company Acquisition Agreement Post Closing
Adjustment, and (b) the post-closing covenants set forth in _Section 6.3_ of
the Original Company Acquisition Agreement, which shall be retained by
Assignor (collectively, the " _Assignment_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
pursuant to terms of the Original Company Acquisition Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, Assignor nonetheless shall remain responsible for
the performance of all of its obligations under Original Company Acquisition
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

2\. _Assumption_. As of the Closing, Assignee hereby accepts the Assignment,
and assumes performance of Assignors obligations under the Original Company
Acquisition Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, in each case with the
exception of (a) the payment or receipt of the Original Company Acquisition
Agreement Post Closing Adjustment, and (b) the post-closing covenants set
forth in _Section 6.3_ of the Original Company Acquisition Agreement, which
shall be retained by Assignor (the " _Assumption_ ").

 

3\. _Further Assurances_. On and after the Effective Date, the parties shall
take any and all further actions, including but not limited to the execution
and delivery of additional instruments or documents, that may be reasonably
requested in writing by any one of them to effectuate or evidence the
Assignment or the Assumption, or the other actions expressly contemplated
by this Agreement.

4\. _Severability._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable for any reason, unless narrowed by construction, this Agreement
shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision
had been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable.

5\. _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of
law. Each of the parties hereto agrees (a) that this Agreement involves at
least $100,000.00, and (b) that this Agreement has been entered into by the
parties hereto in express reliance upon 6 Del. C. § 2708\. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees (i) that it is and shall
continue to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of  Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware, and
(ii)(A) to the extent that such party is not otherwise subject to service of
process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process and
notify the other parties hereto of the name and address of such agent, and (B)
to the fullest extent permitted by law, that service of process may also be
made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the U.S. Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service,
and that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service
made pursuant to (ii)(A) or (B) above shall have the same legal force and
effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
considered an original but which together shall be deemed one and the same
instrument. An executed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email
or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same
legal effect as delivery of an original executed copy of this Agreement.

---|---|--- 
    Initial Principal Amount: |  | Richmond, Virginia 
  $295,331,972.00 |  | April 1, 2015 
 

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Dominion Midstream Partners, LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (the " _Maker_ "), promises to pay to Dominion MLP Holding
Company II, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the " _Noteholder_ ," which term
shall include any subsequent holder hereof), in lawful money of the United
States of America, the original principal sum of Two Hundred Ninety-Five
Million Three Hundred Thirty-One Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Two and 00/100
Dollars ($295,331,972.00) (the " _Initial Principal Amount_ "), as the same
may be increased or decreased as provided hereinafter, together with interest
on the unpaid principal balance at the rate and on the terms hereinafter
provided in this promissory note (including all modifications, amendments,
substitutions, renewals or extensions hereof and allonges hereto, this "
_Note_ "). This Note is being issued pursuant to the terms of that certain
Purchase, Sale and Contribution Agreement dated as of the date hereof among
Dominion Resources, Inc., a Virginia corporation, the Maker and the
Noteholder (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Purchase
Agreement_ "). The Initial Principal Amount shall be automatically increased
or decreased, as applicable, in an amount equal to the Closing Adjustment
Amount as defined in, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the
Purchase Agreement, and all references in this Note to the principal hereof
shall mean the Initial Principal Amount as so increased or decreased. For
purposes of this Note, any such increase or decrease shall be effective as of
the date of this Note.

1\. _Interest Rate._ Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of
this Note from the date hereof at the annual rate equal to six tenths of one
percent (0.6%). Interest shall be paid for the actual number of days elapsed
based on a 360-day year.

 

2\. _Payments; Maturity._ Interest only on the unpaid principal balance of
this Note shall be due and payable beginning on the first (1st) day of July,
2015 and continuing on the first (1st) day of each October, January, April and
July thereafter until this Note has been paid in full. If not sooner paid,
the entire principal balance, all accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and all
other sums provided herein shall be due and payable in full on April 1, 2017
(the " _Initial Maturity Date_ "). All payments of principal, interest, fees,
expenses and other amounts to be paid by the Maker under this Note shall be
paid not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date when due in immediately available
funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind, at
the address of the Noteholder set forth in the Purchase Agreement or at such
other address as the Noteholder shall specify in writing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if on the Initial Maturity Date no Event of Default
(as hereinafter defined) has occurred and is continuing and no other event
has occurred and is continuing which, with the lapse of time, the giving of
notice or both, would constitute an Event of Default (a " _Default_ "), then
the Maker may extend the maturity date of this Note to October 1, 2017 by so
notifying the Noteholder in writing on or before the Initial Maturity Date.

 



1 3\. _Prepayment._ This Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time without premium or penalty. Any prepayment shall include
interest accrued to the date of such prepayment and all other sums then due
under this Note. No partial prepayment shall affect the obligation of the
Maker to make any payment of principal or interest due hereunder on the date
hereinabove specified until this Note has been paid in full.

4\. _Application of Payments._ Payments or prepayments on this Note shall be
applied to amounts due hereunder in such order as the Noteholder may
determine.

 

5\. _Default Rate; Late Charge._ Upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, the principal balance of this Note and
any other sum then due hereunder (including, to the extent permitted by law,
any overdue installment of interest) shall bear interest at an annual rate of
three percent (3%) above the interest rate set forth above. In addition, the
Maker shall pay to the Noteholder, upon demand, a late charge equal to five
percent (5%) of any amount due which is not received within seven (7) days
after its due date. Acceptance by the Noteholder of any late payment without
an accompanying late charge shall not be deemed a waiver of the Noteholders
right to receive such late charge or to receive a late charge for any
subsequent payment received more than seven (7) days after its due date.

 

6\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Maker hereby represents and warrants
to the Noteholder that:

duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of

registered or qualified would have a material adverse effect on the Maker
and its subsidiaries, their business, operations or financial condition
(considered as a whole), the ability of the Maker to pay its obligations under
this Note, the validity or enforceability of this Note or the rights or
remedies of the Noteholder against the Maker under this Note (a " _Material
Adverse Effect_ ") and (c) has the requisite power and authority to own its

partnership and partnership agreement, (b) 

 



2  violate, contravene or materially conflict with any law, regulation, order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree or permit applicable to it, (c) violate,
contravene or materially conflict with contractual provisions of, or cause an
event of default under, any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed of
trust, contract or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by
which it may be bound, the violation of which could have a Material Adverse
Effect or (d) result in or require the creation of any lien, security interest
or encumbrance (a " _Lien_ ") upon or with respect to its properties.

 

(d) _Consents_. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing,
registration or qualification with, any court, governmental authority or

which would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

filed, all material tax returns (federal, state, local and foreign) required
to be filed by it and paid all material amounts of taxes shown thereon to be
due (including interest and penalties) and has paid all other material taxes,
fees, assessments and other governmental

 



3  charges (including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes and
intangibles taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes which are not yet
delinquent or that are being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings, and against which adequate reserves are being maintained in
accordance with GAAP.

(k) _Compliance with Law_. Each of the Maker and its subsidiaries is in
compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, orders and decrees applicable to

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, the " _Acts_ "), which
includes financial information required by such Form 10-K, such financial
information to be in reasonable form and detail and audited by an independent
registered public accounting firm of recognized national standing reasonably
acceptable to the Noteholder and whose opinion shall be to the effect that
such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except
for changes with which such accountants concur) and shall not be limited as

the effect that such quarterly financial statements fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition of the Maker and have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP, subject to changes resulting from audit and
normal year-end audit adjustments.

statements provided for in Sections 7.1(a)(i) and 7.1(a)(ii) above, a
certificate of the chief financial officer or treasurer of the Maker, stating

request.

after the earlier of the Maker becoming aware of such default or notice

the Maker or any of its subsidiaries: (i) a court or governmental agency
having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief
in respect of the Maker or its subsidiary in an involuntary case under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
in effect, or appoint a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Maker or its subsidiary or for any

 



7  substantial part of its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation
of its affairs; or (ii) an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy,

against the Maker or its subsidiary and such petition remains unstayed and in
effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or (iii) the Maker or its

assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) the Maker or its subsidiary
shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they
become due or any action shall be taken by such Person in furtherance of any
of the aforesaid purposes.

 

(f) _Defaults under Other Agreements_. With respect to any indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Maker or any of its subsidiaries in a principal amount
in excess of $10,000,000, (i) the Maker or its subsidiary shall (A) default in
any payment (beyond the applicable grace period with respect thereto, if any)
with respect to any such indebtedness, or (B) default (after giving effect to
any applicable grace period) in the observance or performance of any covenant
or agreement relating to such indebtedness or contained in any instrument or
agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or any other event
or condition shall occur or condition exist, the effect of which default or
other event or condition under (A) or (B) above is to cause, or permit, the
holder or holders of such indebtedness (or trustee or agent on behalf of such
holders) to cause any such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated
maturity; or (ii) any such indebtedness shall be declared due and payable, or
required to be prepaid other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment
or mandatory redemption, prior to the stated maturity thereof; or (iii) any
such indebtedness matures and is not paid at maturity.

(g) _Judgments_. One or more judgments, orders, or decrees shall be entered

order or decree becomes final and unappealable.

9\. _Acceleration Upon Event of Default._ Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, the entire unpaid balance of this Note, any accrued but unpaid
interest and all other sums provided herein shall, at the option of the
Noteholder, immediately become due and payable. The failure of the Noteholder
to exercise such option to accelerate upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to exercise such option upon
the occurrence of a subsequent Event of Default. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in Section 8(e) shall occur, then
the entire unpaid balance of this Note, any accrued but unpaid interest and
all other sums provided herein shall immediately become due and payable
without the giving of any notice or other action by the Noteholder. Any
payments received by the Noteholder may be applied to such amounts due
hereunder and in such order as the Noteholder may determine in its sole
discretion.

 



8 10\. _Acceptance of Partial Payment._ The acceptance by the Noteholder of a
partial payment of any sum due under this Note, whether occurring before or
after an Event of Default, shall not be deemed to cure the Makers failure to
pay such sum in full or to waive any of the Noteholders rights or remedies
available on account of such default. In addition, after the Noteholder has
accelerated payment of this Note upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
the tender of payment of less than the entire principal amount of this Note,
all interest thereon, late charges and other sums due under this Note, or the
acceptance by the Noteholder of less than full payment thereof, shall not be
deemed to have cured the Event of Default, to constitute a reinstatement of
this Note or to waive any of the Noteholders rights and remedies under this
Note or at law or in equity.

11\. _Waivers, etc._ The Maker and each endorser, surety and guarantor
hereof jointly and severally (i) waive presentment, demand, protest and
notice of dishonor, (ii) waive, to the extent permitted by law, all
exemptions, whether homestead or otherwise, as to the obligation evidenced by
this Note, (iii) waive any right which they may have to require the
Noteholder to proceed against any other party or foreclose on any collateral
given to secure the payment of this Note, (iv) agree that, without notice to
the Maker or any other party and without affecting any such partys
liability, the Noteholder, at any time or times, may grant extensions of the
time for any payment due on this Note, release any such party from its
obligation to make payments on this Note, permit the renewal of this Note or
permit the substitution, exchange or release of any security or collateral for
this Note, (v) waive any right they may have to require reinstatement of this
Note after the occurrence of an Event of Default and (vi) waive, to
the extent permitted by law, any right they may have to a trial by jury in
any action or proceeding to enforce or collect this Note, whether such action
or proceeding is instituted by the Noteholder, the Maker or any other party.

 

12\. _Notices_. All notices and other communications provided for in this Note
shall be in writing and shall have been duly given and shall be effective (a)
when delivered, (b) when transmitted via telecopy (or other facsimile device),
(c) the Business Day following the day on which the same has been delivered
prepaid (or pursuant to an invoice arrangement) to a reputable national
overnight air courier service, or (d) the third Business Day following the day
on which the same is sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, in
each case to the respective parties at the addresses set forth in the
Purchase Agreement, or at such other address as such party may specify by
written notice to the other parties hereto; provided, that, in the case of a
notice or other communication given pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above, if
such notice or other communication is not delivered or transmitted during the
normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be
deemed to be effective on the next Business Day for the recipient. 

13\. _Right of Set Off_. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such
rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and the commencement of
remedies described in

 



9  Section 9, the Noteholder is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind (all of which
rights being hereby expressly waived), to set-off and to appropriate and
apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other indebtedness,
obligations, liabilities and claims at any time held or owing by the
Noteholder or any of its subsidiaries to or for the credit or the account of
the Maker against obligations and liabilities of the Maker to the Noteholder
hereunder, irrespective of whether the Noteholder shall have made any demand
hereunder and although such indebtedness, obligations, liabilities or claims,
or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured, and any such set-off shall be
deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books of the
Noteholder subsequent thereto. 

14\. _No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay on the part of the
Noteholder in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder and no
course of dealing between the Maker and the Noteholder shall operate as a
waiver hereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder.
The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies which the Noteholder would otherwise have. No notice to
or demand on the Maker in any case shall entitle the Maker to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the Noteholder to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand. 

15\. _Payment of Expenses, etc_. The Maker agrees to: (a) pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Noteholder (including, without

delivery of any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto including, but
not limited to, any such amendments, waivers or consents resulting from or
related to any work-out, renegotiation or restructure relating to the
performance by the Maker under this Note and (ii) the enforcement of
this Note against the Maker; and (b) indemnify the Noteholder, its
subsidiaries and other affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents from and hold each of them harmless
against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or reasonable
expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any
way related to, or by reason of, any investigation, litigation or other
proceeding (whether or not the Noteholder or any of its subsidiaries is a
party thereto, or whether or not such investigation, litigation or other
proceeding was initiated by the Maker or any other party) related to the
entering into and/or performance of this Note or the use of proceeds of any
loans or other extensions of credit pursuant hereto or the consummation of
any other transactions contemplated in this Note by the Maker, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred
in connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding
(but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to
the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the
part of the person or entity to be indemnified, in each case, as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction).

 



10 16\. _Headings_. The headings of the sections and subsections hereof are
provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
construction of any provision of this Note.

17\. _Survival of Indemnification and Representations and Warranties_. All
indemnities set forth herein and all representations and warranties made
herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Note and the repayment
of all sums due hereunder.

 

18\. _GOVERNING LAW; SERVICE OF PROCESS_. THIS NOTE AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA,
WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES. The Maker irrevocably consents
to the service of process out of any competent court in any action
or proceeding brought in connection with this Note by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Maker at its
address for notices pursuant to Section 12, such service to become effective
thirty (30) days after such mailing. Nothing herein shall affect the right of
the Noteholder to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

19\. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS NOTE HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

20\. _Severability_. If any provision of this Note is determined to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be
construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions.

21\. _Entirety_. This Note represents the entire agreement of the parties
hereto, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, if any, including any commitment letters or correspondence relating
to the transactions contemplated herein.

 

22\. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The Maker hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of any court, federal or state, within the Commonwealth of
Virginia having subject matter jurisdiction arising under this Note, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Note, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Virginia state court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by 

 



11  suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Note shall affect any right that the Noteholder may otherwise have to bring
any action or proceeding relating to this Note against the Maker or its
properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. The Maker hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Note in any court referred to above. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court. The Maker also hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding
referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
damages.

23\. _Successors and Assigns_. This Note shall inure to the benefit of
and shall be binding on the parties hereto and their respective heirs,

ARTICLE II

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

Section 2.01. _Demand Registration_. Upon the written request (a " _Notice_ ")
by MLP Holdco or by any other Holder[s] owning at least ten percent (10%) of
the then-outstanding Registrable Securities (subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.04_), the Partnership shall file with the Commission, as soon as
reasonably practicable, but in no event more than 90 days following the
receipt of the Notice, a registration statement (each, a " _Registration
Statement_ ") under the Securities Act providing for the resale of the
Registrable Securities (which may, at the option of the Holders giving such
Notice, be a registration statement under the Securities Act that provides for
the resale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 from time to
time by the Holders (a " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ")). The Partnership
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as reasonably
practicable after the initial filing of the Registration Statement. Any
Registration Statement shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders of
any and all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. The
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01_ to be
continuously effective, supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that it is available for the resale of all Registrable Securities by
the Holders until all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement have ceased to be Registrable Securities (the " _Effectiveness
Period_ "). Each Registration Statement when effective (and the documents
incorporated therein by reference) shall comply as to form in all material
respects

 



3  with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and shall not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. There shall be no limit on the number of Registration Statements
that may be required by the Holders hereunder.

 

Section 2.02. _Underwritten Offerings_.

 

(a) _Request for Underwritten Offering_. In the event that one or more Holders
collectively elect to dispose of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the then-
outstanding Registrable Securities (subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section
3.04_) under a Registration Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering,
the Partnership shall, upon written request by such Holders, retain
underwriters in order to permit such Holders to effect such sale through an
Underwritten Offering. The obligation of the Partnership to retain
underwriters shall include entering into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Managing Underwriter(s), which shall include
customary indemnities in favor of, and taking all reasonable actions as are
requested by, the Managing Underwriter(s) to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities. The Partnership shall, upon
request of the Holders, cause its management to participate in a roadshow or
similar marketing effort on behalf of the Holders.

 

(b) _Limitation on Underwritten Offerings_. In no event shall the Partnership
be required under _Section 2.02(a)_ to participate in more than two
Underwritten Offerings in any twelve-month period.

(c) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under
this Agreement, the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities being
sold in such Underwritten Offering shall be entitled, subject to the
Partnerships consent (which is not to be unreasonably withheld), to select
the Managing Underwriter(s). In connection with any Underwritten Offering
under this Agreement, each Selling Holder and the Partnership shall be
obligated to enter into an underwriting agreement that contains such
representations and warranties, covenants, indemnities and other rights and
obligations as are customary in underwriting agreements for firm commitment
offerings of securities. No Selling Holder may participate in such
Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder agrees to sell its
Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting agreement
and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities
and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its option, require that any or all of
the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part
of, the Partnership to and for the benefit of such underwriters also be made
to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to such Selling Holders
obligations. If any Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an
underwriting, such Selling Holder may elect to withdraw from the Underwritten
Offering by notice to the Partnership and the Managing Underwriter(s);
_provided, however_ , that such withdrawal must be made at a time prior to
the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. No such withdrawal shall
affect the Partnerships obligation to pay Registration Expenses.

 

Section 2.03. _Delay Rights_. If the General Partner determines that the
Partnerships compliance with its obligations under this _Article II_ would
be materially detrimental to the

 



4  Partnership and its Partners because such registration would (a) materially
interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization, financing or other
similar transaction involving the Partnership, (b) require premature
disclosure of material information that the Partnership has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential or (c) render the Partnership
unable to comply with applicable securities laws, then the Partnership shall
have the right to postpone compliance with its obligations under this _Article
II_ for a period of not more than three months, provided, that such right
pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ may not be utilized more than twice in any
twelve-month period.

Section 2.04. _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under
this  _Article II_ , the Partnership will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
each Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep each Registration Statement effective for the
Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

(b) if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing
of an Underwritten Offering and the Managing Underwriter(s) notifies the
Partnership in writing that, in the sole judgment of such Managing
Underwriter(s), inclusion of detailed information in such prospectus
supplement is of material importance to the success of the Underwritten
Offering of such Registrable Securities, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to include such information in such prospectus supplement;

 

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing a Registration Statement or any supplement or
amendment thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all
such documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules
and regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder and
its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the corrections
reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such information
prior to filing a Registration Statement or supplement or amendment thereto,
and (ii) such number of copies of such Registration Statement and the
prospectus included therein and any supplements and amendments thereto as
such Persons may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or
other disposition of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement;

 

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement under
the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders
or, in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter(s),
shall reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership will
not be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not
then so subject;

  



5 (e) promptly notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time when
a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i) the
filing of a Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement
to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, when the same has become effective; and (ii) any written
comments from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in clause
(i) and any written request by the Commission for amendments or supplements
to a Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement
thereto;

(f) immediately notify each Selling Holder and each underwriter, at any time
when a prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of (i)
the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus or prospectus
supplement contained in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading (in the case of the prospectus contained therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made); (ii) the
issuance or threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue
sky laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the
Partnership agrees to, as promptly as practicable, amend or supplement the
prospectus or prospectus supplement or take other appropriate action so that
the prospectus or prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in
the light of the circumstances then existing and to take such other
commercially reasonable action as is necessary to remove a stop order,
suspension, threat thereof or proceedings related thereto;

 

(g) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to any offering of
Registrable Securities;

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request, (i) an
opinion of counsel for the Partnership dated the date of the closing under
the underwriting agreement and (ii) a "cold comfort" letter, dated the pricing
date of such Underwritten Offering (to the extent available) and a letter of
like kind dated the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement, in
each case, signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the
Partnerships financial statements included or incorporated by reference into
the applicable registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "cold
comfort" letter shall be in customary form and covering substantially the same
matters with respect to such registration statement (and the prospectus and
any prospectus supplement included therein) as have been customarily covered
in opinions of issuers counsel and in accountants letters delivered to the
underwriters in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership and
such other matters as such underwriters and Selling Holders may reasonably
request;

 



6 (i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter(s) and Selling Holders access to such information and Partnership
personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a
due diligence defense under the Securities Act;

 

(k) cause all Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement to
be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized quotation
system on which similar securities issued by the Partnership are then listed;

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate
the disposition of the Registrable Securities;

(m) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities
covered by a Registration Statement not later than the effective date of such
registration statement; and

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities.

 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening of any event of the kind described in subsection (f) of this
_Section 2.04_, shall forthwith discontinue disposition of the Registrable
Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until such
Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by subsection (f) of this _Section 2.04_ or until it
is advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of the prospectus may be
resumed, and has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings
incorporated by reference in the prospectus.

Section 2.05. _Cooperation by Holders_. The Partnership shall have no
obligation to include in a Registration Statement, or in an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_, Registrable Securities of a Selling
Holder who has failed to timely furnish such information that the Partnership
determines, after consultation with counsel, is reasonably required in order
for the Registration Statement or prospectus supplement, as applicable, to
comply with the Securities Act.

 

Section 2.06. _Expenses_. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration
Expenses, including in the case of an Underwritten Offering, regardless of
whether any sale is made in such Underwritten Offering. Each Selling Holder
shall pay all Selling Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable
Securities hereunder. In addition, except as otherwise provided in  _Section
2.07_, the Partnership shall not be responsible for legal fees incurred by
Holders in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



7 Section 2.07. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _By the Partnership_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder participating
therein, its directors, officers, employees and agents, and each Person, if
any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and its
directors, officers, employees or agents, against any losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint or several, to which such Selling Holder,
director, officer, employee, agent or controlling Person may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus or any Written
Testing-the-Waters Communication, in the light of the circumstances under
which such statement is made) contained in any Written Testing-the-Waters
Communication, a Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus or
prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final prospectus or
prospectus supplement contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or any Written
Testing-the-Waters Communication, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling
Holder, its directors, officers, employee and agents, and each such
controlling Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them
in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings as such expenses are incurred; _provided, however_ , that the
Partnership will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any
such Loss arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission so made in conformity with
information furnished by such Selling Holder, its directors, officers,
employees and agents or such controlling Person in writing specifically for
use in any Written Testing-the-Waters Communication, a Registration
Statement, or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, as
applicable. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder or any such
directors, officers, employees agents or controlling Person, and shall survive
the transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder.

 

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and not
jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, its directors,
officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the
Partnership within the meaning of the Securities Act or of the Exchange Act,
and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling Holders, but only
with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder furnished in writing
by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for inclusion in any Written
Testing-the-Waters Communication, a Registration Statement, any preliminary
prospectus or prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof; _provided, however_ , that the liability of each Selling
Holder shall not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds
(net of any Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of
the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

 



8 __(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party
from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party other than under
this _Section 2.07_. In any action brought against any indemnified party, the
indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement
thereof. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to
the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice
from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to
assume and undertake the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under this _Section 2.07_ for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and of
liaison with counsel so selected; _provided, however_ , that, (i) if the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party or (ii) if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and counsel to the indemnified party shall have concluded that there may be
reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different from
or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or if the
interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with
the interests of the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have
the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such legal defense and
otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the reasonable
expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other reasonable expenses
related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
indemnified party shall settle any action brought against it with respect to
which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent of the
indemnifying party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or
obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnifying party. __

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.07_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on
the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with
the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall the Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph
were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take account of the equitable 

 



9  considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party
as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of  _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.07_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

Section 2.08. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Partnership agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) make and keep public information regarding the Partnership available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
at all times from and after the date hereof;

(b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Partnership under the Exchange Act at all times from
and after the date hereof; and

 

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, unless otherwise
available via EDGAR, furnish to such Holder forthwith upon request a copy of
the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Partnership, and such other
reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such
Holder to sell any such securities without registration.

Section 2.09. _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted to a Holder
by the Partnership under this _Article II_ may be transferred or assigned by
such Holder to one or more transferee(s) or assignee(s) of such Registrable
Securities;  _provided, however_ , that (a) unless such transferee or
assignee is an Affiliate of MLP Holdco, each such transferee or assignee holds
Registrable Securities representing at least five percent (5%) of the then-
outstanding Registrable Securities (subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 3.04_), (b) the Partnership is given written notice prior to any
said transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of each such
transferee and identifying the Registrable Securities with respect to which
such registration rights are being transferred or assigned, and (c) each such
transferee agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10. _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. MLP Holdco and any other Holder(s) who, along with its
Affiliates, holds at least five percent (5%) of the then-outstanding
Registrable Securities (subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 3.04_),
agrees to enter into a customary letter agreement with underwriters providing
such Holder will not effect any public sale or distribution of the
Registrable Securities during the 90 calendar day period beginning on the date
of a prospectus or prospectus supplement filed with the

 



10  Commission with respect to the pricing of an Underwritten Offering, provided
that (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall be no longer than
the duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed by the
underwriters on the Partnership or the officers, directors or any other
unitholder of the Partnership on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 2.10_ shall not apply to any
Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such
Holder.

appropriately adjusted for combinations, splits, recapitalizations, pro rata
distributions and the like occurring after the date of this Agreement.

Section 3.05. _Specific Performance_. Damages in the event of breach of this

without limiting any other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to

other rights and remedies at law or in equity that such party may have.

counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be

the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees (i) that it
is and shall continue to be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of Delaware and of the federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware,

notify the other parties hereto of the name and address of such agent, and
(B) to the fullest extent permitted by law, that service of process may also
be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing
receipt validated by the U.S. Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service, and that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service
made pursuant to (ii)(A) or (B) above shall have the same legal force and
effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
be considered an original but which together shall be deemed one and the same
instrument. An executed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email
or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same

enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect
of the subject matter contained herein. Except as provided in the Partnership

understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 3.11. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended only by means of a
written amendment signed by the Partnership and the Holders of a majority of
the then outstanding Registrable Securities; _provided, however_ , that no
such amendment shall materially and adversely affect the rights of any Holder
hereunder without the consent of such Holder.

Section 3.12. _No Presumption_. If any claim is made by a party relating to
any conflict, omission, or ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption or
burden of proof or persuasion shall be implied by virtue of the fact that this
Agreement was prepared by or at the request of a particular party or its
counsel.

Securities held or acquired by Persons who are Affiliates of one another
shall be aggregated together for the purpose of determining the availability
