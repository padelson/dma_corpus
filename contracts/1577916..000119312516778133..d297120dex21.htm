other time or location as the Seller and the Purchaser shall mutually agree,
and the Closing shall be deemed to occur at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on the

time as provided herein.

2.1 _Estimated Closing Date Payment_. For purposes hereof, " _ _Estimated
Closing Date Payment__ " shall mean an amount equal to (a) Three Hundred
Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($325,000,000), (b) _minus_ the amount of

calculations set forth in clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above shall be
taken without duplication of any items in two or more of such clauses.

2.2 _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. Within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to _Section
2.3_:

(a) if the Estimated Closing Date Payment as finally determined and set forth
on the Final Closing Statement (the " _ _Final Closing Date Payment__ ") is
less than the Estimated Closing Date Payment as set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement (the amount of

 



2  such shortfall, the " _ _Shortfall__ "), then the Seller shall pay to the
Purchaser an amount equal to the Shortfall by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account that the Purchaser shall have designated at
least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time for payment specified
hereunder; or

(b) if the Final Closing Date Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing
Date Payment as set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement (the amount of
such excess, the " _ _Excess__ "), then Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an
amount equal to the Excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account of the Seller as specified by the Seller at least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to the time for payment specified hereunder.

 

2.3 _Determination of Net Working Capital_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Seller shall have delivered to the Purchaser a statement
(the " _ _Estimated Closing Statement__ ") setting forth the Sellers
reasonable and good faith best estimate, determined on a pro forma basis as of
the Closing Date, of (i) the amount of Indebtedness of the Company Parties as
of the Closing Date, (ii) the amount of Cash of the Company Parties as of the
Closing Date, (iii) the amount of Company Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing Date; (iv) an unaudited statement setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the amounts of Adjusted Current Assets and Adjusted Current
Liabilities as of the Closing Date and the resulting Net Working Capital as of
the Closing Date and the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital as
reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement is greater than or less than the
Working Capital Target; and (v) the resulting Estimated Closing Date Payment
in accordance with _Section 2.1_. The amounts and calculations set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement shall be determined in accordance with the
applicable provisions and definitions herein and the calculation of the
estimated Net Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Methods.

 

(b) _Preliminary Closing Statement_. Within sixty (60) calendar days after the
Closing Date, the Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver
to the Purchaser a statement (the " _ _Preliminary Closing Statement__ ")
setting forth the Sellers good faith determinations of (i) the amount of
Indebtedness of the Company Parties as of the Closing Date, (ii) the amount
of Cash of the Company Parties as of the Closing Date, (iii) the amount of
Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date, (iv) an unaudited
statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, the amounts of Adjusted
Current Assets and Adjusted Current Liabilities as of the Closing Date and the
resulting Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date and the amount, if any,
by which the Net Working Capital as reflected on the Preliminary
Closing Statement is greater than or less than the Working Capital Target,
and (v) a resulting recalculation of the Estimated Closing Date Payment in
accordance with _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.3(a)_.

 

(c) _Objection to Preliminary Closing Statement_. Within forty-five (45)
calendar days after the Preliminary Closing Statement is delivered to the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, the Purchaser shall complete its
review of the items set forth on the Preliminary Closing Statement. If the
Purchaser objects to the calculation of Net Working Capital, Indebtedness of
the Company Parties, Cash of the Company Parties or Company Transaction
Expenses as set forth in the Preliminary Closing Statement, then the Purchaser
shall inform the

 



3  Seller on or prior to the last day of such forty-five (45) calendar day
period by delivering a written notice to the Seller (a " _ _Closing Statement
Objection__ ") setting forth a specific description of the basis of the
Closing Statement Objection and the adjustments to such items that the
Purchaser believes should be made. If no Closing Statement Objection is
delivered to the Seller within such forty-five (45) calendar day period, then
the Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Preliminary Closing
Statement and such Preliminary Closing Statement shall constitute the Final
Closing Statement.

 

(d) _Response to Closing Statement Objection_. If a Closing Statement
Objection is delivered to the Seller pursuant to  _Section 2.3(c)_, then the
Seller shall have fifteen (15) calendar days to review and respond to the
Closing Statement Objection by delivering written notice to the Purchaser,
specifying the scope of its disagreement with the information contained in
the Closing Statement Objection. If no such written notice is delivered to the
Purchaser within such fifteen (15) calendar day period, then the Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement Objection and the
Preliminary Closing Statement delivered by the Seller as adjusted and modified
by the Closing Statement Objection shall constitute the Final Closing
Statement.

 

(e) _Dispute Resolution Following Closing Statement Objection_.

 

(i) _Negotiation_. If the Seller delivers a written notice to the Purchaser in
response to a Closing Statement Objection pursuant to  _Section 2.3(d)_,
then the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly meet and attempt in good
faith to resolve only those items which have been raised in the Closing
Statement Objection and where Purchaser and Seller have yet to agree (the " _
_Closing Statement Dispute__ ").

(ii) _Resolution by Accounting Firm_. If the Seller and the Purchaser
are unable to resolve the Closing Statement Dispute within thirty (30)
calendar days after the delivery of a Closing Statement Objection to the
Seller, then at any time thereafter the Seller or the Purchaser may elect to
have the Closing Statement Dispute resolved by a nationally recognized firm
of independent public accountants reasonably acceptable to both the Seller and
the Purchaser (the " _ _Accounting Firm__ "), who shall, acting as experts and
not as arbitrators, and only with respect to amounts remaining in dispute
following such thirty (30) calendar day period that are submitted to the
Accounting Firm, determine whether and to what extent, if any, the
Indebtedness of the Company Parties, the Cash of the Company Parties, the
Company Transaction Expenses and the Net Working Capital as derived from the
Preliminary Closing Statement requires adjustment. In connection with the
engagement of the Accounting Firm, each party shall execute
reasonable engagement letters in the reasonable discretion of the respective
parties and supply such other documents and information as the Accounting Firm
reasonably requires. Except to the extent oral presentations are reasonably
requested by the Accounting Firm, at which presentation a representative of
the other party hereto shall be entitled to attend, the determination by the
Accounting Firm of the amounts in dispute shall be based solely on written
submissions by the Purchaser and the Seller, with a copy to the other party.
The determination by the Accounting Firm of the amounts in dispute shall not
involve the Accounting Firms independent review. Without limitation, each
party may submit such additional data and information to the Accounting Firm
as the Accounting Firm reasonably requests. Neither the Purchaser nor the
Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates, accountants, auditors and
other 

 



4  representatives shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the
Accounting Firm regarding the subject matter hereof without the other partys
prior written consent. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to perform its services within thirty (30) calendar days
after submission of the Closing Statement Dispute to it and, in any case, as
soon as practicable after such submission. In resolving the Closing Statement
Dispute, the Accounting Firm (A) shall base its determination upon the
Accounting Methods and terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (B) shall
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by the Purchaser or the Seller, or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by the Purchaser or the Seller, as presented to the
Accounting Firm pursuant hereto. The determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be set forth in a written report (including sufficient explanation for
the basis of each decision), shall be final and binding on the parties hereto
and shall not be subject to dispute, appeal, litigation or challenge for any
reason (other than in the event of manifest error). Judgment may be entered
to enforce such determination set forth in the Accounting Firms report in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(iii) _Payment of Fees of Accounting Firm_. The Purchaser and the Seller will
each be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination
of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

 

(f) _Cooperation_. Each party agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, it
will not, and it will cause its Affiliates to not, take any actions with
respect to the accounting books, records, policies and procedures of the
Company Parties that would be reasonably expected to obstruct or prevent the
preparation, review or evaluation of the Preliminary Closing Statement. Each
party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and designees to
cooperate, with the other in the preparation, review and evaluation of the
Preliminary Closing Statement, including the provision on a timely basis of
access to its financial records, accounting personnel, advisers and all
information reasonably necessary or useful in connection with the preparation,
review and evaluation of the Preliminary Closing Statement. The Purchaser and
its accountants shall have reasonable access to all relevant information,
including, without limitation, all information used by the Seller in preparing
the Estimated Closing Statement and the Preliminary Closing Statement,
including the work papers of its accountants, but only to the extent
that such work papers relate to items in the Estimated Closing Statement. The
Seller and its accountants shall have reasonable access to all relevant
information, including, without limitation, all information used by the
Purchaser in preparing the Closing Statement Objection, including the work
papers of its accountants, but only to the extent that such work papers relate
to items in the Closing Statement Objection. Any such access shall be given in
such a manner as to maintain the confidentiality of any confidential
information, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and so as
not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of each party or any of its
Affiliates.

 



5 2.4 _Earn-Out_.

 

(a) Subsequent to the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, an
amount of cash (the " _ _Earn-Out Amount__ ") equal to:

(i) $18,500,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) is
greater than or equal to $60,100,000, but less than $62,600,000 during the
period from July 1, 2016 through and including June 30, 2017 (the " _ _Earn-
Out Period__ ");

 

(ii) $21,125,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or
equal to $62,600,000, but less than $65,300,000 during the Earn-Out Period;

(iii) $26,750,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or
equal to $65,300,000, but less than $67,500,000 during the Earn-Out Period;

(iv) $32,375,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or
equal to $67,500,000, but less than $69,700,000 during the Earn-Out Period;

(v) $38,000,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or
equal to $69,700,000, but less than $73,100,000 during the Earn-Out Period; or

(vi) $43,000,000, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or
equal to $73,100,000 during the Earn-Out Period;

_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate Earn-Out Amount
received by the Seller exceed Forty-Three Million Dollars ($43,000,000). For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA during the
Earn-Out Period is less than $60,100,000, the Earn-Out Amount for the Earn-
Out Period shall be zero.

(b) Within ten (10) days after the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA for the
Earn-Out Period has been determined conclusively by the Purchaser and the
Seller in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_, the Purchaser shall pay to Seller
the Earn-Out Amount (the " _ _Earn-Out Payment__ ") as set forth in  _Section
2.4(a)_. The Earn-Out Payment shall not be subject to set off against any
other amounts whatsoever, counterclaims or otherwise, including any amounts
payable by the Seller to Buyer hereunder or pursuant to any other
Transaction Document. If the Earn-Out Payment is not paid in full within
three (3) Business Days after the date when it is due and payable hereunder,
the full amount of the Earn-Out Payment shall bear interest at the Default
Rate from such due date until the payment in full of the Earn-Out Payment and
all accrued interest.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA" shall
mean, with respect to the Earn-Out Period, the Company Parties net income (or
loss) as calculated in accordance with the Accounting Methods and as adjusted
pursuant to the adjustments described on _Exhibit A_  attached hereto;
provided that, in the event of a conflict between the Accounting Methods and
the principles set forth on _Exhibit A_ , the principles set forth on _Exhibit
A_ shall control. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to contrary
herein, but subject to the Accounting Methods and the adjustments described on
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto, for purposes of calculating the Company Parties
Adjusted EBITDA with respect to the Earn-Out Period:

 

(i) the Purchaser shall exclude all costs or expenses that are incurred by the
Company Parties:

 

A) unless costs or expenses for such activities or reasonably similar
activities were incurred by the Company Parties in the ordinary course of
business prior to the Closing in comparable aggregate or individual amounts;

 



6 B) as a result of any allocation to the Business by the Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including any allocation of corporate-level overhead of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates for human resources, legal, accounting, corporate
communications or any other costs or expenses; or

 

C) that are incurred in relation to or as a result of the Transactions
(including all costs and expenses incurred in contemplation of
such Transactions and costs and expenses incurred after the Closing related
to implementing the Transactions, including any costs and expenses of the
Company Parties under the Transition Services Agreement (other than the
aggregate "Service Fees", as defined in the Transition Services Agreement)),
unless such cost or expense is approved in writing by the Seller.

(ii) the Purchaser shall include any new revenues of the Company Parties
during the Earn-Out Period as a result of growth of the Business in the
ordinary course of business by the Company Parties only, including revenue
associated with any addition of participating members due to acquisitions of
any third party group purchasing organization by the Company Parties;
_provided_ _that_ , new revenue from the addition of participating members
that were participating members of any acquired organizations shall only be
included in the determination of the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA to the
extent such revenue is in excess of a baseline level of revenue attributable
to such members or organizations for the 12 month period prior to such
addition or acquisition, which baseline level shall be determined on a
reasonable basis and mutually agreed, and if not mutually agreed, determined
on the basis of the annualized revenue attributable to such members or
organizations, as applicable, for such period; _provided_ , _that_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, revenue of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (other than
Company Parties) shall not be included in the calculation.

 

(iii) the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA shall also include all revenues
generated from administrative fees with respect to non-acute affiliates of
United Iroquois Shared Services listed on _Schedule 2.4(c)(iii)_
(collectively, the " _ _UISS Transferred Entities__ ") that would have been
recorded by a Company Party for the period prior to and during the Earn-Out
Period had such UISS Transferred Entities been rostered to a Company Party
(rather than to Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company Parties)). To
the extent a UISS Transferred Entity has not been rostered to a Company Party
prior to the Closing Date, the Seller and its Affiliates shall cooperate with
the Purchaser and the Company Parties to aid the Purchaser in rostering such
UISS Transferred Entity to the appropriate Company Party as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date. To the extent that Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company Parties) prior to the Closing Date,
collected or recognized, or after the Closing Date, collect or recognize,
revenue generated from administrative fees with respect to a UISS Transferred
Entity with respect to the Earn-Out Period, Seller shall remit to the
Purchaser an amount equal to such revenue as soon as practicable thereafter;

 



7 (iv) it is expected that members of the Company Parties management will spend
a reasonable amount of business time assisting the Purchaser and its
Affiliates with planning for integration of the Company Parties into the
Purchaser and its Affiliates and identifying synergies related thereto, and
the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA shall not be adjusted to reflect an
allocation of compensation for such assistance by members of the Company
Parties management, provided that the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA shall
be increased by the travel costs and expenses related thereto;

(d) Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the end of the Earn-Out
Period, but in no event less than ninety (90) days after the end of the Earn-
Out Period, the Seller will prepare in good faith and submit to the Purchaser
a statement (the " _ _EBITDA Statement__ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
the Sellers calculation of the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA for the
Earn-Out Period in accordance with _Section 2.4(c)_. Upon receipt of the
EBITDA Statement, the Purchaser and its accountants will be given reasonable
access upon reasonable notice to the Sellers relevant books, records,
workpapers and personnel during business hours for the purpose of verifying
the Sellers determination of the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA. Any such
access shall be given in such a manner as to maintain the confidentiality of
any confidential information, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and so as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of each
party or any of its Affiliates. If the Purchaser has no objections in respect
of the EBITDA Statement, the Purchaser may notify the Seller of its acceptance
in writing any time within thirty (30) days after receiving the EBITDA
Statement and this will be deemed the Purchasers acceptance of the Sellers
calculation as set forth in the EBITDA Statement. If the Purchaser has any
objections in respect the EBITDA Statement, the Purchaser will notify the
Seller in writing of its objections within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof and will set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail, the reasons
for the Purchasers objections. If the Purchaser fails to deliver its notice
of objections within thirty (30) days after receipt of the EBITDA Statement,
the Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted the Sellers calculation as set
forth in the EBITDA Statement. If the Purchaser delivers a notice of
objections within such thirty (30) day period, the Purchaser and the Seller
will endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters within (30) days
after receipt of the Purchasers notice of objections. If the Purchaser and
the Seller are unable to resolve the dispute regarding the Company Parties
Adjusted EBITDA (the " _ _Companies EBITDA Dispute__ ") within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Purchasers notice of objections, then at any time
thereafter the Purchaser or the Seller may elect to have the Companies EBITDA
Dispute resolved by the Accounting Firm, who shall, acting as experts and not
as arbitrators, and only with respect to amounts that remain in dispute
following such thirty (30) day period that are submitted to the Accounting
Firm, determine the amount of the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA for the
Earn-Out Period. In connection with the engagement of the Accounting Firm,
each party shall execute reasonable engagement letters in the reasonable
discretion of the respective parties and supply such other documents and
information as the Accounting Firm reasonably requires. Except to the extent
oral presentations are reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, at which
presentation a representative of the other party hereto shall be entitled to
attend, the determination by the Accounting Firm of the amounts in dispute
shall be based solely on written submissions by the Seller and the Purchaser,
with a copy to the other party. The determination

 



8  by the Accounting Firm of the amounts in dispute shall not involve the
Accounting Firms independent review. Without limitation, each party may
submit such additional data and information to the Accounting Firm as the
Accounting Firm reasonably requests. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, accountants, auditors and other
representatives shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the
Accounting Firm regarding the subject matter hereof without the other partys
prior written consent. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to perform its services within thirty (30) calendar days
after submission of the Companies EBITDA Dispute to it and, in any case, as
soon as practicable after such submission. In resolving the Companies EBITDA
Dispute, the Accounting Firm (A) shall base its determination upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to the provisions of
this _Section 2.4_, and (B) shall not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by the Seller or the Purchaser, or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Seller or the
Purchaser, as presented to the Accounting Firm pursuant hereto. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be set forth in a written report
(including sufficient explanation for the basis of each decision), shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto and shall not be subject to dispute,
appeal, litigation or challenge for any reason (other than in the event of
manifest error). Judgment may be entered to enforce such determination set
forth in the Accounting Firms report in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The Seller and the Purchaser will each be responsible for the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
the matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation
shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values
of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at
the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
the Seller and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that:

(i) for purposes of enabling the Seller to achieve an Earn-Out Payment,
throughout the Earn-Out Period, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company Parties, as applicable, to (A) operate the Business as a separate
division on a standalone basis in the ordinary course, consistent with past
practice, except (I) as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement,
(II) as expressly contemplated by this _Section 2.4_, and (III) to the extent
that an action or omission by a Company Party would be a violation of
applicable Law with respect to any Company Party or any Affiliate thereof; (B)
use reasonable efforts to maintain true, complete, accurate and separate
accounting records (from the Purchaser and its other Affiliates) in order
to accurately calculate the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of
this _Section 2.4_, and which it shall make available for review, until the
Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA for the Earn-Out Period is
determined conclusively in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_, by the Seller
and its representatives upon reasonable notice; (C) provide the current
members of the Company Parties senior management with the authority to manage
the ordinary course business and affairs of the Company Parties, including
the general authority to make all material decisions pertaining to the
ordinary course of the operation of the Company Parties (which ordinary course
operation shall not include, among other actions, (x) material changes in the
strategic direction of the Business, (y) acquisitions or dispositions of
material assets outside the ordinary course of business, or (z) net increases
or decreases in headcount of more than nine (9) individuals (excluding the
effect of resignations, other than constructive

 



9  discharges) unless the Company Parties senior management failed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to fill the resulting vacancy in a timely
manner); (D) consult with the Seller prior to taking any material action over
which the Company Parties senior management would not have authority pursuant
to clause (C); (E) refrain from taking actions, the primary purpose of which
is to, or are intended to, diminish the amount of the Earn-Out Payment,
including postponing to any periods following the Earn-Out Period any revenues
that would otherwise be expected to occur during the Earn-Out Period or
accelerating to any periods prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Period
any costs or expenses that would otherwise be expected to occur, or that
otherwise relate to the period, after the expiration of the Earn-Out Period;
and (F) consult with the Seller prior to taking any material action that
would reasonably be expected to diminish the amount of the Earn-Out Payment,
including postponing to any periods following the Earn-Out Period any revenues
that would otherwise be expected to occur during the Earn-Out Period or
accelerating to any periods prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Period
any costs or expenses that would otherwise be expected to occur, or that
otherwise relate to the period, after the expiration of the Earn-Out Period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the Seller opposes the taking of,
and the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Company Parties nevertheless
takes, any such action described in clause (D) or clause (F), the Purchaser
and the Seller shall work together in good faith to determine an appropriate
adjustment to the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the effect of
such action described in clause (D) or (F), as the case may be, and in no
event shall the Seller shall have the right or ability or be entitled to, and
the Seller hereby waives its right to, enjoin the taking of such action,
whether by a decree of specific performance or any temporary, preliminary or
permanent injunctive relief. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Purchaser,
its Affiliates or any of the Company Parties, incur a cost or expense that is
to be excluded from the calculation of Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA by
_Section 2.4(c)(i)_ (including a cost or expense contemplated by clause (E)
above or clause (D) or (F) above that is not approved by the Seller), the
Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of the Company Parties may incur such
restricted cost or expense so long as all amounts related thereto are excluded
from the calculation of the Company Parties Adjusted EBITDA; and

(ii) the possibility of receiving the Earn-Out Payment comprises a material
inducement for the Seller to enter into this Agreement; provided, however, the
Seller acknowledges that the Earn-Out Payment is speculative in nature, is
subject to numerous factors outside the control of the Purchaser, there is
no assurance that the Seller will receive any Earn-Out Payment and the
Purchaser has neither promised nor projected any Earn-Out Payment.

 

(f) For purposes of enabling the Seller to achieve an Earn-Out Payment, during
the Earn-Out Period, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to
promptly apply an appropriate credit for commissions and fees payable to the
Company Parties in respect of group purchasing services performed by the
Company Parties in conjunction with the Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant
to and consistent with the terms of the underlying agreements regarding such
group purchasing services.

2.5 _Retention Bonus Payment_. In the event that (a) the Company Parties
Adjusted EBITDA (as conclusively determined in accordance with _Section
2.4(d)_) is greater than or equal to Sixty Million One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($60,100,000), (b) it has been finally determined that any employee
identified on _Schedule 2.5_ is required under his or her

 



10  Employment Agreement (as in effect as of the Closing and as set forth on
_Exhibit C_ ) to be paid a Retention Bonus Payment (as defined in such
Employment Agreement), and (c) such Retention Bonus Payment is paid to such
employee, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount of cash equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of such Retention Bonus Payment within five (5)
Business Days after receipt by the Seller from the Purchaser of written
notice of and evidence that such Retention Bonus Payment has been fully and
finally paid to any such employee; provided that in no event shall the
aggregate amount of the Retention Bonus Payment paid by the Seller
pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

3\. _Representations and Warranties Regarding the Company Parties_.

retire any membership interests or equity interests of the Companies or any

Transfer Taxes are payable. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest
extent possible under such Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Tax payable
in connection with the transactions described herein.

(b) _Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

(i) The parties hereto recognize that for federal income tax purposes the
Purchasers purchase of the Innovatix Interests will be treated by Purchaser
as a purchase of the assets of Innovatix and by the Seller as a sale of the
Innovatix Interests, in accordance with IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6 (Situation 1)
and that, as a result, the taxable year of Innovatix will end for
federal income tax purposes as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

purchase of the Essensa Interests will be treated by the Purchaser as a
purchase of the assets of Essensa and by the Seller as a sale of the assets

of any Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Companies for

filed until Seller has had such an opportunity to comment. All such Pre-
Closing Returns shall be prepared consistent with past practice except as
otherwise required by Law. The Seller shall cooperate reasonably with the
Company Parties, to the extent reasonably necessary, in the preparation of
such Pre-Closing Returns, including by making the Company Parties book and
records available for inspection by the Company Parties, the Company Parties
accountants, auditors and attorneys upon reasonable advance notice. Except to
the extent specifically reflected as an Adjusted Current Liability in the

Taxes payable by or on behalf of Innovatix and the Subsidiaries with respect
to the Pre-Closing Returns.

income Taxes or Taxes based on transaction, receipts or payroll, based on an
interim closing of the books of the Company Parties as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, by prorating

through and including the Closing Date to (B) the total number of days in the
tax period.

faith to allocate the Purchase Price, as finally determined, increased by the
liabilities of the Company Parties and other relevant items, among the assets
of the Company Parties in 

 



36  accordance with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code. If, within
ninety (90) days after the final determination of the Purchase Price, the
Purchaser and the Seller agree as to the allocation of the Purchase Price,
the Purchaser and the Seller further agree to prepare and file all Tax Returns
in a manner consistent with the agreed allocation and shall not take any
position inconsistent with the agreed allocation or agree to any proposed
adjustment thereto by any taxing authority without first giving the other
party prior written notice of such proposed adjustment. If, within ninety (90)
days after the final determination of the Purchase Price, the Purchaser
and the Seller are unable to resolve any disputes relating to the allocation
of the purchase price, (i) the Purchaser and the Seller may each use a
different purchase price allocation, (ii) each of the Purchaser and the Seller
shall use (and cause its Affiliates to use) their respective purchase price
allocation in connection with the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns,
and (iii) the Purchaser shall have no liability to the Seller, and the Seller
shall have no liability to the Purchaser, for any additional Taxes that may
be imposed by any Governmental Authority to the extent that such Tax arises
solely as a result of the inconsistencies between the separately used purchase
price allocations; provided, however, that the Purchaser and the Seller agree
to allocate the Purchase Price, as finally determined, increased by the
liabilities of the Company Parties and other relevant items, among the assets
of the Company Parties as follows: (A) 80% with respect to Innovatix and its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) 20% with respect to Essensa, except with respect to
Indebtedness of the Company Parties, Cash of the Company Parties and Net
Working Capital, which shall allocated as finally determined pursuant to 
_Section 2.3_.

(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any party hereto, in

proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the

year in which the Closing occurs or the expiration of any applicable statute
of limitations, including any extensions thereof, and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event will either party be required to provide to the other
party any Tax Return, or any portion thereof, filed by a direct or indirect
parent of a Company Party (or any related records and information).

Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the Transactions).

indemnification obligation under _Section 9.2_, the Seller may elect, by
written notice to the Purchaser, to assume control of the defense of such Tax
proceeding in the name of the applicable Company Party, as appropriate,
provided the Seller has acknowledged in writing its indemnification obligation
for such item or items. Subject to _Section 7.1(h)(iii_), if the Seller so
elects, it shall be responsible for the defense of the item or items at

other in the conduct of such Tax proceeding, (ii) the Seller shall provide the
Purchaser with copies of all written materials relating to such Tax
proceeding received from the Governmental Authority, (iii) the Purchaser shall

related to such Tax proceeding, and (iv) the Seller shall not compromise or
settle such Tax proceeding without the Purchasers prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(iii) If the Seller shall elect in writing not to control the conduct of the
Tax proceeding pursuant to _Section 7.1(h)(ii)_, or otherwise fails to take
control or share control of a Tax proceeding that it is entitled to control or
share control, the Purchaser shall have the right to control such Tax
proceeding (at the Sellers expense); provided, however, that the Purchaser
shall not compromise or settle such Tax proceeding without the Sellers prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no audit or contest
relating to Internal Revenue Service Form 1065 or any similar information
return required to be filed for state or local income Tax purposes for any
period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be subject to this _Section

any Tax Attributes of the Company Parties, or with respect to the availability
on and after the Closing Date of any Tax Attributes of any Company Party. The

or arising with respect to any sale of the Company Parties (or any assets
thereof) following the Closing Date.

Closing, (i) any manager, director, employee or officer of any Company Party,
(ii) any Person that provides or provided services under the Services
Agreement to any Company Party (including GNHYA Management Corporation), and
(iii) any Affiliate, manager, director, employee or officer of any Person
described in clause (i) or (ii) (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively,
the " _Covered Parties_ "), from (x) any and all reasonable fees and costs,
retainers, court costs, transcript costs, fees of experts, witness fees,
travel expenses, duplicating, printing and binding costs, telephone charges,
postage and delivery service fees and all other reasonable disbursements or
expenses of any type or nature whatsoever reasonably incurred by a Covered
Party (including reasonable attorneys fees), and (y) any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlement
payments, awards and amounts of any type whatsoever incurred by such Covered
Party, in either case, in connection with or arising from any Indemnification
Event arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Covered Party is or
was such a manager, officer, employee, director, provider of services or
Affiliate (including the taking of any action or the failure to take any
action in such capacity in connection with the Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after Closing; _provided_ , however, in no
event shall the Purchaser or any Company Party be obligated to indemnify any
such Covered Party in the case of fraud; _provided_ ,  _further_ , however
that the indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.17(a)_ shall not apply
to any such Covered Party in connection with any claim made by the Purchaser
for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document. Each Covered Party will be entitled, subject to applicable Law, to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of or other participation in
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of
the Purchaser and the applicable Company Party within 14 days of receipt by
the Purchaser or the applicable Company Party from the Covered Party of a
request therefor; provided, that any Covered Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable Law,
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Covered Party
is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, during the period from the Closing until
the six year anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) the Purchaser shall cause
the Charters or the Operating Agreements of the Company Parties to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation no less beneficial
to the Covered Persons as set forth in the Charters or the
Operating Agreements of the Company Parties on the date hereof (unless
prohibited by applicable Law), and (ii) the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit the Company to amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Charters or
the Operating Agreements of the Company Parties relating to the exculpation
or indemnification of any Covered Person in any way that decreases or
restricts a Company Partys obligations or the Covered Persons rights
thereunder (unless required by applicable Law), it being the intent of the
parties hereto that the Covered Persons shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the applicable Law.

 

(c) In the event that after the Closing Date, the Purchaser or any Company
Party, or their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any 

 



53  Person, then, and in each case, reasonable and proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser or the Company Party,
as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations of such
Persons (to the extent allowed by applicable Law), including under this _
Section 7.17_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _ Section 7.17_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person.

7.18 _Access to Agreements_. To the extent that members of the Company Parties
benefit, directly or indirectly, from contracts in the portfolio of group
purchasing contracts for goods, services and materials that have been
negotiated by the Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit of the members of
the Company Parties, including enhancement agreements available to such
members of the Company Parties under the national group purchasing contracts
negotiated by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for the benefit of
members of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (the " _ _Premier
Program Contracts__ "), the Seller and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transition responsibility therefor to the Purchaser and
its Affiliates and the members of the Company Parties shall retain the right
to benefit therefrom until such time as the transition is completed.

7.19 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 7.1(e)_, at any time and from
time to time after the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall (a) furnish upon
reasonable request to each other such information, documents, instruments of
transfer or assignment, files and books and records, (b) promptly execute,
acknowledge, and deliver any such documents, instruments of transfer or
assignment, files and books and records, and (c) do all such further acts and
things, as such other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying
out the intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein.

8\. _Termination._

 

8.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions may be abandoned at any time
before the Closing occurs:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Seller;

 

(b) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Order or taken any other action (which Order or other action of the
parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to lift), in each case
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions
or making the Transactions illegal and such Order shall have become final
and non-appealable;

(c) by the Seller, if the Seller is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a material violation or breach by the
Purchaser of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of the Seller at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by the Seller or cured by the Purchaser within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by the Purchaser of written notice thereof by the Seller;

 



54 (d) by the Purchaser, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement and there has been a material violation or breach by the
Seller or any Company Party of any covenant, agreement, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of
any condition to the obligations of the Purchaser at the Closing and such
violation or breach has not been waived by the Purchaser or cured by the
Seller or such Company Party within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by
the Seller of written notice thereof from the Purchaser; or 

(e) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if the Transactions have not been
consummated on or prior to January 31, 2017; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall not
be available to (i) the Seller, if the action or failure to act of the Seller
or a Company Party has been a principal cause of or resulted in, or (ii) the
Purchaser, if the action or failure to act of the Purchaser has been a
principal cause of or resulted in, the failure of the Transactions to occur on
or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of
this Agreement.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in  _Section 8.1_ hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith
be given to the other party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void, and there shall be no liability on the part of the Purchaser, the
Seller or the Company Parties (nor any of their respective officers,
directors, managers, stockholders, members, employees, representatives or
Affiliates), except for liabilities for Intentional Misrepresentation, any
willful breaches of this Agreement or fraud prior to such termination;
provided, that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ and _Section
11_ hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement; and provided
further that the confidentiality provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect. A partys right to terminate this
Agreement is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other legal or
equitable rights or remedies which such party may have.

9\. _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification_.

 

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except as otherwise set
forth in this _Section 9.1_, all of the representations and warranties of
the Seller and the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement, schedule or certificate delivered by the Seller, a Company Party or
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Employment
Agreements, the Consulting Agreements and the Transition Services Agreement)
shall survive for eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. If a party
hereto determines that there has been a breach by the other party hereto of
any such representation or warranty and notifies the breaching party in
writing prior to the expiration of the survival period applicable to such
representation and warranty (which notice shall identify the nature of such
claim with reasonable specificity and such partys reasonable estimate of the
value of such claim), such representation or warranty and liability therefor
shall survive, but only with respect to the specified breach which is
specified in such notice, until such breach has been resolved, but no party
shall have any liability after such eighteen (18)-month period for any alleged
breaches of representations and warranties not specifically specified in a
writing delivered within such eighteen (18)-month period. Notwithstanding any
term in this _Section 9.1_, (a) claims related to any Intentional
Misrepresentation or fraud by the Seller or the Purchaser in connection with
this

 



55  Agreement and the Transactions shall survive until the date the respective

_3.5(a) (Authority for Agreement)_ , _Section 3.22 (Brokers or Agents)_, _4.1
(Ownership of Membership Interests)_ , _4.2 (Organization and Standing;
Authority)_ , _4.7 (Brokers or Agents)_, _5.1 (Organization and Authority)_
and _5.8 (Brokers or Agents)_ shall survive indefinitely (collectively, the "

warranties contained in _Section 3.19 (Taxes)_ shall survive until the date
the applicable statute of limitations for such item expires.

successors and permitted assigns (the " _ _Purchaser Indemnified Parties__ ")
and save and hold each of them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of
or reimburse the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as and when incurred for any
and all liabilities, obligations, demands, claims, Actions, causes of action,
assessments, judgments, losses, costs, damages, deficiencies, taxes, fines or
expenses (whether or not arising out of third party claims), including,
without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees and all
reasonable amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the
foregoing (collectively, " _ _Damages__ "), which any Purchaser Indemnified
Party may suffer or incur to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Seller in _Section 3_ or  _Section 4_ of this Agreement or
in any schedule or certificate delivered or to be delivered by or on behalf of
the Seller or a Company Party to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;

 

(ii) any nonfulfillment, breach or violation of any covenant or agreement on
the part of the Seller or a Company Party (at or prior to Closing) under this
Agreement;

(iii) any Indemnified Taxes;

 

(iv) any fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Seller or the Company
Parties prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Transactions in
excess of the amount of the Company Transaction Expenses used in calculating
the adjustments to the Purchase Price;

(v) any Indebtedness of the Company Parties as of the Closing Date in excess
of the amount of Indebtedness of the Company Parties used in calculating the
adjustments to the Purchase Price; and

 

(vi) the items listed on _Schedule EBP_.

 



56 (b) _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in this  _Section 9_, from and at all times after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller, its Affiliates and their

agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the " _ _Seller
Indemnified Parties__ ") and save and hold each of them harmless from and
against and pay on behalf of or reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties as
and when incurred for any and all Damages which any Seller Indemnified Party
may suffer or incur to the extent resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser under _Section 5_ of this Agreement or in any
schedule or certificate delivered or to be delivered by or on behalf of the
Purchaser to the Seller pursuant to this Agreement; and

(ii) any nonfulfillment, breach or violation of any covenant or agreement on
the part of the Purchaser under this Agreement.

(c) _Dollar Limitations  Minimum_.

 

(i) _Seller Dollar Limitations  Minimums_. The Seller shall not be liable to
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until (1) with respect to any individual item of Damage
or related items of Damage arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances, the amount of the Damages incurred by such
Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds $25,000 (the " _ _Mini-Basket__ "), and
(2) the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified
Parties (and for which the Mini-Basket is exceeded in respect of each item
of Damages) exceeds $2,437,500 (the " _ _Basket Amount__ "), provided,
however, that, in the event that such Damages exceed the Basket Amount, the
Seller shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9,
fully indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all Damages (including
the Basket Amount) incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Mini-Basket nor the Basket Amount
shall apply to Damages arising as a result of (A) any Intentional
Misrepresentation or fraud by the Seller or a Company Party, or (B) any
misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made
in the Fundamental Representations or made in  _Section 3.19 (Taxes)_.

(ii) _Purchaser Dollar Limitations  Minimum_. The Purchaser shall not be
liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for indemnification under _Section

or related items of Damage arising out of substantially similar facts and
circumstances, the amount of the Damages incurred by such Seller Indemnified
Parties exceeds the Mini-Basket, and (2) the aggregate amount of Damages
incurred by such Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Basket Amount,
provided, however, that, in the event that such Damages exceed the Basket
Amount, the Purchaser shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 9, fully indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for all Damages
(including the Basket Amount) incurred by such Seller Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Mini-Basket nor the Basket Amount
shall apply to Damages arising as a result of (A) any Intentional
Misrepresentation or fraud by the Purchaser, or (B) any misrepresentation,
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in _Section 5.1
(Organization and Authority)_ and _Section 5.8 (Brokers or Agents)_.

(i) _Seller Dollar Limitations  Maximum._ Subject to _Section 9.2(c)(i)_,
the maximum aggregate liability of the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under this _Section 9_ shall be $32,500,000; provided, however, if
the Seller was liable in the aggregate for claims for indemnification by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this  _Section 9_ in an amount equal to
or greater than $32,500,000 and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
additional unsatisfied claims for indemnification by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under this _Section 9_ solely with respect to Damages arising out of
any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made in _Section 3.15 (Employee Benefits)_, _Section 3.26_ _ (Health Care
Regulatory Compliance_) and/or  _Section 3.27 (HIPAA and Privacy Laws)_, the
maximum aggregate liability of the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under this _Section 9_ in respect of such additional unsatisfied claims shall
be an additional $6,500,000; _provided_ , _further_ , that the maximum
aggregate liability of the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification under this _Section 9_ with
respect to Damages arising out of any matter relating to (A) any Intentional
Misrepresentation or fraud by the Seller or a Company Party, or (B) any

_Section 9_ with respect to Damages arising out of any matter relating to (A)
any Intentional Misrepresentation or fraud by the Purchaser, or (B) any

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 9_ shall not apply to any
breach or default under any of the other Transaction Documents or agreements
among the parties hereto.

(e) _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(i) _Third Party Claims_. In the event that, subsequent to the Closing, any
Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _ _Indemnified
Party__ ") receives notice of the assertion of any claim or liability or of
the commencement of any Action by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement or otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder as an
Indemnified Party (including, but not limited to any Governmental Authority)
(a " _ _Third Party Claim__ ") against such Indemnified Party, for which a
claim is to be made by an Indemnified Party under this Agreement (an " _
_Indemnifying Party__ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice
regarding such claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly after receiving
written notice or reasonably becoming aware of any such claim, and shall
not make any admissions or acceptances. The Indemnified Party shall supply
the Indemnifying Party with such information and documents as it has in its
possession regarding

 



58  such Third Party Claim, together with all pertinent information in its
possession regarding the Damages that it asserts it has suffered or incurred,
and will permit the Indemnifying Party to inspect such other records and
books in the possession of the Indemnified Party and relating to the Third
Party Claim and asserted Damages as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
request.

 

A) If any Action referred to in _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ is brought against an
Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Action, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in such Action and, to the extent that it wishes and subject to
_Section 9.2(e)(i)(B)_, to assume, conduct and control, in good faith and
at its expense, the defense of such Action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such
Action, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this _Section 9.2_ for
any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
such Action, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense of such Action, other than reasonable costs of
investigation; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in the defense of such Action and to employ counsel of its
choice for such purpose (it being understood that the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party).

 

B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) an Indemnified Party determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that the Third Party Claim
may adversely affect it or its Affiliates as a result of non-monetary relief
that the third party is seeking, (2) the Third Party Claim is in respect of a
matter involving criminal liability, (3) there is a conflict of interest that
cannot be waived and would make it inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct to have common counsel for the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, or (4) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to
such Action and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint
representation would be adverse to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise, or settle such Action as it relates to the Indemnified
Party, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of an
Action so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its
written consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

C) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not elect to conduct the
defense of the subject claim, or, within a reasonable time after notice of
any such claim from the Indemnified Party, shall fail to defend, it shall be
deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject claim, and in
such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume, conduct and
control the defense in good faith and to compromise and settle the claim in
good faith and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs,
expenses, settlement amounts or other Damages paid or incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; provided, however, that no
such compromise or settlement shall be effected without the prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Indemnifying Party if, pursuant to or as a result of such compromise or
settlement, (A) injunctive relief or specific performance would be imposed
against the Indemnifying Party, or (B) if the Indemnifying Party is also named
as a party to such claim, such compromise or settlement does not expressly
and unconditionally release the Indemnifying Party

 



59  from all liabilities and obligations to the third party claimant (without
limitation of the Indemnified Partys rights against the Indemnifying Party
hereunder) with respect to such claim, without prejudice.

D) Subject to _Section 9.2(e)(i)(E)_ below, in the event that the
Indemnifying Party does elect to conduct the defense of the subject claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have the exclusive control over
said defense and settlement of the subject claim and the Indemnified Party
will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such
assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, all at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its
expense to participate in the defense, assisted by counsel of its
own choosing, subject to the control of the defense by the Indemnifying
Party.

E) Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Indemnifying Party will not
enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend against
such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation,
(A) injunctive relief or specific performance would be imposed against the
Indemnified Party, or (B) such settlement or cessation would impose a material
amount of liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part
of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

F) Any final judgment (after the conclusion of any appeal process) entered or
settlement agreed upon in the manner provided herein shall be binding upon the
Indemnifying Party, and shall conclusively be deemed to be an obligation with
respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to prompt indemnification
hereunder to the extent otherwise within the scope of the indemnification
provisions of this _Section 9._

 

G) A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely, complete or accurate
notice as provided in this _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ will not affect the rights or
obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any party entitled to receive such notice was deprived
of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage
or was otherwise directly and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure to give timely notice.

H) This  _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ shall not apply with respect to claims for
Taxes, which shall be subject to the procedural provisions set forth in
_Section 7.1(h)._

 

(ii) _Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim
against an Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice in accordance with the requirements of _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 11.5_ promptly after becoming aware of facts which the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes would likely give rise to the basis for such claim,
which notice shall, in reasonable detail, set forth the nature and basis for
such claim, the Damages to which the Indemnified Party reasonably estimates
in good faith that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, a copy of any documents in its possession supporting such claim,
together with all pertinent information in its possession 

 



60  regarding the Damages that it asserts it has suffered or incurred, and will
permit the Indemnifying Party to inspect such other records and books in the
possession of the Indemnified Party and relating to the Third Party Claim and
asserted Damages as the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request.

(f) _Contribution_. The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not have any claim
for contribution from or against the Company Parties as a result of any
indemnification or other payments made by the Seller Indemnified Parties to
any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(i) Except with regard to indemnification for claims described in _Section
9.2(e)(i)_ hereof for which an Indemnifying Party is liable, Damages payable
by an Indemnifying Party under this _Section 9_ shall not include
consequential damages (including loss of revenue, income or profits, loss or
diminution in value of assets or securities or damages calculated
by "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other valuation
methodology), punitive damages, damages related to mental or emotional
distress, exemplary damages, special damages or other indirect or incidental
damages. Any Damages for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 9_ shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Damages constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for any Damages to the extent reflected as a
liability or reserved against on the Latest Balance Sheets or in the final
determination of Indebtedness of the Company Parties, Cash of the Company
Parties, Company Transaction Expenses or Net Working Capital.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, but subject to
all of the other limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Section
9_, the amount of any Damages suffered or incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party in respect of any claim for indemnification under _Section 9(a)(i)_ to
the extent resulting from or arising out of any misrepresentation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Seller in _Section 3_ of
this Agreement or in any schedule or certificate in respect of _Section 3_
delivered by or on behalf of the Seller or a Company Party to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement that either (a) is directly related to Innovatix or
its Subsidiaries, or (b) arises out of any misrepresentation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made in  _Section 3.14
(Compliance)_, _Section 3.15 (Employee Benefits)_ or _Section 3.16 (Labor
Matters)_ that pertain to the operations of Innovatix or its Subsidiaries and
related to Employees who provide or provided services to Innovatix or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _ _Limited Innovatix Damages__ "), shall be
calculated as follows:

 

A) until such time as Seller has incurred liability to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in respect of indemnification obligations under this 
_Section 9_ for Limited Innovatix Damages that are not Limited Innovatix
Regulatory Damages in an amount equal to $15,000,000, 100% of the amount of
such Damages shall be subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9(a)(i)_ (i.e., Damages are determined as if the Purchaser were purchasing a
one-hundred percent (100%) limited liability company membership interest in
Innovatix notwithstanding that, as of the date hereof, Purchaser owns fifty
percent (50%) limited liability company membership interests of Innovatix);
and

 



61 B) (I) after such time as Seller has incurred liability to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties in respect of indemnification obligations under this
_Section 9_ for Limited Innovatix Damages in an amount in excess of
$15,000,000, or (II) such Damages are Limited Innovatix Regulatory Damages,
50% of the amount of such Damages shall be subject to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9(a)(i)_ (i.e., for purposes of excluding Damages
suffered or incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of the fifty
percent (50%) limited liability company membership interests of Innovatix
already owned by the Purchaser).

(iii) Notwithstanding _Section 9.2(g)(ii)(B)_, and subject to all of the
other limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Section 9_, with
respect to Damages resulting from or arising out of (A) any misrepresentation,
breach or inaccuracy of Excluded Representations, or (B) any Intentional
Misrepresentation or fraud by the Seller related to Limited Innovatix Damages,
Seller shall be liable for 100% of such Damages.

 

(h) _Limitation on Damages; Mitigation_. The amount of any Damages suffered by
a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, shall be reduced by (i) any third-party insurance or other indemnification
benefits which such party or any of its representatives actually receives in
respect of or as a result of such Damages (net of all costs and expenses and
any retroactive or other premium increases incurred in connection therewith),
(ii) any amounts realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of any
indemnification, contribution or other payment by a third party, and (iii)
the amount of the net Tax benefit actually realized by the Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, or its members, Subsidiaries,
or Affiliates, as applicable, arising from the deductibility of any such

Purchaser Indemnified Parties, that any Action based on or arising out of this
Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect

Indemnified Party, or their respective successors or assigns (other than a

expenses or any other amounts that the parties have agreed to exclude pursuant
to this Agreement. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

party has been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things,

release, disclosure or announcement of or concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be issued by the Seller, a Company Party, or any Affiliate
thereof, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, or any Affiliate thereof, on the
other hand, without the advance written consent of the Purchaser and
the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, however, that the parties hereto shall be permitted to make
disclosures concerning this Agreement to their accountants, attorneys and
financial advisors, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
make disclosures concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby: (a) to prospective investors, lenders and target companies in

provided, however, that such parties are subject to confidentiality
restrictions materially equivalent to those between the parties hereto; and

Schedule, so long as its applicability to such other Section or subsection of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule is readily apparent, (ii)

given to them in this Agreement.
