 _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_   

  

 Section 2.1 _The Offer_. 

   

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) of the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day from and including the date of initial public announcement of this Agreement). The obligation of Sub to commence the Offer shall be subject only to the condition that none of the events set forth in clauses (v)(a) or (v)(b) of _Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred and be continuing (and not waived by Parent or Sub 

   ##### 

  

 

in their sole discretion), and the obligation of Sub to accept for payment,
purchase and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject
only to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent or Sub in their sole discretion
(but subject to the next sentence)) of the conditions set forth in such
_Annex A_. Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any conditions to
the Offer or change the terms of the Offer except that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Sub may not waive the condition in clause (i)
of _Annex A_ (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") or the condition in clause (ii) or
(iii) of _Annex A_ , and no change in the Offer may be made which (i)
decreases the Offer Price payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer or the minimum number of Shares
contemplated by the Minimum Condition, (iv) imposes conditions to the Offer
in addition to those set forth in _Annex A_ hereto or which otherwise
modifies the conditions set forth in such _Annex A_ or (v) amends any other
term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares. Subject to
the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Sub to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon
as practicable after the expiration of the Offer (the date of acceptance for
payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ " and the time of acceptance for payment on
the Acceptance Date, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") or (in the case of Shares
tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period) as soon as practicable
following the valid tender thereof without interest, subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law or in accordance with
Sections 3.2(i) and (j). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Sub
on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any and all Shares
that Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (b) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on the date (the " _Initial Expiration Time_ ") that is twenty (20) Business Days after the commencement of the Offer (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act). Sub may, without the consent of the Company, (i) extend the Offer on one or more occasions for any period not exceeding ten (10) Business Days for any extension, if on any then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the events set forth in _Annex A_ shall have occurred and be continuing, until such time as such event or events shall no longer exist, and (ii) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. If, at the Initial Expiration Time or subsequent expiration time related to an extension of the Offer, including an extension pursuant to this sentence, any of the conditions to the obligation of Sub to accept for payment, purchase and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer has not been satisfied (or waived in accordance with this Agreement), then, if requested by the Company, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer through such time as the Company may specify, which time shall be no later than the Termination Date; _provided_ that the Company shall not be entitled to so request such an extension if any of the conditions set forth in clause (v)(b) or (v)(c) of _Annex A_ have not then been satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than any such conditions that are not so satisfied or waived under circumstances in which the breach or breaches preventing such conditions from being satisfied may, by their nature, be cured by the Company through the exercise of its reasonable efforts for a 

   ##### 

  

 

period not greater than thirty (30) days, in which case the Company may (if
all other conditions set forth in clause (v)(b) or (v)(c) of _Annex A_ are
satisfied) request one or more extensions of the Offer pursuant to this
sentence for up to thirty (30) days in the aggregate). Nothing in this
_Section 2.1(b)_ shall affect or impair any termination rights under
_ARTICLE VIII_. 

   

 (c) If all of the conditions to the Offer are satisfied or waived, but the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the Shares, if any, held by Parent and Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (any such wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, Parent and Sub, each a " _Parent Company_ "), constitute less than the number of Shares required to consummate the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.10_ (assuming the exercise of the Top-Up Option in full), then, upon the applicable expiration time of the Offer, Sub may (and if the Company so requests Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to) provide a subsequent offering period (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act and, if applicable and to the extent permitted under such Rule 14d-11, thereafter extend such subsequent offering period. 

  

 (d) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall include the offer to purchase, form of the related letter of transmittal and form of notice of guaranteed delivery and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Offer Documents will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Parent and Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to holders of Shares, and Parent and Sub shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel any comments or communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after Parents or Subs, as the case may be, receipt of such comments or communications. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any responses to such comments or communications, and Parent and Sub shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel.

In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of Parent and subject to the terms of the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, promptly take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be so elected or appointed, including, without limitation, increasing the size of its Board of Directors and/or seeking the resignations of one or more incumbent directors. At such times, subject to _Section 2.2(c)_ and applicable Law and regulations and the rules of Nasdaq Global Market, Inc., the Company will cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute such number of members of each committee of the Companys Board of Directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Companys Board of Directors, other than any committee of the Companys Board of Directors established to take action under this Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Continuing Directors (as defined in _Section 2.2(c)_). 

  

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Companys Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.2_, including mailing to stockholders together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be elected to the Companys Board of Directors. Parent shall supply to the Company, and shall be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 2.2_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ then, until the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Companys Board of Directors to maintain at least three directors who are members of the Companys Board of Directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Global Market, Inc. (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors 

   ##### 

  

 

is reduced below three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors
shall be entitled to elect or designate a person to fill such vacancy who
shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall
designate three persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers,
employees, stockholders or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Sub, and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. The Company and the Companys Board of Directors shall promptly
take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under
this  _Section 2.2(c)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or
appointed to the Companys Board of Directors and prior to the Effective
Time, the Companys Board of Directors shall take such action as necessary so
that the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or of the
sole Continuing Director if there shall then be only one Continuing Director)
shall be required, and no further action of the Companys Board of Directors
shall be required, to (v) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the
Company, (w) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies
hereunder, (x) extend the time for performance of Parents or Subs
obligations hereunder, (y) take any action adversely affecting the rights of
the Companys stockholders, or (z) take any other action by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel and financial
advisors of their choice at the reasonable expense of the Company as
determined appropriate by the Continuing Directors for the purpose of
fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after
the Acceptance Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have received at least two
Business Days prior notice of the proposed commencement of any such action.
Following the acceptance for payment of the Shares pursuant to the Offer and
prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Sub shall take any action to
remove any Continuing Director absent cause and subject to the terms of the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Shares_. 

   

 (a) At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in trust, to a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares), sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Consideration Fund_ ") to be paid pursuant to this  _Section 3.2_ in exchange for all outstanding Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares). The Consideration Fund shall not be used for any other purposes. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof together with any required indemnity) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereof, and with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE III_ , and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share or Certificate 

   ##### 

  

 

surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange present proper
evidence of transfer and pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered,
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

   

 (c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _ARTICLE III_ , and following any net losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ , except as otherwise provided by Law. 

  

 (e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the applicable former stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any). 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied 

   ##### 

  

 

with this _ARTICLE III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in
respect thereof (if any). 

   

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this  _ARTICLE III_. 

  

 (h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (i) Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Options such amounts as Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is or may be reasonably required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 (j) Notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed that no deduction or withholding of any Israeli Income Tax shall be required or shall be made out of any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Options (except for Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSUs granted under the Israeli Equity Plan), and no amount out of such consideration is required to be withheld and transferred or shall be withheld and transferred to the ITA, in each of the following cases: 

   

 (i) Payments to holders of Shares qualifying under Income Tax Regulations (Tax Exemption for Foreign Residents on the Sale of Security) 5763-2003 in effect as of the date of this Agreement; or 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Payments to holders of Shares that are qualified residents of a jurisdiction that has a dual income tax treaty with Israel providing for an exemption in Israel from capital gains on a sale of Israeli assets. 

 

In order for a holder of Shares or Company Options to qualify under Sections
3.2(j)(i) or (ii) above, a holder of Shares or Company Options must provide
to Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent a complete and
accurate Tax Declaration in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto on which
Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will rely. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each option to purchase Shares granted under the Companys 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, the Israeli Equity Plan and the Companys 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the " _Equity Plans_ "), and options to purchase Shares granted outside a plan and outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable (any such option, whether granted under an Equity Plan or otherwise, a " _Company Option_ "), shall at the Effective Time be cancelled, and the holder of each such Company Option shall be entitled to receive from the Company, as of the Effective Time and with respect to each such Company Option, cash, without interest, equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option, multiplied by (b) the number of Shares covered by such Company Option (the aggregate amount of such cash, the " _Option Consideration_ "), with such payment to be subject to any applicable Tax withholding (in accordance with Sections 3.2(i) and (j)). For clarity, no Option Consideration shall be payable in respect of Company Options with an exercise price per share in excess of the Merger Consideration. Prior to the Initial Expiration Time and subject to the foregoing, the Company shall take all steps requested by Parent to ensure that no holder of any Company Option shall have the right to acquire any of the Surviving Corporations equity securities (or other interests in respect thereof) at any time following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) restrictions on each restricted stock award granted under the Equity Plans and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (each, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall lapse as of the Effective Time and such Restricted Stock Award shall be treated in the same manner as other Shares under _Section 3.1_, subject to applicable Tax withholding and (ii) each restricted stock unit award with respect to a Share granted under the Equity Plans and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Company RSU becoming entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to Tax withholding. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, except as set forth in _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to holders of Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSUs held in trust under the Israeli Equity Plan at the Effective Time, the Option Consideration or the Merger Consideration with respect to such Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSUs shall be paid directly to the Israeli Equity Plan trustee (the " _Trustee_ "). The Trustee shall, and the Company shall cause the Trustee to, deduct from each payment of Option Consideration or Merger Consideration (as the case may be) the applicable withholding Tax at the maximum rate required under Israeli Law and to transfer such amount to the ITA, unless the Trustee shall have received, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the last day on which the amounts so withheld must be transferred to the ITA, either (i) the Israeli Tax Ruling in a form sufficient, under applicable Law, to the Trustees satisfaction, to establish that withholding is not required or that a lower withholding rate applies;  _provided_ that the terms and conditioned of the Israeli Tax Ruling are met, or (ii) certificates or forms issued by the ITA with respect to any or all holders of a Company Option, as are sufficient, under applicable Law, to the Trustees satisfaction, to establish that withholding is not required or that a lower withholding rate applies, in which case, the Trustee shall withhold, in lieu of the maximum rate referred to above, such amounts as are consistent with such Israeli Tax Ruling, certificates or forms. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the ITA, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Options, Restricted Stock Awards or Company RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Trustee. 

  

 (d) Prior to the Initial Expiration Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain an acknowledgment from each holder of the Warrants listed on Schedule 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule which shall provide for the cancellation of all such Warrants as of the Effective Time in return for a cash payment to each such holder (promptly following the Effective Time) in an amount equal to (i) the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to the Warrants of such holder and (B) the Merger Consideration _minus_ (ii) the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to the Warrants of such holder and (B) the per share exercise price of such Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that if the foregoing calculation results in a negative number, the cash payment shall be $0). All amounts payable in respect of such Warrants pursuant to this _Section 3.3(d)_ shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest. Prior to the Initial Expiration Time and subject to the foregoing, the Company shall take all steps necessary to ensure that no holder of Warrants shall have the right to acquire any of the Surviving Corporations equity securities (or other interests in respect thereof) at any time following the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to take all such actions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ and to cause the Equity Plans and all rights thereunder (other than the right to the Option Consideration and Merger Consideration as provided herein) to be 

   ##### 

  

 

terminated effective as of the Effective Time. After the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent all
funds necessary to fulfill the obligations under this _Section 3.3_. 

   

 Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall promptly provide Parent with notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent and the aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Parent, of Sub) to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (and,
in the case of Parent, of Sub) under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_

 Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. The Company shall afford to officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, accountants and other authorized representatives (the foregoing, with respect to any Person, its " _Representatives_ ") of Parent reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive to the operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties, personnel, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to Parents Representatives all information concerning the business, properties (including Phase I environmental assessments) and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any information to Parent or Sub if such disclosure, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would (i) violate applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company is a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this  _Section 6.3_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided further_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to undertake any intrusive or subsurface Phase II environmental assessments or sampling at any of the properties owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, in the event that the Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_, the Company and its Board of Directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any information and access to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if (i) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Person is reasonably likely to submit to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its counsel, that the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such information would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ that all such information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially concurrent with it being so furnished to such Person or its Representatives. In addition, nothing herein shall restrict the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations with regard to any Acquisition Proposal under applicable Law. 

  

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so modify) the recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company and any committee thereof of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a customary confidentiality agreement) (any such agreement, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) make a Change in Recommendation if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (ii) terminate this Agreement to accept a Superior Proposal that was not solicited after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this  _Section 6.4_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no Change in Recommendation may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ may be made, in each case until after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make a Change in Recommendation (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ") or terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") and specifying the reasons therefor, 

   ##### 

  

 

including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Companys Board of
Directors is a Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new five (5) Business Day period). In determining whether
to make a Change in Recommendation, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent in response to a Notice of Adverse Recommendation, a Notice of
Superior Proposal or otherwise. 

  

 (d) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal.

 Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall, subject to any requirements imposed by local Law, cause to be provided to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are primarily employed in the United States (the " _US Employees_ ") who remain in the employment of the Surviving Corporation base salary or hourly wage rates that, on an individual-by-individual basis, are no less favorable than those provided to such US Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of each US Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i) for purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parents defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of vesting under Parents 401(k) retirement plan, (iii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under Parents vacation program, (iv) for purposes of eligibility and participation under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan) and (v) unless covered under another arrangement with or of the Company, for benefit accrual purposes under Parents severance plan (in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), solely to the extent that Parent makes such plan or program available to such US Employee and not in any case where credit would result in duplication of benefits), but not for purposes of any other employee benefit plan of Parent. Each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time and in which US Employees participate (the " _Parent Plans_ ") shall waive pre-existing condition 

   ##### 

  

 

limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the
applicable Benefit Plan. US Employees shall be given credit under the
applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time during
the year in which the Effective Time occurs under a corresponding Benefit
Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan. Parent shall
cause to be provided to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
primarily employed in Israel (the " _Israeli Employees_ " and, together with
the US Employees, the " _Employees_ ") any terms and conditions of
employment (including plans, programs and social insurance contributions or
arrangements) to the extent required by Israeli Law in order for Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries to avoid any liability that
would otherwise result from a failure to comply with relevant Israeli Law and
honor all Benefit Plans and Specified Benefit Agreements in which (or to
which) such Israeli Employees are a participant or a party in accordance with
their terms. 

   

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the terms of all Benefit Plans set forth in _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any Employee to continued employment by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective subsidiary thereof, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective subsidiary thereof, to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason or (ii) require Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any respective subsidiary thereof, to continue any Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification, or termination thereof after the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) Parent agrees that the Company shall be permitted to pay (in accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), immediately prior to the Effective Time (to the extent not theretofore paid), 2008 incentive compensation to Employees who participate in the Companys annual incentive plans for fiscal year 2008. Such payments shall be made in accordance with the Companys annual incentive plans for fiscal year 2008 and all determinations relating thereto shall be consistent with the incentive compensation paid to Employees for fiscal year 2007.  _Section 6.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the actual bonuses to be paid to Employees under the Companys annual incentive plans for fiscal year 2008. 

  

 (d) This _Section 6.5_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.5_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.5_ or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective subsidiary thereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements; _provided_ that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public announcement if the Companys Board of Directors has effected any Change in Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification agreement between an Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof or as amended or entered into prior to the Closing with the consent of Parent), without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director liability set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company on the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (b) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six (6) years from the Effective Time, covering each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) (collectively, the " _Insured Parties_ ") on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 6.7(b)_, Parent shall not be obligated to pay more than $1,040,000 in the aggregate to obtain such policy. It is understood and agreed that in the event such a policy cannot be obtained for $1,040,000 or less in the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to obtain as much coverage 

   ##### 

  

 

for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time as may be obtained
for such $1,040,000 aggregate amount. 

   

 (c) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.7_. 

  

 (d) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Company Special Meeting; Proxy Statement_. If required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Company Special Meeting") as soon as practicable following Subs acceptance of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, for the purpose of considering adopting this Agreement. In connection with the Company Special Meeting, as soon as practicable following Subs acceptance of and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall prepare with Parent and file with the SEC a proxy statement (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Merger and this Agreement and furnish the information required to be provided to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the DGCL and any other applicable Laws. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares to the extent required by applicable Laws. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel any comments or communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments or communications. Parent and its counsel shall be given 

    ##### 

  

    

a reasonable opportunity to review any responses to such comments or
communications, and the Company shall give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent
and its counsel.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to) each use their reasonable efforts to promptly (i) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be obtained by the Company or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) make all registrations, filings, notifications or submissions which are necessary or advisable, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the Israeli Anti-Trust Law and any other applicable antitrust laws, (C) the Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, 5719-1959, and the regulations and approvals promulgated thereunder, (D) the Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, 5744-1984, and the regulations and grant approvals promulgated thereunder by the OCS and (E) any other applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing party and including the timing of the initial filings, which will be made as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement; (iv) furnish all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party informed in all material respects of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any material written communication delivered to any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any proceeding by a private party relating thereto; (vii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties; provided that none of the Company, Parent or Sub shall be required to make any payment to any such third parties or concede anything of value to obtain such consents; (viii) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ix) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Each of the Company and the Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the Companys preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Tax Ruling.

 (c) by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time: 

   

 (i) upon a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Sub shall have become untrue in any material respect; _provided_ that if such breach is curable by Parent and Sub within thirty (30) days through the exercise of their reasonable efforts during such thirty (30) day period and Parent and Sub continue to exercise such reasonable efforts, the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ unless such breach is not cured within such thirty (30) day period; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ shall not be

the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Nondisclosure Agreement shall
survive any such termination in accordance with its terms. Nothing contained
in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or
any statement, act or failure to act that is intended to be a
misrepresentation or breach by such party of any representation, covenant
or agreement herein (including failure to consummate the Offer in accordance
with its terms) or in the Nondisclosure Agreement. 

   

 (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or (ii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, (B) there has been publicly disclosed for the first time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal (or the intention by any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal) and (C) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to (or consummates) a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal, then, in either case, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $13,150,000.00 in cash, (x) concurrently with any termination of this Agreement (in the case of a payment required by clause (i) above) or (y) on the date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii)(C) (in the case of a payment required by clause (ii) above).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the fee referred to in this _Section 8.2(b)_ (X) on more than one occasion or (Y) if, at the time this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement could have been terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(i)_. Upon payment of such fee, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or Sub with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

hereof and (b) are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the

Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 6.7_ from and after the

 Section 9.8 _Governing Law_.

However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each nonbreaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
