shall surrender to Parent all Company Certificates which, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented any shares of Company Common Stock; and (ii)
subject to Section 5.12, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to each Person
in whose name a Company Certificate shall have been registered, in exchange
therefor, cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Amount
of the Closing Date Merger Consideration, less the Per Share Amount of the
Holdback, times (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Company Certificate. Each Company Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Final payments to the stockholders of the Company of
all or any portion of the Per Share Amount of the Holdback shall be made in
accordance with Section 5.10.

 

12 (b) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
Company Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.5.



(c) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Company Certificates or Company Warrant. If any
Company Certificate or Company Warrant shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Certificate or Company Warrant to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the executing of an indemnity agreement
satisfactory to Parent or the posting of a lost instrument bond sufficient to
cover any claim which may be made regarding such Company Certificate or
Company Warrant, Parent shall pay to such holder, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate or Company Warrant the Merger
Consideration deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.



2.6 Closing. The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date at such time
and place as is agreed upon by Parent and the Company.



2.7 Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
immediately when the Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing by the
Secretary of State of Delaware or at such time thereafter as is provided
in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). As soon as practicable
after the Closing, the Certificate of Merger shall be filed, and the Effective
Time shall occur, on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
Certificate of Merger may be filed prior to the Closing Date or prior to the
Closing so long as it provides for an effective time that occurs on the
Closing Date immediately after the Closing.



2.8 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent, Merger Sub,
and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger under the
DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in the name of
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise, to take, and shall take, all such
lawful and necessary action.



2.9 Earnest Money. Contemporaneous with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit cash in an amount equal to $6,000,000 (the
"Earnest Money") with Bank of Oklahoma, N.A., as escrow agent, pursuant to
that certain Escrow Agreement of even date herewith among Parent, the Company
and Bank of Oklahoma, N.A., as escrow agent. The Earnest Money shall not be
included in any calculation of the Companys Working Capital Balance under
Section 5.10. In the event the Closing occurs, the Earnest Money (together
with any interest actually earned and paid with respect thereto) shall be
returned to Parent or Merger

 

13 Sub. If the Closing does not occur, the Earnest Money (together with such
interest) shall be delivered to the Company or returned to Parent or Merger
Sub in accordance with this Section 2.9. If this Agreement is terminated due
to any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of a representation or warranty or
failure by Parent or Merger Sub to perform a covenant under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, Parent or Merger Subs failure or refusal to
close the transaction contemplated hereby on the Closing Date notwithstanding
that each of the conditions contained in Article 6 has been either fulfilled
in all material respects, or waived, the Company shall be entitled to the
Earnest Money (together with such interest) as liquidated damages in lieu of
all other damages (and as the Companys sole remedy in such event). The
Parties hereby acknowledge that the extent of damages to the Company
occasioned by such failure or refusal by Parent or Merger Sub would be
impossible or extremely impractical to ascertain and that the amount of the
Earnest Money (together with such interest) is a fair and reasonable estimate
of such damages under the circumstances. In the event the Closing does not
occur and the Earnest Money (together with such interest) is not delivered to
the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9, the
Earnest Money (together with such interest) shall be returned to Parent or
Merger Sub. The Parties agree to disburse the Earnest Money (together with
such interest) and to give instructions to Bank of Oklahoma, N.A., as escrow
agent, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and further agree that
any breach of this obligation to disburse the Earnest Money shall give rise to
a separate cause of action for damages for such breach, apart from the damages
covered by the Earnest Money. The Parties agree that the subject matter of
this Agreement, including the business, assets and properties of the Company,
is unique, and that Parent would be harmed irreparably in the event the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the Company in accordance
with their specific terms, and that remedies at law are inadequate to
compensate Parent if it is not in default or breach. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that Parent is entitled to the remedy of specific performance of the
terms of this Agreement.



2.10 Excluded Assets. Prior to the Closing, the Excluded Assets will be
distributed by the Company to its stockholders or otherwise transferred to
one or more of the stockholders of the Company or their nominee(s). None of
the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement nor any of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall be applicable to the Excluded
Assets.

Schedule.

certificates, disclosures of parties in interest, and other similar matters
contained in such leases or other documents (or otherwise applicable thereto
by Law, rule or regulation) and is fully qualified to own and hold all such
leases and other interests; (ii) there are no provisions applicable to such
leases and other documents which increase the royalty share of the lessor
thereunder; and (iii) upon the establishment and maintenance of production in
commercial quantities, such leases and other interests are to be in full
force and effect over the economic life of the property involved and do not
have terms fixed by a certain number of years;



(e) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Companys Oil and
Gas Interests are being received by the Company or its Subsidiary in a timely
manner and are not being held in suspense for any reason (except for amounts,

 

22 individually or in the aggregate, not in excess of $50,000 and held in
suspense in the ordinary course of business); and



(f) no Person has any call upon, option to purchase, preferential right to
purchase or similar rights with respect to the Companys Oil and Gas Interests
or to the production therefrom.



3.23 Gas Imbalances. To the knowledge of the Company, except as is reflected

the Company is properly reflected in Section 3.25 of the Disclosure Schedule

based on information given to the Company by third-party operators for all
wells not operated by the Company, the Payout Balance for any such third-party
operated well in which the Company owns an interest is properly reflected in
Section 3.25 of the Disclosure Schedule as of the respective date(s) shown
thereon. "Payout Balance(s)" means the status, as of the dates of the
Companys calculations, of the recovery by the Company or a third party of a

authorities for expenditure with respect to the Companys Oil and Gas
Interests would not require the Company to make or incur after the Closing
capital expenditures with respect to any one property in excess of $75,000 net
to the Companys interest, except as set forth in Section 3.27 of the
Disclosure Schedule.



 

3.28 Other Mineral Related Matters. Except as set forth in Section 3.28 of the
Disclosure Schedule, as of the execution date of this Agreement, the Company
was not obligated by virtue of any prepayment arrangement, "take or pay"
arrangement, production payment arrangement, gas balancing agreement or
otherwise, to deliver or to suffer the delivery of Hydrocarbons produced in
connection with any of the Companys Oil and Gas Interests at some future
time (or make a cash payment in lieu thereof) without then or thereafter
receiving full payment therefor without deduction or credit on account of such
arrangement from the price that would otherwise be received.

 

23 3.29 Additional Drilling Obligations. Except as set forth in Section 3.29 of
the Disclosure Schedule: (a) the Company has no obligation, including
obligations implied in law, to drill additional wells or conduct other
material development operations in order to earn or continue to hold during
the primary term of any lease any portion of the Companys Oil and Gas
Interests, and (b) the Company has not been advised by a lessor under any
lease affecting any of the Companys Oil and Gas Interests of any requirements
or demands to drill additional wells or conduct additional development
operations.



3.30 Financial and Product Hedging Contracts. Section 3.30 of the Disclosure
Schedule accurately summarizes the outstanding hedging positions under all
outstanding Product Hedging Contracts and financial hedging positions of the
Company (including fixed price controls, collars, swaps, caps, hedges and
puts) as of the date reflected in Section 3.30 of the Disclosure Schedule.



3.31 Books and Records. All books, records and files of the Company (including

assets, those pertaining to the production, gathering, transportation and
sale of Hydrocarbons, and corporate, accounting, financial and employee
records): (a) have been prepared, assembled and maintained in accordance with
usual and customary policies and procedures and (b) fairly and accurately
reflect the ownership, use, enjoyment and operation by the Company of its
assets.



3.32 Reserve Report. The Company has delivered to Parent a copy of the
Reserve Report. Except as set forth in Section 3.32 of the Disclosure
Schedule, the factual information underlying the estimates of reserves in the
Reserve Report (including production, volumes, sales prices for production,
contractual pricing provisions under oil or gas sales or marketing contracts
or under hedging arrangements, costs of operations and development, and
working interest and net revenue information relating to the
Companys Ownership Interests) has been made available to Parent, and was
true and correct in all material respects on the date of the Reserve Report;
provided, however: (i) the reserves included in such report are estimates only
and should not be construed as exact quantities, (ii) such reserves may or
may not be recovered and, if recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs
related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts, (iii) the
sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in
recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions included in the Reserve
Report, and (iv) estimates of such reserves may increase or decrease as a
result of future operations.



3.33 Disclosure and Investigation. No representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements contained herein not misleading.

5.5 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of: (a) any representation or warranty contained in Article 3 being

development that would cause (or could reasonably be expected to cause) any
representation or warranty contained in Article 3 to be untrue or inaccurate

a breach or default or any right of acceleration or cancellation thereunder

5.10 Adjustment to Base Merger Consideration.



(a) Title and Environmental Defects. Parent may conduct, at its sole cost,
such title examination or investigation, and other examinations and
investigations, as it may in its sole discretion choose to conduct with
respect to the Companys Oil and Gas Interests in order to determine whether
any Title or Environmental Defects exist. Parent must deliver to the Company
in writing when discovered but in any event on or before October 29, 2002, a
written notice specifying each defect associated with the Oil and Gas
Interests of the Company that it asserts constitutes a violation of the
representations set forth in Sections 3.15 or 3.18 (a "Title or Environmental
Defect"), a description of each such Title or Environmental Defect, the amount
of the adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration that it asserts based on
such defect and its method of calculating such adjustment. If such notice is
not timely submitted, Parent will be deemed to have waived its basis for a
Merger Consideration adjustment under this Section 5.10 based on a violation
of the representations set forth in Sections 3.15 or 3.18. For the purpose of
determining an Environmental Defect under this Section 5.10 only, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.18 shall be deemed not
to be qualified by the knowledge of the Company. Upon timely delivery of a
notice of a Title or Environmental Defect under this Section 5.10(a), Parent
and the Company will in good faith negotiate the validity of the claim and the
amount of any adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration using the following
criteria:



(i) No single Title or Environmental Defect shall be taken into account as an
adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration unless the value of such defect is
determined to be more than $50,000 (the "Individual Defect Threshold").

 

31 (ii) No adjustment will be made to the Base Merger Consideration under this
Section 5.10(a) except to the extent that the net total of all individual
adjustments that exceed the Individual Defect Threshold under this Section
5.10(a) exceed $400,000 in the aggregate (the "Aggregate Defect Threshold");
by way of example, if the net total of all individual adjustments that exceed
the Individual Defect Threshold under this Section 5.10(a) equals $410,000,
then an adjustment of $10,000 shall be made to the Base Merger Consideration.



(iii) If the requested adjustment is based on the Company owning a net
revenue interest for a well, unit rights or leasehold rights less than that
shown in Schedule 1.1, then a downward adjustment shall be calculated by
multiplying the Allocated Value set forth for such well, unit rights or
leasehold rights on Schedule 1.1 by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is
an amount equal to the net revenue interest shown on Schedule 1.1 for such
well, unit rights or leasehold rights less the decimal share to which the
Company would be entitled as a result of its ownership interest in such well,
unit rights or leasehold rights which is unaffected by such Title Defect, and
(B) the denominator of which is the net revenue interest shown for such well,
unit rights or leasehold rights on Schedule 1.1. Any downward adjustments
requested by Parent may be offset by upward adjustments if it is determined
that the Companys net revenue interest for any other well, unit rights or
leasehold rights shown on Schedule 1.1 is greater than that shown on Schedule
1.1.



(iv) If the adjustment is based on the Company owning a working interest that
is larger than the working interest shown on Schedule 1.1, but without a
proportionate increase in the Companys net revenue interest, then the
adjustment is calculated by determining the effective net revenue interest
that results from such larger working interest, determining what the net
revenue interest would be using such effective net revenue interest and the
working interest shown on Schedule 1.1 and then calculating the adjustment in
the manner set forth in clause (iii) preceding.



(v) If the adjustment is based on a Lien or other monetary charge upon an Oil
and Gas Interest or a liability to remediate or otherwise cure an
environmental defect related to an Oil and Gas Interest that is liquidated in
amount, then the adjustment is the lesser of (A) the amount necessary to
remove such Lien or other monetary charge from, or a liability to remediate or
otherwise cure an environmental defect relating to, the affected Oil and Gas
Interest, or (B) the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas Interest. In
the alternative, either the Company or Parent may elect to treat any such Oil
and Gas Interest as an Excluded Asset in the event the adjustment for such Oil
and Gas Interest exceeds the Allocated Value of the affected Oil and Gas
Interest and, in the event such election is made, the Allocated Value of the
affected Oil and Gas Interest shall be deducted from the Base Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 5.10, including Sections
5.10(a)(i) and 5.10(a)(ii); provided, however, that if such deduction would
not be realized because it either did not exceed the Individual

 

32 Defect Threshold or the Aggregate Defect Threshold when aggregated with all
other deductions, then such affected Oil and Gas Interest shall not be
treated as an Excluded Asset.



(vi) If the adjustment is based on an obligation, burden or liability upon
the affected Oil and Gas Interest (other than a gas imbalance) for which
Parents economic detriment is not liquidated but can be estimated with
reasonable certainty, then the adjustment is the amount necessary to
compensate Parent at Closing for the adverse economic effect on the affected
Oil and Gas Interest.



(b) Actions to Address Title or Environmental Defect. If the Aggregate Defect
Threshold is exceeded by the net total of asserted Title and Environmental
Defects each of which exceeds the Individual Defect Threshold and, therefore,
the Base Merger Consideration would be decreased by adjustments made pursuant
to this Section 5.10, the Company may, at its sole option and upon written
notice to Parent, do any of the following or a combination thereof:

 



(i) remove from this Agreement, any or all of the Oil and Gas Interests with
respect to which a Title or Environmental Defect in excess of the Individual
Defect Threshold has been asserted (in which case such Oil and Gas Interests
shall become Excluded Assets), and reduce the Base Merger Consideration by the
Allocated Value of such excluded Oil and Gas Interests, unless Parent accepts
the Title or Environmental Defect without an adjustment to the Base Merger
Consideration; provided, if a Title or Environmental Defect is asserted
against an interest in, or rights to, a unit or a well or lease within a
unit, the Companys option to exclude the affected Oil and Gas Interest from
this Agreement shall extend to all wells, leases and unit interests associated
with such unit, and, in such case, the Base Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted by the Allocated Value of all such wells, leases and unit
interests;



(ii) elect to cure some or all of the Title or Environmental Defects, in
which case this transaction will close as provided in this Agreement, but no
price adjustment will be made for that Title or Environmental Defect; provided
that all such defects are cured to Parents reasonable satisfaction prior to
the Closing;



(iii) adjust the Base Merger Consideration in accordance with the criteria in
this Section 5.10 and the Company will include such adjustment in the Merger
Consideration calculation delivered pursuant to Section 5.10; and/or



 

(iv) in the event that the aggregate potential adjustments to the Base Merger
Consideration pursuant to Sections 5.10(a) and (b) could reduce the Merger
Consideration by more than $2,500,000, terminate this Agreement.



(c) Additional Adjustments.



(i) In addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this Section 5.10,
the Base Merger Consideration will be adjusted (A) upward or downward, as
applicable, by the Companys positive or negative Working Capital Balance as

 

33 of the Asset Value Effective Date, (B) downward by the total principal,
interest, fees and expenses due on all loans outstanding under the Bank
Credit Agreement as of the Asset Value Effective Date, (C) downward by the
aggregate amount of the severance/retention bonuses payable by the Company in
connection with the Merger, (D) downward by the amount of the fees payable by
the Company to Petrie Parkman and Co., Inc. as a result of the Merger, and (E)
downward by an amount equal to 50 percent of the premiums for the liability
insurance to be maintained in accordance with Section 5.13. For purposes
hereof, the "Working Capital Balance" as of the Asset Value Effective Date
shall be equal to the Companys aggregate cash, accounts receivable and other
current assets as of such date, less the Companys accounts payable and other
current liabilities as of such date and less $172,000 which represents one-
half of the Enron accounts receivable as of such date, excluding, however, the
current portion of any income tax liabilities, any assets or liabilities for
Product Hedging Contracts under FAS 133, the accrued interest receivable on
the management loans set forth on Section 5.12 to the Disclosure Schedule, and
the total principal, interest, fees and expenses due on all loans outstanding
under the Bank Credit Agreement as of such date (including the current portion
thereof).



(ii) Not later than five days before the Closing, the Company will determine
its Working Capital Balance, pursuant to GAAP (except as modified by the
definition of Working Capital Balance set forth in Section 5.10(c)), and the
other adjustments required under Section 5.10 using good faith estimates
based on the best available information and will deliver to Parent a statement
setting forth all of the adjustments to the Base Merger Consideration that are
required pursuant to this Agreement, calculated using such estimates (the
"Closing Date Statement"). Payments at the Closing shall be on the basis of
the Base Merger Consideration as adjusted for such estimates (the "Closing
Date Merger Consideration"). At the Closing, Parent shall retain $500,000 of
the Closing Date Merger Consideration (the "Holdback") to cover any potential
post-closing downward adjustment resulting from the actual Working
Capital Balance being less than the estimated Working Capital Balance. If
information becomes available during the 60-day period following the Closing
that causes either Parent or any of the former holders of Company Certificates
to determine that the actual Working Capital Balance varied from the
estimated Working Capital Balance set forth in the Closing Date Merger
Consideration calculation based on such estimates, the Parties shall in good
faith work together to reconcile such discrepancy. If the Parties have not
agreed within 70 days following the Closing Date, the final Working Capital
Balance will be determined by Grant Thornton LLP. The Parties agree that Grant
Thornton LLPs final Working Capital Balance shall be conclusive, and Grant
Thornton LLPs fees associated with the determination of such final Working
Capital Balance shall be paid by Parent out of the Holdback. No later than 80
days following the Closing Date: (i) if it is determined that the actual
Working Capital Balance was less than the estimated Working Capital Balance
set forth in the Closing Date Statement (the amount thereof being referred to
as the "Working Capital Deficiency"), then Parent shall retain for its own
account such part of the Holdback as is equal to the Working Capital
Deficiency (or all of the Holdback if the Working Capital Deficiency

 

34 exceeds the Holdback) and, if the Working Capital Deficiency is less than
the Holdback, pay the balance of the Holdback to the former holders of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Warrants in accordance
with Sections 2.5(a), 2.4(b)(ii) and 2.4(b)(iii), respectively; or (ii) if it
is determined that the actual Working Capital Balance was greater than the
estimated Working Capital Balance set forth in the Closing Date Statement (the
amount thereof being referred to as the "Working Capital Surplus"), Parent
shall pay to the former holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options and Company Warrants in accordance with Sections 2.5(a), 2.4(b)(ii)
and 2.4(b)(iii), respectively, an aggregate amount equal to the sum of the
Working Capital Surplus (up to a maximum of $500,000) plus the Holdback;
provided, that no payment shall be required for any such variance unless the
variance is at least $50,000.



5.11 Company Employees. The Parties acknowledge that, after the Effective
Time, Parent may or may not, in its sole discretion, offer employment to, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to continue the employment of, employees of
the Company. For a period of 18 months following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (a) maintain the
Companys health benefit plans for the benefit of the continuing and
terminated employees of the Company, or (b) provide such Persons with the
rights and benefits of Parents employee health benefit plans; provided, that
Parent shall not be required to pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay, the premiums for coverage under such plans for any terminated employee
of the Company, except to the extent provided in any severance agreement
agreed to by the Company (and approved by Parent if such agreement is made
prior to the Closing) and such employee. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, fulfill all coverage continuation obligations
imposed by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA for those
employees of the Company who are not retained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and the employees
of the Company covered by the Company Employee Benefit Plans at the Effective
Time and their respective heirs and representatives.



5.12 Management Loans. The Parties acknowledge that the Stockholders, all of
whom are officers of the Company and holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Stock Options, are obligated to the Company for certain amounts under
loans from the Company to the Stockholders. Such loans are listed on
Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule. At the Closing, the total amount of
principal and interest due on such loans shall be set off against the amounts
of Closing Date Merger Consideration to which the Stockholders are entitled
under this Agreement. Any internal allocations among the Stockholders listed
on Section 5.12 of the Disclosure Schedule shall be the obligation of those
Stockholders and not of the Company or the Parent.



5.13 Insurance. From and after the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause
to be maintained in effect for a period of not less than five years from the
Closing the current policies of liability insurance maintained by the Company
for the benefit of its directors and officers and their Affiliates. The
provisions of this Section 5.13 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Persons covered by such insurance and their
respective heirs and representatives.

 

35 5.14 Certificates. Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a certificate or other document, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, executed by each of the holders of Company Common
Stock certifying that: (i) each stockholder approves the transaction
contemplated hereby; (ii) each stockholders respective ownership interest in
the Company as of the Closing is as set forth on Schedule 3.6 to the
Disclosure Schedule; (iii) each stockholder agrees to the cancellation of
their Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company Warrants at the
Closing in return for rights to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration,
all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iv) each stockholder will
surrender their Company Certificates and Company Warrants, as the case may
be, for cancellation at the Closing or, in lieu thereof, provide Parent with
an executed lost stock certificate or warrant affidavit and indemnity or bond,
as may be appropriate; (v) each stockholder will cooperate in any way
reasonably requested to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the termination of the agreements referenced in Section 5.8 hereof;
and (vi) each stockholder will indemnify Parent and the Company after the
Closing from any and all claims brought by any Person against Parent or the
Company who was a holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company
Warrants prior to the Closing based on allegations that any payments made in
accordance with this Agreement and the ownership interests set forth on
Schedule 3.6 to the Disclosure Schedule were improper. Prior to or at the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or other document,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, executed by each of
the holders of Company Options who is not also a holder of Company Common
Stock certifying that each such holder agrees to the cancellation of such
holders Company Options at the Closing as set forth in this Agreement.

(b) By either Parent or the Company if (i) the Closing has not occurred by
December 20, 2002 (provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) shall not be available to any Party
whose breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted
in the failure of Closing to occur on or before such date); or (ii) any
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting Closing and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable (provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not be available to any
Party until such Party has used all reasonable efforts to remove such
injunction, order or decree);

 

38 (c) By Parent if (i) there has been a breach of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Article 3 (provided, however, that Parent
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i)
unless Parent has given the Company at least 15 days prior notice of
such breach, the Company has failed to cure such breach within such 15-day
period, and the condition described in Section 6.2(a), other than the
provision thereof relating to the certificate signed by the chief executive
officer or chief operating officer of the Company, would not be satisfied if
the Closing were to occur on the day on which Parent gives the Company notice
of such termination); or (ii) the Company has failed to comply in any material
respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement
and such failure has not been, or cannot be, cured within a reasonable time
after notice and demand for cure thereof; or



(d) By the Company if (i) there has been a breach of the representations and
warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in Article 4 (provided, however,

notice of such breach, Parent has failed to cure such breach within such
15-day period, and the condition described in Section 6.3(a), other than the
provision thereof relating to the certificate signed by the chief executive
officer or chief operating officer of Parent, would not be satisfied if the
Closing were to occur on the day on which the Company gives Parent notice of
such termination); or (ii) Parent or Merger Sub has failed to comply in any
material respect with any of its respective covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement, and such failure has not been, or cannot be, cured within

liability for damages incurred as a result of a breach by such Party of its
covenants, agreements or other obligations hereunder occurring prior to such
termination. If termination is due to any breach by the Company of a
representation or warranty or failure by the Company to perform a covenant

Limited Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification. 

---|---|---|--- 



(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.15, 3.16,
3.17, 3.18, 3.19, 3.20, 3.22, 3.23, 3.24, 3.25, 3.26, 3.27, 3.28, 3.29, 3.32
and 3.33 and in Article 4 shall not survive the Closing. All of the remaining
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article 3 shall
survive the Closing until the date that is six months following the Closing
Date and shall be enforceable against only the Stockholders. Except as to the
survival of those representations and warranties set forth above in this
Section 8.1(a), the representations and warranties contained herein are to
serve only as a basis for a Party to assert, under Article VI, that the
conditions to Closing have not been met. Accordingly, except as to the
survival of those representations and warranties set forth above in this
Section 8.1(a), no Party shall have any liability to any other Party based on
any representation or warranty made herein or in the certificates delivered
pursuant to Sections 6.2(a) and 6.3(a).



(b) Indemnification. The Stockholders hereby agree to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Parent and its directors, officers, employees and Affiliates
(hereinafter, collectively, "related persons"), from and against all Claims
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by Parent or Parents
related persons (each an "Indemnified Person"), to the extent resulting from
the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in Article 3 that survives the Closing as set forth in Section
8.1(a). As used in this Section 8.1, the term "Claim" shall include (i) all
debts, liabilities and obligations; (ii) all losses, damages, costs and
expenses, including pre- and post-judgment interest, penalties, court costs
and attorneys fees and expenses; and (iii) all demands, claims, actions,
costs of investigation, causes of action, proceedings, arbitrations,
judgments, settlements and assessments, whether or not ultimately determined
to be valid.



(c) Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event any Claim is asserted against
any Indemnified Person by a third party, the Indemnified Person shall, with
reasonable promptness, notify the Stockholders of such Claim. If the
Indemnified Person does not so notify the Stockholders within 15 days after
becoming aware of such Claim, then the Stockholders shall, if such delay
materially prejudices the Stockholders with respect to the defense of such
Claim, be relieved of liability hereunder in respect of such Claim to the
extent of the damage caused by such delay. In any such proceeding, following
receipt of notice properly given, the Stockholders shall be entitled, at
their sole discretion, to assume the entire defense of such Claim (with
counsel selected by them which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person or Persons), and the Stockholders shall bear the entire cost of
defending such Claim. The Stockholders shall not have the right to settle any
such Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Person or Persons,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event of the
assumption of the defense by the Stockholders, the Stockholders shall not be
liable for any further legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Persons in

 

40 connection with such defense unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
Stockholders or as herein provided; provided, however, the Indemnified
Persons shall have the right to participate in such defense, at their own
cost, and shall have the obligation to cooperate therewith.



(d) Limits on Indemnity Obligations.



(i) No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to seek indemnification from the
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 8.1 with respect to any Claim unless
such Indemnified Person notifies the Stockholders of such Claim within six
months after the Closing Date.



(ii) If the total amount of all Claims which the Indemnified Persons have the
right to assert against the Stockholders under this Section 8.1 ("Parent
Claims") does not exceed an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the "Basket"), then
the Stockholders shall have no obligation under this Section 8.1 with respect
to any such Claim. If the total amount of all Parent Claims exceeds the
Basket, then the Stockholders obligations under this Section 8.1 shall be
limited to the amount by which the aggregate amount of all Parent Claims
exceeds the Basket.



(iii) Once the total amount of all Parent Claims exceed the Basket, the
Stockholders obligations under this Section 8.1 shall be limited to an
aggregate maximum amount equal to $2,500,000.



(iv) The amount of any indemnification provided under this Section 8.1 shall
be net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance policies.



 

(v) The Stockholders shall not have any liability for any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty if and to the extent that the Claim resulting from such
misrepresentation or breach of warranty is covered by an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration.



(e) Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Parents sole remedy for any breach of any of the provisions of
Article 3 that survive the Closing as set forth in Section 8.1(a) shall be to
exercise its rights under this Section 8.1, which shall be subject to the
procedures and limitations set forth in this Section 8.1, excluding, however,
any cause of action for specific performance.



8.2 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
instrument signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

42 8.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.



8.5 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, that certain Letter Agreement dated
October 8, 2002, between Parent and the Company, that certain Letter Agreement
dated November 6, 2002, between Parent and the Company regarding Title or
Environmental Defects and the documents and instruments delivered by the
Parties in connection with this Agreement): (a) constitutes the entire
agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; and (b) except as provided in Sections 5.2, 5.11, 5.13 and 8.1, is
solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and assigns and does not confer on any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder.



8.7 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects,
including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.



8.8 No Remedy in Certain Circumstances. Each Party agrees that, should any
court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or
part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this Agreement
or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate pursuant to Article 7. Except as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement, to the extent that a Party took an action inconsistent
herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or required hereby
pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other competent Governmental
Authority, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation unless such
Party breached its obligations under Section 5.3 or did not in good faith seek
to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such order or judgment.



8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, except that Parent may assign, in its sole discretion, its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
provided that Parent shall notify the Company of any such assignment and

 

43 remain responsible for all of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.



8.10 Waivers. At any time prior to the Closing, the Parties may, to the
extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the covenants
or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall
be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of
compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any
provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior
or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof.



8.11 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall constitute a part of this Agreement
for all purpose and shall remain in full force and effect following the
execution of this Agreement until terminated in accordance with its terms.
Any and all information received by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement nor this Section 8.11 shall prohibit
Parent from making any required filings under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.
