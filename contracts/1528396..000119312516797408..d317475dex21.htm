prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement
(the "Company Closing Statement") setting forth Company s good faith estimate
of: (i) __the amount of any Company Debt (the "Estimated Company Debt"); and

"Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Amount"). A copy of the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries dated as of the
Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") shall be attached to the Company
Closing Statement. The Company Closing Statement shall have been prepared by
the Company in accordance with the Accounting Policies, shall present fairly,
on a good faith basis, using the Company s reasonable best efforts to obtain
the most current and accurate data available, the information contained
therein as of the Closing Date, and shall be the form of _Schedule 2.7(a)_
attached hereto. Such Company Closing Statement shall be certified by the
Companys Chief Financial Officer as having been prepared in accordance with
the foregoing principles.

(b) To the extent that the Company Closing Statement is reasonably acceptable
to Parent, with such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned withheld or
delayed, the Company Closing Statement, together with the Statement of
Estimated Expenses, the Estimated Change in Control Payments Statement, the
Estimated Unpaid Wage Statement and the Estimated Pre-Closing Taxes, in each
case delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, shall be used to calculate
the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing; _provided_ , that if there is a
manifest error contained in, or Parent cannot reasonably accept, the Company
Closing Statement, the Statement of Estimated Expenses, the Estimated Change
in Control Payments Statement, the Estimated Unpaid Wage Statement or the
Estimated Pre-Closing Taxes Statement, then Parent shall be entitled to use
its reasonable estimates, prepared in good faith, of the amounts contained in
such statements for purposes of calculating the Base Purchase Price payable at
Closing; provided, that such reasonable estimates must be determined in
accordance with the Accounting Policies.

 

(c) Within ninety (90) __days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
the Seller a statement (the "Parent Closing Statement"), executed by Parent,
setting forth Parent s good faith calculations of the following as of the
Closing: (i) the amount of any Company Debt; (ii) __an itemized calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital Amount; and (iii) __the Post-Closing
Adjustment. The Parent Closing Statement shall have been prepared by Parent in
accordance with the Accounting Policies. If, for any reason, Parent fails to
deliver the Parent Closing Statement within the time period required by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_, the Company Closing Statement delivered by the
Company to the Parent prior to the Closing shall be considered for all
purposes of this Agreement as being the "Final Closing Statement" and Parent
and Seller shall have all of their respective rights and obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(h)_ with respect to such certificate.

 

(d) If the Seller delivers written notice (the "Disputed Items Notice") to
Parent, within thirty (30) __days after the date of delivery of the Parent
Closing Statement (the "Review Period"), stating that the Seller objects to
any items on the Parent Closing Statement and specifying the basis for such
objection in reasonable detail and setting forth the Seller s proposed
modifications to the Parent Closing Statement, the Seller and Parent will
attempt to resolve and finally determine and agree upon the Post-Closing
Adjustment as promptly as practicable. If the Seller does not deliver
the Disputed Items Notice to Parent within thirty (30) __days after the date
of delivery of the Parent Closing Statement, the calculation of the Post-
Closing Adjustment specified in the Parent Closing Statement will be
conclusively presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will be
final and binding upon the parties.

 



23 (e) If the Seller delivers a Disputed Items Notice in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(d)_, the Seller and Parent will attempt in good faith to
resolve the disputed items. If the Seller and Parent are unable to agree upon
the disputed items within thirty (30) __days after delivery of the Disputed
Items Notice, the Seller and Parent will engage an independent, nationally
recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Seller and Parent and
that does not have a pre-existing client relationship with either Seller or
Parent (in either case, the "Accounting Firm") to resolve the disputed items
specified in the Disputed Items Notice. The Accounting Firm shall address only
the disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice and may not assign
a value greater than the greatest value claimed for such item by either party
or smaller than the smallest value claimed for such item by either party. The
Accounting Firm will (i) __ resolve the disputed items specified in the
Disputed Items Notice and (ii) determine the Post-Closing Adjustment, as
modified only by the resolution of such items. The determination of the
Accounting Firm will be made within sixty (60) days after being selected and
will be final and binding upon the parties. The fees, costs and expenses of
the Accounting Firm will be borne by the Seller, on the one hand, and Parent,
on the other, in inverse proportion as each party may prevail (based on
the disputed items as resolved by the Accounting Firm as compared to the
disputed items proposed by such party), as determined by the Accounting Firm,
or, if the Accounting Firm determines that neither party could be fairly found
to be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs and expenses will be borne
and paid 50% by the Seller and 50% by Parent.

(f) On the earlier to occur of: (i) __the date the Company Closing Statement
is deemed to be the Final Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ ,
(ii) the thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery of the Parent Closing
Statement if Seller has not properly delivered to Parent a Disputed Items
Notice pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ ; (iii) the date upon which Seller
acknowledges in writing that it has no objections to the Parent Closing
Statement; (iv) __ the date on which Parent and Seller mutually agree upon
all disputed items set forth in the Disputed Items Notice properly delivered
to Parent pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)_ ; or (v) __the date the Accounting Firm
delivers its final, binding resolution of the Disputed Items Notice pursuant
to _Section 2.7(e)_ , the Parent Closing Statement, with such revisions as may
be mutually agreed by Parent and Seller or required by the Accounting Firm
pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ will be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement
and shall be final and binding on the parties. The date on which the Parent
Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the
immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as the "Final Determination
Date."

(g) On the Final Determination Date:

 

(i) If the Closing Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 2.7_ is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Parent shall pay Seller such excess in accordance with
_Section 2.7(h)_. If the Closing Net Working Capital Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_ is less than the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Parent shall be entitled to receive such
shortfall in accordance with _Section 2.7(h)_.

(ii) If the Estimated Company Debt is greater than the Company Debt as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , Parent shall pay Seller such excess in
accordance with _Section 2.7(h)_. If the Estimated Company Debt is less than
the Company Debt as determined pursuant to _Section 2.7_ , Parent shall be
entitled to receive such shortfall in accordance with _Section 2.7(h)_.

 

(iii) Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant to this _Section 2.7(g)_
shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if any) owed by Parent to Seller, on
the one hand, or the Seller to Parent, on the other hand, shall be referred to
as the "Post-Closing Adjustment."

 



24 (h) In the event that the Post-Closing Adjustment is owed to Parent, the
Seller and Parent shall execute a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release an amount to Parent out of the Escrow
Account equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment: first from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, then from the Indemnification Escrow Amount. In the event that the
Post-Closing Adjustment owed to Parent is greater than the sum of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount plus the amount then remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Amount, then the Indemnifying Parties shall jointly and severally,
within five (5) __Business Days after the Final Determination Date, pay to
Parent the amount by which the Post-Closing Adjustment owed to Parent exceeds
the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount plus the amount then remaining in
the Indemnification Escrow Amount. In the event the Post-Closing Adjustment
is owed to Seller, Parent shall pay to Seller the Post-Closing Adjustment
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Determination Date. In the event
that any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount remains after giving effect
to any payment to Parent pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
2.7(h)_ , the Seller and Parent shall execute a joint instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller an amount in cash
equal to the portion of the remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Any joint instructions to the Escrow
Agent shall be made within five (5) __Business Days after the Final
Determination Date and the Escrow Agent shall make the payment of such amounts
to Parent or Seller, as applicable, within five (5) __Business Days of its
receipt of such joint instruction.

 

(i) The Seller and its accountants, lawyers and representatives will, upon
reasonable advance notice, be given reasonable access at all reasonable times
to (and, subject to the confidentiality provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.3_) shall be allowed to make copies of) the financial books and records of
the Company, in each case in connection with the determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment or any dispute relating thereto.

(j) The Company Closing Statement, the Parent Closing Statement, and the
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent
with the same accounting principles, policies, methodologies and procedures
used in preparing the 2015 Financials (the "Accounting Policies") to the
extent consistent with GAAP, except that, in calculating the component line
items of Closing Net Working Capital Amount, no effect shall be given to (i)
__the items excluded from the definition thereof, or (ii) __ the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

2.8 _Withholding_. Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Surviving Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, such amounts that are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal, state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law or under any applicable Law. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. To the extent that any amounts paid
pursuant to this Agreement are not reduced by such deductions or
withholdings, such Person shall indemnify Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Company) for any amounts imposed by any Tax
Authority, together with any costs and expenses related thereto (including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs of investigation).

 



25 2.9 _Escrow Account_. At Closing Parent shall deposit the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the Applicable State Taxes Escrow Amount, and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount in an escrow account with the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow
Account"), which amounts shall not become payable as of the Closing Date but
shall instead be paid in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of,
_Article VII_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement. The Company shall pay one-half
of the fees and expenses associated with the hiring and retention of the
Escrow Agent and such amounts will be deemed to be Transaction Expenses (the
"Seller Escrow Amount") and Parent shall pay the remaining half of such fees.
The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow and shall be available
to satisfy (and only to satisfy) any adjustment to the Purchase Price in favor
of Parent pursuant to _Section 2.7_. The Applicable State Taxes Escrow Amount
shall be held in escrow and shall be available to satisfy (and only

7.6_, any payments to be made out of the Escrow Account for the benefit of
the Seller shall be made to the Seller. The parties acknowledge that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, interest may be
imputed on payments from the Escrow Account to the extent required by Section
__483 and 1274 of the Code.

shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers and directors
(who are each hereby fully authorized, in the name of their
respective corporations, as applicable) to, execute, acknowledge and deliver

elected to be treated as a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" of the Seller
pursuant to Section 1361(a) of the Code from the date of its formation or has

U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each of these elections was effective when
initially made and is currently effective (without regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). The Seller has at all times satisfied the
requirements to qualify as an S corporation under Section 1361(a) of the Code,
and no event has occurred (or fact has existed) that would preclude the
Seller from qualifying as an S corporation under Section 1361(a) or which
would terminate the Sellers S corporation status or the Companys qualified
subchapter S subsidiary status (other than the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement). No Governmental Authority has challenged the effectiveness
of any of these elections.

acquired the stock of any corporation that is a qualified subchapter S
subsidiary other than the Company.

times been resident for Tax purposes in their country of incorporation or
formation and are not and have not at any time been treated as resident in any
other country for any Tax purpose (including any arrangement for the avoidance
of double taxation). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

permanent establishment or place of business of any other Person for any Tax
purpose.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are or have been a party
to a transaction or Contract that is in conflict with the Tax rules on
transfer pricing in any relevant jurisdiction. All applicable transfer pricing
rules have been complied with, and all documentation required by all relevant

6.1 _Board Recommendation, Shareholder Approval and Shareholder Notice_.

 

(a) The Board shall unanimously recommend that the Seller vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the principal terms of the
Merger, and neither the Board nor any committee thereof shall withhold,

Board that the Seller vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the principal terms of the Merger.

(b) The Company, the Seller and the Key Stakeholders shall take all action
necessary in accordance with this Agreement, the CCC and the Charter Documents
to obtain the Shareholder Approval and deliver to Parent a Written Consent
duly executed by Seller as soon as practicable following the execution of

execution and delivery of this Agreement. The obligation of the Company, the
Seller and the Key Stakeholders to obtain the Shareholder Approval and

disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal or the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or
modification by the Board of its unanimous recommendation to the Seller in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the principal
terms of the Merger.

 

6.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) During the period from the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will
not (and Seller and each of the Key Stakeholders will ensure that the Company
does not) authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, directly or

previously provided to such Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.
If any of the Representatives of the Company, the Seller or any of the Key
Stakeholders, whether in his, her or its capacity as such or in any other
capacity, takes any action that the Company, the Seller and the Key
Stakeholders are obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ not to authorize
or permit such Representative to take, then the Company, the Seller and the
Key Stakeholders shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have
breached this _Section 6.2_.

 

(b) The Company shall immediately (but in any event, within twenty-four (24)

to the Knowledge of the Company, by any of the Representatives of the Company,

inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and any correspondence or
communications related thereto and shall provide to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer and
any amendments, correspondence and communications related thereto, if it is in
writing, or a reasonable written summary thereof, if it is not in writing. The
Company shall provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or
such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Board) of any
meeting of the Board at which the Board is reasonably expected to discuss any
Acquisition Proposal.

information obtained pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements or the effectuation of the transactions

certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated January 11, 2016
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between the Company and Parent.

6.4 _Public Disclosure_. Each of the Company, the Seller and the Key
Stakeholders shall not (and they will use reasonable best efforts to cause

Pre-Closing incurred and expected to be incurred by the Company (including any

6.5(b)_ shall present fairly, on a good faith basis, using the Companys
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the most current and accurate data

Wage Obligations incurred or to be incurred by the Company or any of its
Affiliates that are not reflected on the Estimated Unpaid Wage Statement
("Additional Unpaid Wage Payments") and any unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes incurred
or to be incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates that are not

severally, shall bear, and to the extent permitted by Law shall pay, any and
all sales, use, transfer, value added, goods and services, gross receipts,
excise, conveyance and documentary, stamp, recording, registration,
conveyance and similar Taxes and fees incurred in connection with the purchase
and sale of the Shares ("Transfer Taxes"), and the Seller and the Key
Stakeholders shall, jointly and severally, reimburse Parent for any Transfer

Law.

6.7 _Tax Matters_. 

(a) The Seller shall cooperate fully with Parent in connection with the filing
of Returns and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon Parents
request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees
or representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder or
to participate in proceedings with respect to Taxes. In the event the Seller,
any Key Stakeholder, or Parent receives notice of any proposed audit, claim,
assessment or other dispute concerning Pre-Closing Taxes, they shall promptly
notify Parent or the Seller, as applicable, of such matter. Parent shall
ensure (after the Closing) the Company retains all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating

of the applicable statute of limitations for the respective taxable periods,
and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax

practicable thereafter, Parent shall prepare a schedule (the "Tax
Allocation"), which shall allocate the Purchase Price and any other relevant
items among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the regulations thereunder and provide such schedule to Seller for a
fifteen (15) day period for Sellers review and comment. Parent shall consider
any reasonable Seller comments to the Tax Allocation in good faith and agrees
to accept any such comments that Parent determines are neither detrimental
to Parent nor less likely to be sustained for Tax, accounting, audit, and
similar purposes; provided, however, that the Tax Allocation shall be
finalized as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. The parties shall
take no action inconsistent with the Tax Allocation (as finally determined by
Parent), and shall adopt and utilize the asset values as determined under the
Tax Allocation for all Tax purposes.

 

(c) Prior to Closing, the Company and the Seller shall not revoke the Sellers
election to be taxed as an S corporation or the Companys election to be
taxed as a "qualified

 



72  subchapter S subsidiary", in each case within the meaning of Sections 1361
and 1362 of the Code. The Company and the Seller shall not take or allow to be
taken any action (other than the transactions pursuant to this Agreement)
that would result in the termination of the Companys status as a validly
electing qualified subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361
of the Code.

 

(d) The parties hereto agree that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be treated as a sale by the Seller of the Companys assets to
Parent, followed by the contribution of such assets by Parent to the Company
in exchange for the stock of the Company in a transaction governed by Section
351 of the Code, pursuant to Section 1361(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Code and
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1361-5(b)(3) (Example 9). The parties hereto
shall take no position inconsistent with the foregoing in any Tax Return, any
proceeding before any Tax Authority or otherwise.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, (i) neither the Seller, the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall enter into, execute or otherwise agree to any voluntary
disclosure agreements, closing agreements, settlements, admissions, or other
resolutions with any state Tax Authority without the prior written consent of
the Parent and (ii) any written submissions to any such Tax Authority shall
be provided to Parent for its review and written approval prior to
submission.

6.8 _Preparation of Returns_.

 

(a) The Seller, at the Indemnifying Parties sole cost and expense, shall
prepare (or cause the Company to prepare and timely file) income Returns of
the Seller (including the IRS Form 1120S for the Company and any comparable
state and local Returns for the Tax period that includes the Closing Date)
(the "S Corporation Returns"). Each S Corporation Return shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods of the
Company unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Each S Corporation Return
due after the Closing Date shall be submitted to Parent for Parents review
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of the Tax Return (taking into
account any applicable extensions).

(b) The Seller, at the Indemnifying Parties sole cost and expense, shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns for
the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (other than
S Corporation Returns with respect to which the Company is treated as a
qualified subchapter S subsidiary and other than employment Returns prepared
and filed by the Companys payroll provider on behalf of the
Company); provided, however, Parent shall have the right to review and
approve all such Returns, which shall be provided not less than fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date thereof. All such Returns shall be prepared
consistent with past practice except as otherwise required by any applicable
Law. __

(c) No later than three (3) business days prior to the due date of payment of
Taxes on any Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall be
entitled to withdraw from the Escrow Account an amount equal to all Pre-
Closing Taxes due and payable with respect to any such Return, except to the
extent such Pre-Closing Taxes were taken into account in determining the Base
Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

6.9 _Repayment of Company Debt_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall
have taken all actions necessary for the repayment or prepayment of all of
the Company Debt existing as

 



73  of the Closing, including the obtaining of any required Payoff Letters and
making all appropriate arrangements for the prepayment or repayment thereof
(including the preparation of all documentation and the provision of all
endorsements required or reasonably necessary therefor) and arranging for the
release of all Liens, financing statements or other security interests
relating thereto.

 

6.10 _Termination of Plans_. The Company shall take all actions as Parent may
reasonably require, including, without limitation, the engagement of a third
party, to correct any compliance-related matters as set forth in _Section
3.22(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company and any ERISA Affiliate shall
terminate, effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation
plans, programs or arrangements and any and all Company Employee Plans
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement and any and all Company
Employee Plans intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 125 (each a
"Terminated Plan") (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such plans
shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Terminated Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of no later than
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the
Board, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of
such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Terminated Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of any Terminated Plan or correction of any Terminated Plan would
reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or
other fees then such charges and/or fees shall be deemed to be Transaction
Expenses, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Parent.

 

6.11 _New Employment Arrangements_. Parent or an Affiliate of Parent may offer
certain Employees, other than the Key Employees, employment by Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent as a Continuing Employee to be effective on or after the
Closing Date. Such employment will: (i) be set forth in an offer letter in
Parents or the relevant Affiliates modified standard form, (ii) be subject
to compliance with Parents or the relevant Affiliates applicable policies
and procedures, including employment background checks and the execution of
Parents employee proprietary information agreement, (iii) have terms,
including the position and salary, which will be determined by Parent, (iv)
include, if applicable, a waiver by the Employee of any future equity-based
compensation to which such Employee may otherwise have been eligible, and (v)
supersede any prior express or implied employment agreements, arrangements,
representations, or offer letter in effect prior to the Closing Date. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall terminate the employment or consulting services
of each individual who is a Non-Continuing Employee, effective as of no later
than immediately prior to the Closing. The Company shall pay all severance pay
and benefits (including but not limited to any acceleration of vesting) to
each Non-Continuing Employee prior to the Closing (such amounts "Non-
Continuing Employee Severance Amounts") and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a release reasonably satisfactory to Parent from each Non-
Continuing Employee. The Company shall pay all severance pay and notice
periods in any Employment Agreements with Employees or Key Employees prior to
the Closing.

 



74 6.12 _Indemnification of Covered Persons_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Closing existing as of the date of this
Agreement in favor of the current or former directors (including their
directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, spouses and controlling
Persons), officers or other employees of the Company currently indemnified by
the Company (collectively, the "Covered Persons") as provided by statute or
in the Charter Documents of the Company or the indemnity agreements listed on
_Schedule 6.12(a)_ will survive the transactions contemplated by the terms
of this Agreement and will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of not less than six years from the Closing, and
the Company will honor the foregoing indemnification obligations of the
Company for acts or omissions by such Covered Persons occurring on or prior
to the Closing.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company will purchase a prepaid
directors and officers liability insurance "run-off policy" with a claims
period of six years from the Closing Date, for the benefit of the Covered
Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors, officers and
employees of the Company occurring prior to the Closing (the "DandO Tail
Policy"). The cost of the DandO Tail Policy (net of any reduction or refund to
such cost from the termination of the Companys existing directors and
officers acts and omissions insurance policy) shall be included in the
Transaction Expenses of the Company. In all cases, and not withstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Covered Persons shall first
seek recourse against the DandO Tail Policy in connection with claims for
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
prior to seeking recourse against the Company for such indemnification.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.12_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Covered Person, and each such
Persons heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being
expressly agreed that such Persons will be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.12_ , and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have by contract or otherwise.

6.13 _Apportionment_. With respect to Taxes of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries relating to a Tax period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of Taxes that are allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined consistent with the following:
(A) in the case of income Taxes and all other Taxes that are not imposed on a

basis and (B) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis,

hand, shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll
or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or

 



78  other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the
other. The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of the parties indemnification obligations under this  _Article VII_ , all

81 7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.3(e)_ , the maximum liability for indemnification of
Losses arising out of, in connection with, or resulting from (i) the
circumstances described in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ (other than Losses arising out

Company or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by a Parent Indemnified
Party.

(d) Notwithstanding anything that may be deemed to be to the contrary set

against such Person be barred (and nothing herein shall serve as a defense
thereto) in relation to, any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful
misconduct committed by such Person or to any fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct of which such Person was
actually aware, _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall not be any double
recovery to the extent a claim is asserted pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_.

 

(e) The right to indemnification based on representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations in this Agreement will not be affected by
any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution

or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any

not include any Losses with respect to Taxes that arise as a result of any
breach of the Parent s obligations set forth in _Section 6.7_.

 



82 7.5 _Claims for Indemnification; Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(a) _Procedure for Claims_. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party may
have a right to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ (other than a
Third-Party Claim covered by _Section 7.5(b)_ below), then Parent (on behalf
of such Parent Indemnified Party) shall deliver to the Seller and the Escrow
Agent (if applicable) a certificate (a "Claim Certificate") (i) __stating
that a Parent Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred, or reasonably
anticipates that it may suffer or incur, Losses, and (ii) __specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for the claim(s), as well as the Losses relating
thereto (which, if not determinable at such time, may be a reasonable good
faith estimate thereof) (the aggregate amount of such Losses in a Claim
Certificate being referred to as the "Claimed Amount"). The Seller shall have
twenty (20) days after receipt of a Claim Certificate to deliver to Parent
and the Escrow Agent (if applicable) a certificate (an "Objection
Certificate"), pursuant to which the Seller shall, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties: (A) agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case, the Escrow Agent shall
pay to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Claimed Amount
or the applicable portion thereof as determined by Parent, and to the extent
the Claimed Amount is to be recovered in whole or in part directly from the
Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days, jointly and severally cause to be
paid to Parent an amount equal to the Claimed Amount _minus_ the portion of
the Claimed Amount actually deducted from the Escrow Account); (B) agree that
the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") (in which case, the Escrow Agent shall
pay to Parent from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Agreed Amount or
the applicable portion thereof as determined by Parent, and to the extent the
Agreed Amount is to be recovered in whole or in part directly from the
Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly, but in no event
later than five (5) __ Business Days, jointly and severally cause to be paid
to Parent an amount equal to the Agreed Amount _minus_ the portion of the
Agreed Amount actually deducted from the Escrow Account); or (C) __ contest
that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount and specify, in reasonable detail, any objections to the claims in such
Claim Certificate or the Claimed Amount. If the Seller fails to deliver an
Objection Certificate within twenty (20) __ days after receipt of a Claim
Certificate, then the Seller shall be deemed, for and on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, to agree that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the Claimed Amount (which deemed agreement shall be deemed
final, binding and conclusive with respect to all of the Indemnifying Parties)
(in which case, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow Account
an amount equal to the Claimed Amount or the applicable portion thereof as
determined by Parent, and to the extent the Claimed Amount is to be recovered
in whole or in part directly from the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying
Parties shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5) __
Business Days, jointly and severally cause to be paid to Parent an amount
equal to the Claimed Amount _minus_ the portion of the Claimed Amount actually
deducted from the Escrow Account).

 

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) In the event that Parent becomes aware of a third party claim (other than
a claim that is the subject of an Agreed Upon Loss) (each, a "Third Party
Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a demand for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_, Parent shall notify the
Seller and the Escrow Agent (if applicable) of such claim, and the Seller
shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at its sole option
and expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense
of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that 

 



83  Seller shall not have the ability, without the prior written consent of
Parent, to petition, make any motion to, or take any other procedural action
in connection with such Third Party Claim by or before, any Governmental
Authority. The failure to so notify the Seller shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Parties of any Liability, except to the extent the Seller
demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. If there is a Third Party Claim that, if
adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for Losses
hereunder, then any amounts incurred by the Parent Indemnified Parties in
defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim,
shall be deemed Losses hereunder. Parent shall have the right in its sole
discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that the consent of the Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) is not obtained,
no settlement of any such claim with third-party claimants will be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter;  _provided,
further_ , the consent of the Seller with respect to any settlement of any
such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the Seller
shall have objected within twenty (20) __ days after a written request
for such consent by Parent. In the event that the Seller has consented to or
deemed to have consented to any such settlement, the Indemnifying Parties
shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
_Article VII_ to the amount of any claim by Parent against the Escrow
Account with respect to such settlement. Neither the Seller nor any
Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the relevant Parent Indemnified Party(ies)
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Parent Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to withhold its consent, in its sole discretion, to any proposed
settlement or compromise that: (i) __ does not include a provision whereby
the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases such Parent Indemnified Party
from all Liabilities with respect thereto; (ii) __ would obligate such
Parent Indemnified Party to pay an amount related thereto in excess of the
amount then available in the Escrow Account; or (iii) could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the business or reputation (business or
otherwise) of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company). Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
diligently conduct the defense of each Third Party Claim and to seek
resolution of such Third Party Claim in a commercially reasonable manner.

(c) _Agreed Upon Losses_. _Section 7.5(d)_ below shall not apply to claims
made in respect of: (A) any inaccuracies in the Company Closing Statement or
(B) the matters specified in _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_ (each of (A) and (B) an
"Agreed Upon Loss"). Notwithstanding _Section 7.5(a)_ , the Seller and each
Indemnifying Party hereby waives the right to object to any claims against
the Escrow Account or otherwise in respect of any Agreed Upon Loss.

(d)  _Resolution of Conflicts_.

(i) In case the Seller shall timely deliver an Objection Certificate, then for
a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of such Objection Certificate,
the Seller and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to each of such claims objected to in the
Objection Certificate. If the Seller and Parent should reach agreement with
respect to such Objection Certificate, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Escrow Account, such memorandum shall be promptly delivered
to the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow
Account an amount equal to the Losses so agreed or the applicable portion
thereof as determined by Parent, and to the extent the Losses so agreed are
to be recovered in whole or in part directly from the Indemnifying Parties,
the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly,

 



84  but in no event later than five (5) Business Days, jointly and severally
cause to be paid to Parent an amount equal to the Losses so agreed _minus_ the
portion of the Losses actually deducted from the Escrow Account.

(ii) Should Parent and the Seller be unable to agree as to any particular item
or items or amount or amounts specified in an Objection Certificate within
the time periods specified in _Section 7.5(d)(i)_ , then the Parent
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with  _Section 9.6_. Upon resolution of
such dispute, or receipt of a final non-appealable order or determination from
a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth the resolution of such
dispute, then, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Escrow Account,
an amount equal to the Losses so determined or the applicable portion thereof
as determined by Parent, and to the extent the Losses so determined are to be
recovered in whole or in part directly from the Indemnifying Parties, the
Indemnifying Parties shall promptly, but in no event later than five (5)
__Business Days, jointly and severally cause to be paid to Parent an amount
equal to the Losses so determined _minus_ the portion of the Losses so
determined actually deducted from the Escrow Account.

7.6 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow_. From and after the Closing, the Indemnifying Parties agree that,
subject to the other provisions of this  _Article VII_, the Escrow Account
shall be available to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses in respect of which
such Parent Indemnified Parties may be indemnified, defended or held harmless
under _Section 2.7_ and this _Article VII_. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall not be available to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all Losses in respect of which such Parent Indemnified Parties
may be indemnified, defended or held harmless under Item 1 of _Schedule
7.2(a)(vii)_ until the entire Applicable State Taxes Escrow Amount has been
paid to the Parent Indemnified Parties.

(b) _Satisfaction of Claims_. Recovery against the Indemnification Escrow
Amount contained in the Escrow Account shall be the Parent Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive remedy for indemnification claims under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_, except in the case of Losses arising out of or resulting from a
breach or inaccuracy of the Specified Representations or fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct (with respect to which the limitations
set forth in this sentence shall not apply) and under _Section 7.2(a)(x)_.

 

(c) _Escrow Periods; Distribution Upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject
to the following requirements, the Escrow Amount shall be deposited by Parent
with the Escrow Agent on the Closing Date. Any amounts remaining in the Escrow
Account on the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (less
any amount necessary to satisfy any unresolved claims specified in any Claim
Certificate that is delivered to the Seller prior to the Escrow Release Date
with respect to facts and circumstances existing on or prior to the Escrow
Release Date), shall be released to Seller by the Escrow Agent on the fifth
(5th) Business Day following the date that is eighteen (18) __ months from
the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date"). On the Escrow Release Date, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Seller an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the remaining Escrow Amount not required to satisfy any then
pending claims against the Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for the benefit of the Indemnifying

 



85  Parties. Following resolution of all claims specified in any Claim
Certificate that is delivered to the Seller prior to the Escrow Release Date,
the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Seller an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the remaining Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties.

 

7.7 _Seller as Agent_. __

 

(a) The Indemnifying Parties hereby irrevocably appoint the Seller as their
agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each of the Indemnifying
Parties, in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which shall include the power
and authority:

(i) for the purposes of _Article VII_ , to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to any Parent Indemnified Party of cash
from the Escrow Account in satisfaction of claims by a Parent Indemnified
Party, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
bring suit and comply with orders and awards of courts with respect to such
claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Seller for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Seller shall inform
the other Indemnifying Parties within three (3) Business Days of any action
taken by it hereunder.

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby as the Seller, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or
desirable;

(iii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of all Indemnifying
Parties arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement,
and any other document contemplated hereby, and to take any and all actions
which the Seller believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement
for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties;

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Indemnifying Parties or any
of them and/or the Seller arising out of or under or in any manner relating to
this Agreement or any document contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such failure to act on the part of the Seller, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or
interest by the Seller or by the Indemnifying Parties unless such waiver is in
writing signed by the waiving party or by the Seller; and

 

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Seller, in its sole
and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient
in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and all other documents contemplated hereby.

(b) The Seller may resign as the agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf
of each of the other Indemnifying Parties upon written notice to Parent and
the Key Stakeholders shall appoint a successor. The successor shall be
entitled to all the rights, powers, immunities and privileges as was his or
her predecessor, without the need of any further act or writing. Notices or
communications to or from the Seller shall constitute notice to or from each
of the Key Stakeholders.

 



86 (c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller with respect to the
matters regarding  _Article VII_ , including the Escrow Account contemplated
by _Section 7.6_, shall constitute a decision of all of the Indemnifying
Parties and shall be final, binding and conclusive on all the Indemnifying
Parties, and the Parent Indemnified Parties may rely upon any such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Seller as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each Indemnifying Party. The Parent Indemnified Parties are
hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller.

(d) Parent, on behalf of all Parent Indemnified Parties, hereby agrees that
any notice, right, or obligation required to be delivered to, performed by, or
asserted by the Indemnifying Parties regarding the Escrow Account shall be
delivered to, performed by or asserted by the Seller.

7.8 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payments pursuant to this _Article VII_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

7.9 _Indemnity as Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except in connection with any
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct or for any claim
for specific performance or other equitable remedies after the Closing, this
_Article VII_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for
monetary damages with respect to any and all breaches of any agreement,
covenant, representation or warranty made by such other party in this
Agreement.

the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations of the other, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to the other contained

terminated and the Merger abandoned by authorized action taken by the
terminating party, whether before or after the Shareholder Approval is
obtained:

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by Parent and the Board;

Closing shall not have occurred on or before June 16, 2017 or such other date
that Parent and the Company

 



87  may agree upon in writing (the "Termination Date"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event the condition set forth in _Section 2.4(b)(viii)_ and
_Section 2.4(c)(v)_ shall not have been satisfied on or prior to the
Termination Date, but all other conditions set forth in _Section 2.4_ shall
have been satisfied, or are capable of being satisfied (or have been waived by
the party or parties then entitled to give such waiver) on or prior to the
Termination Date, then the Termination Date shall be extended without further
action by the parties to September 16, 2017; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 8.3(b)_ shall not be available
to any party whose breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation hereunder
will have been the principal cause of, or will have directly resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other, if any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order,
decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining,
restraining, conditioning or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the

injunction or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable or there shall
be adopted any applicable Law that makes the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited;

(d) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if (i) there shall have been
an inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by, or a breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of, the Company, the Seller or the Key
Stakeholders herein and such inaccuracy or breach shall not have been cured
within five (5) __Business Days after receipt by the Company of written
notice of such inaccuracy or breach and, if not cured within such period and
at or prior to the Closing, such inaccuracy or breach would result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ to be
satisfied ( _provided_ that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach that by its nature cannot be cured), (ii) there
shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company, (iii)
__ the Company, the Seller or the Key Stakeholders shall have breached
_Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, or (iv) __Parent does not receive the
Written Consent duly executed by the Seller within one (1) __ hour following
the execution of this Agreement.

inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by, or a breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of, Parent or MergerCo herein and such
inaccuracy or breach shall not have been cured within five (5) Business Days
after receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company of such inaccuracy
or breach and, if not cured within such period and at or prior to the Closing,
such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 2.4(c)_ to be satisfied ( _provided_ that no such cure period shall
be available or applicable to any such inaccuracy or breach that by its nature
cannot be cured).

 

8.4 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 8.3_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and

( _Expenses; Change in Control Payments_ ), this _Section 8.4_ ( _Effect of

9.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be enforceable against the parties actually
executing such counterparts, and all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. A facsimile, telecopy, PDF or other reproduction of this Agreement
may be executed by one or more parties hereto and delivered by such party
by facsimile or any similar electronic transmission device pursuant to which
the signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen. Any such facsimile,
telecopy, PDF or other reproduction shall be deemed an original. Such
execution and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for
all purposes. At the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to
execute and deliver an original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile,
telecopy or other reproduction hereof.

 

9.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Related
Agreements and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein: (a) __constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior

be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign
its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates as
long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parent s obligations
hereunder.

 

9.4 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.6 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that

 



90  might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof, provided that the Merger, and such other provisions of this Agreement
expressly required by the terms of this Agreement to be governed by the CCC,
shall be governed by the CCC. Subject to _Article VII_ hereof, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
any court within Wilmington, Delaware, in connection with any matter based
upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein,
agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the
laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not

party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except
in such courts.

9.7 _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the other party may be
irreparably harmed and that there may be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, including the confidentiality obligations set forth in _Section
6.3_. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements, each
party hereto shall have the right to seek injunctive relief to restrain a
breach or threatened breach of, or otherwise obtain specific performance
of, the other partys covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall inure exclusively to
the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors, assigns, executors and legal representatives. Except as set forth

intended to confer on any person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successor and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

9.10 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. Each of the parties agrees to provide all
such information and documentation as to themselves as requested by Parent to
ensure compliance with applicable law.

9.11 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules identified in this

9.12 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent, MergerCo, the Company, and the Key Stakeholders
acknowledge that the Seller and Company have retained Hopkins and Carley
("Hopkins") to act as their counsel in connection with the Transactions, that
Hopkins has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
Transactions, and that no other Party or Person has the status of a client of
Hopkins for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.

 



91 (b) Each of the Parent, MergerCo, the Company and the Key Stakeholders hereby
(a) waives, on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates any claim
they have or may have that Hopkins has a conflict of interest in connection
with, or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in, such representation; (b)
agrees that, in the event a dispute arises after the Closing between the
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) and the Seller, the
Key Stakeholders, or any of the respective Affiliates, Hopkins may represent
the Seller and the Key Stakeholders in such dispute even though the interest
of any such parties may be directly adverse to the Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company), and even though Hopkins may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 

(c) Each of the Parent, MergerCo, the Company, the Seller, and the Key
Stakeholders, for themselves and their respective Affiliates (including, as
applicable, the Company), further agree that, as to all pre-Closing
communications between or among Hopkins, the Company, the Seller, and/or the
Key Stakeholders that relate in any way to the Transactions, the attorney-
client privilege and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to
the Seller and the Key Stakeholders, and may be controlled by the Seller and
the Key Stakeholders, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Parent or
any of its Affiliates or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises between the Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third Person other than a Party
or any third-party beneficiary to this Agreement after the Closing, on the
other hand, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Hopkins to such third party.

 

9.13 _No Reliance_. Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Key
Stakeholder is making any representations or warranties with respect to, and
Parent is not relying on, any projections or forecasts of future revenue,
future results of operations or future financial condition of the Company.
Neither the Company¸ the Seller nor any Key Stakeholder is making
any representation or warranty, express or implied, of any nature whatsoever
with respect to the Company (including the Assets of the Company or any
projections or forecasts relating to the Company or its business), except for
any representations or warranties of the Seller, the Company or any Key
Stakeholder set forth in this Agreement, or in any agreement, exhibit,
schedule or certificate delivered by Seller, the Company or any Key
Stakeholder under or pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
otherwise restrict: (a) the Liability or obligation of any Person for any
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct committed by such
Person or of any Person who was actually aware of any such fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful misconduct; (b) __the ability of any Parent
Indemnified Party to bring or prosecute any action or claim in connection with
any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct (and to use
any information or documents in connection therewith); or (c) __any Parent
Indemnified Party s rights under any other agreement entered into in
connection with this Agreement.
