2.7 _Distribution of the Verizon Shares following a Share Purchase
Closing_. The provisions of this _Section 2.7_ shall apply if the
Transaction is implemented by way of the Share Purchase, but not if it is
implemented by way of the Vodafone Scheme. As soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement and the selection of the Distribution Agent, the
parties shall discuss with Vodafones registrar and the Distribution Agent the
method pursuant to which the parties will accomplish the prompt and efficient
distribution of the Verizon Shares to the Vodafone Distribution Record
Holders in accordance with Law, Vodafones articles of association and market
practice. In the absence of agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
parties will take the actions specified in clauses  _(a)_ - _(d)_ of this
_Section 2.7_.

 



21 (a) _Distribution Agent_. Prior to the Share Purchase Closing, Vodafone shall
enter into an agreement (the " _Distribution Agent Agreement_ ") with such
bank, trust company or other appropriate service provider as may be mutually
agreed by Verizon and Vodafone (the " _Distribution Agent_ "), which
agreement shall provide that Verizon shall deposit the Verizon Shares pursuant
to the Vodafone Direction Letter, with the Distribution Agent on the Share
Purchase Closing, for the benefit of the holders of the Vodafone ordinary
shares, par value 11 and 3/7ths cents per share (the " _Vodafone Ordinary
Shares_ ") as of the close of business on a date determined by the Board of
Directors of Vodafone (such date, the " _Vodafone Distribution Record Date_ "
and such holders as of the Vodafone Distribution Record Date, the " _Vodafone
Distribution Record Holders_ "), for distribution in accordance with this
_Section 2.7_.

 

(b) _Distribution Procedures_. Vodafone shall, if necessary to effect the
distribution of the Verizon Shares required by this _Section 2.7(b)_,
declare such a dividend as shall enable such distribution to be effected
Lawfully and shall instruct the Distribution Agent to distribute, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Share Purchase Closing, to each Vodafone
Distribution Record Holder that number of whole shares of Verizon Common Stock
representing such Vodafone Distribution Record Holders Pro Rata Portion of
the Verizon Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to 
_Section 2.7(c)_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on the Verizon
Shares or any cash payable to the Vodafone Distribution Record Holders
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. " _Pro Rata Portion_ " means
the percentage obtained by dividing (i) the number of Vodafone Ordinary
Shares owned by a Vodafone Distribution Record Holder by (ii) the total number
of Vodafone Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as of the Vodafone
Distribution Record Date.

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no fractional shares of Verizon Common Stock shall be distributed to Vodafone
Distribution Record Holders, and any such fractional share interests to which
a Vodafone Distribution Record Holder would otherwise be entitled shall not
entitle such Vodafone Distribution Record Holder to vote or to any other
rights as a stockholder of Verizon. In lieu of any such fractional shares,
each Vodafone Distribution Record Holder who, but for the provisions of this
_Section 2.7(c)_, would be entitled to receive a fractional share interest
of Verizon Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, shall be paid cash,
without any interest thereon, as hereinafter provided. Vodafone shall instruct
the Distribution Agent to determine the number of whole shares and fractional
shares of Verizon Common Stock allocable to each Vodafone Distribution Record
Holder, to aggregate all such fractional shares into whole shares, to sell the
whole shares obtained thereby in the open market at the then-prevailing prices
on behalf of each Vodafone Distribution Record Holder who otherwise would be
entitled to receive fractional share interests and to distribute to each such
Vodafone Distribution Record Holder his, her or its ratable share of the total
proceeds of such sale, after making appropriate deductions of the amounts
required for Tax withholding purposes and after deducting any applicable
transfer Taxes and the costs and expenses of such sale and distribution,
including brokers fees and commissions. The sales of fractional shares shall
occur as soon after the Share Purchase Closing as practicable and as
determined by the Distribution Agent. None of Verizon, Vodafone or the
Distribution Agent shall guarantee any minimum sale price for the
fractional shares of

 



22  Verizon Common Stock. None of Verizon, Vodafone or the Distribution Agent
shall pay any interest on the proceeds from the sale of fractional shares. The
Distribution Agent shall have the sole discretion to select the broker-
dealers through which to sell the aggregated fractional shares and to
determine when, how and at what price to sell such shares. Neither the
Distribution Agent nor the broker-dealers through which the
aggregated fractional shares are sold shall be Affiliates of Verizon or
Vodafone.

(d) _Unclaimed Stock or Cash_. Any Verizon Common Stock or cash in lieu of
fractional shares with respect to Verizon Common Stock that remain unclaimed
by any Vodafone Distribution Record Holder one (1) year after the Share
Purchase Closing Date shall be delivered to Vodafone. Vodafone shall hold
such Verizon Common Stock for the account of such Vodafone Distribution Record
Holder and the parties agree that all obligations to provide such Verizon
Common Stock and cash, if any, in lieu of fractional share interests shall
be obligations of Vodafone, subject in each case to applicable escheat or
other abandoned property Laws, and Verizon shall have no Liability with
respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, Vodafone shall have no right to
vote any such unclaimed shares of Verizon Common Stock on behalf of any
Vodafone Distribution Record Holder.

2.8 _Withholding_. Verizon shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement, such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under any Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment; _provided_ , that Verizon shall notify and consult
with Vodafone prior to making any such withholding or deduction. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding were made.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VODAFONE

 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter
delivered to Verizon on or prior to entering into this Agreement (the "
_Vodafone Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item
in any part of the Vodafone Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other part to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), Vodafone hereby makes the following representations and warranties
(a) on the date hereof and (b) on the Measurement Time (except in either case
to the extent such representation is made as of an earlier date (in which
case on and as of such earlier date)):

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Vodafone is a public limited company
duly incorporated and validly existing under the Laws of England and has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
Seller and each Sold Entity is duly organized, validly existing in good
standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing) and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it

 



23  is now being conducted. Each of Seller and each Sold Entity is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties or assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except for such failures to be
so licensed, qualified or in good standing as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Vodafone Material
Adverse Effect. Vodafone has filed with the SEC a correct and complete copy of
its articles of association, as in force at the date of this Agreement, and
made available to Verizon correct and complete copies of the organizational
documents (including the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
comparable documents) of each of Seller and each Sold Entity, in each case as
amended to the date of this Agreement.

3.2 _Authority_.

 

(a) Each of Vodafone and Seller has the requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the approvals
set out in _Section 3.2(c)_ below, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and such execution, delivery and, subject to obtaining
the approvals set out in _Section 3.2(c)_ below, consummation have been duly
authorized by all necessary action. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Vodafone and Seller and, assuming the due execution and delivery
by Verizon, constitutes the valid and binding obligation thereof,
enforceable against Vodafone and Seller in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency and similar federal and state Laws generally
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and general principles of
equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

(b) The Board of Directors of Vodafone, at a meeting duly called and held on
September 1, 2013, has (i) approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and (ii) resolved
to make the Vodafone Recommendation and to include the Vodafone
Recommendation in the Vodafone Circular (subject to _Section 5.3(d)_)
substantially on the following terms:

 

"The Board considers that the [Proposals] are in the best interests of
Vodafone Shareholders as a whole and accordingly unanimously recommends that
all Vodafone Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme of Arrangement at the
Court Meeting and the Resolutions at the Vodafone Shareholders Meeting, as the
Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
The Vodafone Board, which has been so advised by Goldman Sachs and UBS,
considers the terms of the [Transactions] to be fair and reasonable so far as
the Vodafone Shareholders are concerned. In providing financial advice to the
Vodafone Board, Goldman Sachs and UBS have each taken into account the
commercial assessments of the Directors."

(c) (i) The approval of the Vodafone Scheme at the Court Meeting and the
passing of the Vodafone Resolutions at a duly convened and held general
meeting of Vodafone (the " _Vodafone Shareholders Meeting_ "), in each case by
the requisite majority (the " _Vodafone Requisite Scheme Vote_ "), are the
only votes of the holders of any class or

 



24  series of the equity interests of Vodafone necessary to approve and
consummate the Transaction by way of the Vodafone Scheme as contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) the approval of the Vodafone Sale Resolutions at the
Vodafone Shareholders Meeting by the requisite majority (the " _Vodafone
Requisite Share Purchase Vote_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of the equity interests of Vodafone necessary to approve and
consummate the Transaction by way of the Share Purchase as contemplated by
this Agreement.

3.3 _Consents_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Vodafone nor the execution and delivery of the Omnitel Purchase Agreement by
Vodafone Europe, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Reorganization) or thereby, will (a) conflict with, or result
in any breach or violation of, any provision of the organizational documents
of Vodafone, Seller, Vodafone Europe, Omnitel or any of the Sold Entities; (b)
constitute, with or without notice or the passage of time or both, a breach,
violation or default, create an Encumbrance, or give rise to any right of
termination, modification, cancellation, prepayment or acceleration, under any
order, writ, injunction, decree, Law, statute, rule or regulation,
governmental permit or license, or any mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement
or other instrument of Vodafone, Seller, Vodafone Europe, Omnitel or the Sold
Entities or to which Vodafone, Seller, Vodafone Europe, Omnitel or the
Sold Entities or any of their respective assets or properties are subject,
except in each case which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Vodafone Material Adverse Effect; or (c)
require any consent, approval, or authorization of, waiver by, notification
to, or filing with, any Governmental Entity on the part of Vodafone, Seller,
Vodafone Europe, Omnitel or the Sold Entities other than (i) the filing of
certificates and other documents with respect to the Reorganization
transaction contemplated in _Schedule 5.1_ hereto, (ii) filings with the FCC
or in connection with the transactions contemplated in the Omnitel Purchase
Agreement and (iii) such other consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers,
notifications or filings the failure of which to be obtained or made would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Vodafone
Material Adverse Effect.

(a) As of the Closing Date and following completion of the Reorganization,
there will be no Liabilities of any Sold Entity of any kind, other than

Sold Entity. As of the most recent Dividend Payment Date, there were
no accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to the VAI Preferred Shares.

3.5 _Litigation_. There are no (a) investigations or proceedings pending (or,
to the Knowledge of Vodafone, threatened) by any Governmental Entity with

their respective properties at law or in equity before, and there are no

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Vodafone Material Adverse
Effect.

3.6 _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_.

 

(a) The businesses of the Sold Entities are not being conducted in violation
of any applicable Law, except for violations that would not reasonably be

the definition of "Verizon Material Adverse Effect").

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Vodafone, no event

of any Sold Entity under, any permits, licenses, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions
and orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity (" _Licenses_ ") or has
caused (or would cause) an applicable Governmental Entity to fail or refuse to
issue, renew or extend any License (in each case, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both), in each case except for violations, breaches,
defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that would not reasonably be

Material Adverse Effect (disregarding, for purposes of this _Section
3.6(b)_, clause (i) of the definition of "Verizon Material Adverse Effect").

 

(c) None of Vodafone, Seller or any Sold Entity is an "investment company" as
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Encumbrances other than transfer restrictions under applicable securities
Laws. There are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character under which Vodafone or a Sold
Entity is or may become obligated to issue or sell, or giving any Person
other than a Sold Entity a right to subscribe for or acquire, or in any way

Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of them and all such filed Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects; and (ii) have
timely paid all material amounts of Taxes due and payable except, in each
case, to the extent that such Taxes are being contested in good faith or are

representation is made with respect to the accuracy of any such filed

 



27  Tax Return with respect to information reported to the Sold Entities by the
Partnership on Schedule K-1 (IRS Form 1065). There are no material liens with

thereto is declared effective under the Securities Act or first mailed or
posted to shareholders and/or, as applicable, published, contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The

current, future or contingent Liability, neither Vodafone nor any of its
Subsidiaries beneficially owns directly or indirectly, any shares of Verizon

with, all Laws applicable to the Vodafone Benefit Plans and their terms, (ii)
each Vodafone Benefit Plan has been maintained, funded and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, and (iii) insofar as
relates to any Vodafone Benefit Plan operated in the UK which provides pension
benefits other than on a money purchase basis (each such plan, a " _Vodafone

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VERIZON

 

Except as set forth in the Verizon SEC Documents filed with the SEC after
December 31, 2011 and prior to the date hereof (excluding, in each case, any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section to
the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature) or in the corresponding sections of the
disclosure letter delivered to Vodafone on or prior to entering into this
Agreement (the " _Verizon Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any part of the Verizon Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other part to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent), Verizon hereby makes the following
representations and warranties (a) on the date hereof and (b) on the
Measurement Time (except in either case to the extent such representation is
made as of an earlier date (in which case on and as of such earlier date)):

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) Each of Verizon and its Significant Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize the concept of good standing) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized and has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except, in the case of
the Significant Subsidiaries of Verizon, for such failures to be so organized,
existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Verizon Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Verizon and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
the concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Verizon Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Verizon has filed with the SEC correct and complete copies of its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws (the " _Verizon Charter Documents_
"), in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. All such Verizon
Charter Documents are in full force and effect and Verizon is not in
violation of any of their provisions.

4.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Verizon consists of 4,250,000,000 shares

issued and outstanding, 

 



30  (ii) 105,878,296 shares of Verizon Common Stock were issued and held in
treasury, (iii) 117,180,785 shares of Verizon Common Stock were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, the vesting or lapse
of restrictions of restricted share units to acquire shares of Verizon Common

instruments into Verizon Common Stock and (iv) no shares of Verizon Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding. All of the Verizon Common Stock (A) has
been duly authorized and validly issued, (B) is fully paid and nonassessable
and (C) was issued in compliance with all applicable Laws concerning the

were no other equity interests of Verizon issued, authorized or outstanding.
In the event that the Verizon Certificate of Incorporation is amended to
provide for an increase in the number of shares of Verizon Common Stock
authorized by the Verizon Certificate of Incorporation (a " _Verizon
Certificate Amendment_ "), the authorized capital stock of Verizon will
be increased by the number of newly authorized shares of Verizon Common Stock
provided for thereupon.

(b) Other than pursuant to the Verizon Stock Plans, as of the date hereof,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character under which Verizon is or may
become obligated to issue or sell, or giving any Person a right to subscribe
for or acquire, or in any way dispose of, any equity interests of Verizon, or
any securities or obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible
into, any equity interests of Verizon, and no securities or obligations
evidencing such rights are authorized, reserved for issuance, issued, or
outstanding. Upon issuance, the Verizon Shares will not be subject to any
voting trust agreement or other contract, agreement or arrangement restricting
or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or disposition of such
equity interests.

 

4.3 _Authority_.

generally affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

(b) The Board of Directors of Verizon, at a meeting duly called and held,

thereof to approve the Share Issuance (the " _Verizon Requisite Vote_ ") is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the equity interests
of Verizon necessary to approve and consummate the Transaction.

3.02 of the Loan Facility (or, in respect of certainty of funding, such
substantially equivalent conditions (or conditions that are more favorable to
Verizon) as may appear in any Replacement Financing Document), Verizon does
not have any reason to believe that the funds necessary for the payment of the
Cash Consideration, and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
payment of all related fees and expenses, will not be available to Verizon on

Subsidiaries.

 

4.17 _Opinions of Verizon Financial Advisors_. The Board of Directors of
Verizon has received the opinion of each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and
Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC (collectively, the " _Verizon Financial Advisors_
"), dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, and
subject to the various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the
Purchase Price to be paid by Verizon is fair, from a financial point of view,
to Verizon (the " _Verizon Fairness Opinions_ ").

Verizon Benefit Plan, none of Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries beneficially
owns directly or indirectly, any ordinary shares of Vodafone or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for Vodafone

is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity
interest of Vodafone.

5.1 _Reorganization_. Prior to the Closing, Vodafone shall, and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates to, take all actions and to do, or cause its
controlled Affiliates to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Law to effect a pre-closing reorganization consisting of the transactions set
forth on _Schedule 5.1_ in all material respects in the manner set forth
therein (such transactions, together with any modifications made pursuant to
the following sentence of this _Section 5.1_, collectively, the "
_Reorganization_ "), such that (a) at and following the Closing, the only
shares or other equity or partnership interests held (directly or indirectly)
by Vodafone Finance 1 shall be shares of, or equity or partnership interests
in, a Sold Entity or in the Partnership, (b) Verizon shall not acquire,
directly or indirectly, any assets of the Sold Entities, other than those
assets set forth in clauses (i)  (iii) of the first sentence of _Section
3.4(b)_ (all such assets, other than those assets of the Sold Entities set
forth in clauses (i)  (iii) of _Section 3.4(b)_, the " _Excluded Assets_ "),
and (c) Verizon shall not assume or be responsible, directly or indirectly
(including by virtue of the acquisition of any entity), for any Liabilities
of the Sold Entities other than those Liabilities of the Sold Entities set
forth in clauses (i)  (iii) of _Section 3.4(a)_ (all such Liabilities, other
than those Liabilities set forth in clauses (i)  (iii) of _Section 3.4(a)_,
the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "). Vodafone may modify the transactions set

(i) other than in any _de minimis_ respect, impair or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents,
(ii) cause a breach of any representation or warranty of Vodafone made in
this Agreement or (iii) other than in any _de minimis_ respect, increase the

Vodafone is not responsible. Vodafone shall notify Verizon in writing of any
changes to the Reorganization reasonably in advance of effecting any modified
step of the Reorganization and shall consider in good faith any comments
received from Verizon.

5.2 _Proxy Statement, Verizon Registration Statement and Verizon UK
Prospectus_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement but
subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, Verizon shall prepare and file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC. Verizon and Vodafone will cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Vodafone will furnish to Verizon in writing the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Verizon shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after
receipt thereof and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Verizon shall as
soon as reasonably practicable notify Vodafone of the receipt of any comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC
for any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and
shall provide Vodafone with copies of all such comments and correspondence.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or

 



40  supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect thereto, Verizon shall provide Vodafone a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.
Each of Vodafone and Verizon agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it in writing for use in the Proxy Statement which such party
shall have become aware is false or misleading. For the avoidance of doubt,
Vodafone shall not, and nothing in this Agreement shall require Vodafone to,
be responsible for the Proxy Statement other than with respect to the
information provided in writing by Vodafone specifically for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement.

(b) Verizon, acting through the Verizon Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof), shall (i) whether or not there shall have been a Verizon Change of
Recommendation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, take all action necessary to set a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of approving the Share Issuance (the " _Verizon
Stockholders Meeting_ "), (ii) unless there has been a Verizon Change of
Recommendation, include in the Proxy Statement the Verizon Recommendation and
(iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Verizon Requisite
Vote.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement but
subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, Verizon shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the issuance, and, as
appropriate, the distribution to Vodafone Shareholders, of the Verizon Shares
(the " _Verizon Registration Statement_ "). Verizon and Vodafone will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Verizon Registration
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Vodafone will
furnish to Verizon in writing the information relating to it required by the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Verizon Registration Statement. Verizon shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to
the Verizon Registration Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable
after receipt thereof and to have the Verizon Registration Statement declared
effective by the staff of the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing and keep the Verizon Registration Statement effective for so long
as necessary to consummate the Transaction. Verizon shall as soon as
reasonably practicable notify Vodafone of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC with respect to the Verizon Registration Statement and any request by the
SEC for any amendment to the Verizon Registration Statement or for additional
information and shall provide Vodafone with copies of all such comments and
correspondence. Prior to filing the Verizon Registration Statement or
mailing the Verizon US Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
thereto, Verizon shall provide Vodafone a reasonable opportunity to review and
to propose comments on such document or response. Each of Vodafone and
Verizon agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it in writing
for use in the Verizon Registration Statement which such party shall have
become aware is false or misleading. Following its filing and/or mailing,
Verizon undertakes that it shall not (and shall not seek to) withdraw the
Verizon Registration Statement on the grounds that there is an exemption from
a requirement to register the issuance of the 

 



41  Verizon Shares pursuant to the Securities Act. For the avoidance of doubt,
Vodafone shall not, and nothing in this Agreement shall require Vodafone to,
be responsible for the Verizon Registration Statement other than with respect
to the information provided in writing by Vodafone specifically for inclusion
in the Verizon Registration Statement.

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement but
subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, Verizon shall prepare a prospectus as required
by FSMA (the " _Verizon UK Prospectus_ ") in connection with the admission of
the Verizon Shares to listing on the Official List in accordance with the
Listing Rules and to trading on the LSE in accordance with paragraph 3 of the
LSEs admission and disclosure standards (the " _Verizon UK Admission_ ").
Verizon and Vodafone will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Verizon UK Prospectus. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Vodafone will furnish to Verizon in writing the information relating to it
required by the FSMA and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to
be set forth in the Verizon UK Prospectus. Verizon shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve all UKLA comments with respect to the Verizon UK
Prospectus as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to
have the Verizon UK Prospectus cleared by the UKLA as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Verizon shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Vodafone of the receipt of any comments from the UKLA with
respect to the Verizon UK Prospectus and any request by the UKLA for any
amendment to the Verizon UK Prospectus or for additional information and
shall provide Vodafone with copies of all such comments and correspondence.
Prior to posting and publishing (as applicable) the Verizon UK Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto), Verizon shall provide Vodafone a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document.
Each of Vodafone and Verizon agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it in writing for use in the Verizon UK Prospectus which
such party shall have become aware is false or misleading. For the avoidance
of doubt, Vodafone shall not, and nothing in this Agreement shall require
Vodafone to, be responsible for the Verizon UK Prospectus other than with
respect to the information provided in writing by Vodafone specifically for
inclusion in the Verizon UK Prospectus. For the avoidance of doubt, if Verizon
so elects, it may combine the prospectus forming a part of the Verizon
Registration Statement (the " _Verizon US Prospectus_ ") together with the
Verizon UK Prospectus into a joint document intended to satisfy the rules and
regulations applicable to both documents.

 

(e) Verizon and Vodafone shall, following the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing, discuss in good faith the possibility of offering a
"mix and match" facility through appropriate service providers to enable
Vodafone Shareholders (other than Vodafone Shareholders located in certain
restricted jurisdictions) to elect to vary the proportion in which such
Vodafone Shareholders receive Verizon Shares and cash in respect of their
entitlements pursuant to the Vodafone Scheme. Verizon shall also (i) implement
a free share dealing facility through one or more appropriate service
providers, to enable Vodafone Shareholders (other than Vodafone Shareholders
located in certain restricted jurisdictions to be set out in more detail in
the Vodafone Circular) holding fewer than 50,000 Vodafone Ordinary Shares in
Vodafone to elect to sell the Verizon Shares to which they are entitled
pursuant to the terms of the Vodafone Scheme and receive the proceeds of such
sale in cash and in such manner as enables such

 



42  Vodafone Shareholders, without charge, to elect to receive such proceeds
either in USD, GBP or EUR, such free share dealing facility to be provided for
a period of six weeks from the Closing Date; _provided_ , that Vodafone shall
pay on demand to Verizon fifty percent (50%) of all costs and expenses
incurred by Verizon in connection with the implementation of the free share
dealing pursuant to this clause (i), and (ii) implement such arrangements
with one or more appropriate service providers (A) as may be reasonably
necessary to enable Vodafone Shareholders to hold Crest Depository Instruments
representing underlying Verizon Shares (" _Verizon CDIs_ ") and (B) pursuant
to which such appropriate service provider(s) will act as corporate sponsored
nominee and hold Verizon CDIs for the benefit of certificated Vodafone
Shareholders. Verizon will consult with Vodafone (each acting reasonably and
in good faith) with a view to providing that the terms on which the Verizon
CDIs, corporate sponsored nominee service and dealing facilities are provided
are consistent with market practice for similar facilities in the UK-listed
market, such terms to be detailed in the Vodafone Circular and the Verizon UK
Prospectus.

(f) Except as set forth below in this _Section 5.2(f)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Verizon nor any committee thereof shall withhold or withdraw (or
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Vodafone), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of
Verizon or any such committee thereof with respect to the Share Issuance (such
approval, recommendation or declaration, the " _Verizon Recommendation_ " and
any such withholding, withdrawal, qualification or modification, a " _Verizon
Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to obtaining the Verizon Requisite Vote, the Board of Directors of Verizon may
make a Verizon Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event
if the Verizon Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor, each of nationally recognized reputation)
that the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law requires such
Verizon Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Verizon
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Verizon Change of
Recommendation until after the fourth (4th) Business Day following Vodafones
receipt of written notice (a " _Verizon Change Notice_ ") from Verizon
advising Vodafone that the Verizon Board intends to take such action and (ii)
Verizon shall, throughout such four- (4-) Business Day period, negotiate in
good faith with Vodafone with respect to any revisions to the terms of the
Transaction proposed by Vodafone in response to an Intervening Event. In
determining whether to make a Verizon Change of Recommendation, the Verizon
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Vodafone in response to a Verizon Change Notice or otherwise.

 

5.3 _Vodafone Shareholder Approval, Circular and Reduction of Capital_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following execution of this Agreement
but subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, Vodafone shall:

(i) instruct counsel for the purposes of the Vodafone Scheme;

 



43 (ii) prepare a circular (the " _Vodafone Circular_ ") to its shareholders in
relation to (inter alia) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Vodafone Scheme, and, whether or not there shall have been a Vodafone
Change of Recommendation, convene the Vodafone Shareholders Meeting (subject
to  _Section 5.4(a)_) and, unless Vodafone has withdrawn the Vodafone
Scheme, the Court Meeting to consider and, if thought fit, approve the
Vodafone Resolutions, and, unless there has been a Vodafone Change of
Recommendation, containing the Vodafone Recommendation (whether or not
Vodafone has withdrawn the Vodafone Scheme, provided that in such event such
Vodafone Recommendation shall be in respect of the Vodafone Sale Resolutions

publish the Vodafone Circular, and use commercially reasonable efforts to

(vii) whether or not there shall have been a Vodafone Change of Recommendation
and, with respect to subclauses (A) and (B), below, whether or not the

subject to _Section 5.4(a)_, convene the Vodafone Shareholders Meeting to:

---|---|--- 
 



44 implementation thereof; 
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | approve the issue of the Vodafone Class B Shares and

the " _Vodafone Sale Resolutions_ "); _provided_ , that Vodafone shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to reach a position whereby the Vodafone
Sale Resolutions are proposed for approval at the Vodafone Shareholders
Meeting as a single, composite resolution or failing which, the related party
transaction approvals referred to in (B) above are proposed as a single,
composite resolution;

 

(viii) unless there has been a Vodafone Change of Recommendation, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Vodafone Requisite Scheme Vote
and the Vodafone Requisite Share Purchase Vote;

(ix) apply to the Court for the sanction of the Vodafone Scheme and the
confirmation of the Court of the Vodafone Reduction of Capital; _provided_ ,
that the parties agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize the period between the two hearings of the Court and, subject to
the approval of the Court, have both hearings occur on the same day; provided,
further, that without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the
hearing in respect of the confirmation by the Court of the Vodafone Reduction
of Capital shall (A) not be held on a Friday and (B) be held in the same
calendar week as the Court Hearing; and

 



45 (x) give such reasonable undertakings as may be required by the Court as
a condition to obtaining the Courts sanction of the Vodafone Scheme and
confirmation of the Vodafone Reduction of Capital.

 

(b) Prior to posting or publishing the Vodafone Circular or responding to
comments of the UKLA, Vodafone shall provide Verizon a reasonable opportunity
to review and to propose comments on such document or response and give
reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by Verizon in connection
therewith. Vodafone shall also provide Verizon a reasonable
advance opportunity to review and to propose comments on all documents to be
filed with the Court in connection with the Vodafone Scheme and give
reasonable consideration to all comments proposed by Verizon in connection
therewith.

 

(c) Verizon shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to implement
the Vodafone Scheme and in particular shall (subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions to the Vodafone Scheme):

(i) unless not required by the terms of the Vodafone Scheme, through counsel,
consent at the Court Hearing to be bound by the Vodafone Scheme;

(ii) execute or procure the execution of all such documents, and do or
procure the carrying out of all such actions, as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable to implement the Vodafone Scheme;

 

(iii) give such reasonable undertakings as may be required by the Court as a
condition to obtaining the Courts sanction for the Vodafone Scheme; and

(iv) provide such other assistance (and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to procure that its Affiliates provide such assistance) as Vodafone
may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Vodafone
Circular, the implementation of the Vodafone Scheme or Vodafone Reduction of
Capital and in preparing and obtaining UKLA approval of, and posting or
publishing (as appropriate), any other document in connection with the matters
set out in this _Section 5.3(c)_, including by, subject to applicable Law,
providing information in writing in relation to Verizon, any of its
Affiliates and any of its or their directors or officers;

_provided_ , that Verizon and Vodafone shall, in relation to clauses (i) and
(iii), cooperate with each other to explain fully to the Court the terms of
this Agreement and, in particular, _Sections 8.1(j)_ and _10.6(b)_ , with a
view to assuring the Court that, in the event of a Financing Failure, Verizon
should not be regarded as being in breach of any consent or undertaking that
Verizon is required to give to the Court.

 

(d) Except as set forth below in this _Section 5.3(d)_, neither the Board of
Directors of Vodafone nor any committee thereof shall withhold or withdraw
(or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Verizon) the recommendation by
the Board of Directors of

 



46  Vodafone or any such committee thereof to the Vodafone Shareholders to vote
in favor of each of the Vodafone Resolutions (such recommendation, the "
_Vodafone Recommendation_ " and any such withholding, withdrawal,
qualification or modification, a " _Vodafone Change of Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Vodafone may at any
time prior to obtaining the Vodafone Requisite Share Purchase Vote make a
Vodafone Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors of Vodafone
determines in good faith (in its sole discretion but after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that the exercise of its fiduciary duties as the board of directors of an
English public limited company requires such Vodafone Change of
Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Vodafone shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable and legally permissible (taking into account the date
of the Vodafone Shareholders Meeting) seek to consult with Verizon prior to
exercising its right to make a Vodafone Change of Recommendation. In
determining whether to make a Vodafone Change of Recommendation, the Vodafone
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Verizon during any such consultation. In the event of a Vodafone
Change of Recommendation following the posting of the Vodafone Circular,
Vodafone shall, upon request by Verizon, promptly withdraw the Vodafone Scheme
from the Court.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Vodafone Scheme, Vodafone shall not
reduce the amount of the Cash Entitlement if and to the extent that such
reduction would delay the date on which the Court Hearing would otherwise take
place.

 

5.4 _Cooperation with Respect to Filings and Meetings of Shareholders_.

 

(a) Vodafone and Verizon shall cooperate and consult with each other to co-
ordinate the timing of the preparation, posting or publication of the
relevant documents, convening of the relevant meetings, or the taking of the
other steps required pursuant to _Sections 5.2_ and _5.3_ , and in particular
shall cooperate to ensure that (i) the Proxy Statement is mailed to Verizon
Shareholders, and the Verizon UK Prospectus, the Verizon Registration
Statement (and the prospectus contained therein) and the Vodafone Circular are
mailed or posted to the Vodafone Shareholders and/or, as applicable,
published, on the same date and (ii) the Vodafone Shareholders Meeting, the
Court Meeting and the Verizon Stockholders Meeting are held on the same date
and at substantially the same time.

 

(b) Vodafone agrees that it shall not, without Verizons consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required
by Law, make any amendments to the terms of the Vodafone Scheme which may
adversely affect the rights and obligations of Verizon. Vodafone may, at its
sole discretion, withdraw the Vodafone Scheme at any time prior to or during
the Court Hearing but shall, prior to withdrawing the Vodafone Scheme, consult
with Verizon.

(c) Verizon will procure that Verizon and the directors of Verizon accept
responsibility for all of the information set out in the Verizon UK Prospectus
(but not, for avoidance of doubt, in the Vodafone Circular).

 



47 (d) Vodafone will procure that the directors of Vodafone accept
responsibility for all of the information set out in the Vodafone Circular
(but not, for the avoidance of doubt, in the Verizon UK Prospectus, the
Verizon Registration Statement or any other Verizon Disclosure Document).

 

(e) If there shall occur any event (including discovery of any fact,
circumstance or event) that is required by applicable Law to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Vodafone Circular, the Proxy Statement, the
Verizon Registration Statement, the Verizon US Prospectus or the Verizon UK
Prospectus, Vodafone or Verizon (as applicable) shall prepare and post
or publish (as applicable) such an amendment or supplement or issue a press
release or take other corrective action, in each case to the extent required
by applicable Law, and in each case after, to the extent reasonably
practicable: (i) providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review such amendment or supplement; and (ii) in good faith giving reasonable
consideration to all comments proposed by that other party.

 

(f) Vodafone and Verizon shall cooperate and consult with each other to
determine a mutually satisfactory approach to the treatment of Overseas
Scheme Shareholders. Without limitation of the foregoing, (i) Vodafone shall
not make a determination under paragraphs 11.1(A) or (B) of the Vodafone
Scheme, and Verizon shall not give notice requiring such a determination
pursuant to Section 5.4(g), without prior consultation with the other party
and (ii) Vodafone and Verizon shall attempt to reach an agreement with respect
to the treatment of Overseas Scheme Shareholders prior to the
Vodafone Circular Posting Date.

(g) Without prejudice to _Section 5.4(f)_, Vodafone shall not make the B
Share Election available to Overseas Scheme Shareholders in any jurisdiction,
nor shall Verizon be obliged to issue and deliver Verizon Shares (or procure
the delivery of Verizon CDIs or statements of ownership in respect of Verizon
CDIs) to Overseas Scheme Shareholders in any jurisdiction, if Verizon has
notified Vodafone at least five (5) Business Days before the Court Hearing
that it has determined that doing so is (A) prohibited by applicable Law or
(B) permitted only subject to compliance by Verizon with requirements of
applicable Law (including any requirement to make any registration or filing
with, or obtain any consent or approval from, any Governmental Authority)
which Verizon, in its absolute discretion, considers to be unduly onerous. If
Verizon makes such a notification with respect to a jurisdiction, then
Vodafone shall make such determination under paragraph 11.1(A) or (B) of the
Scheme as is notified by Verizon to Vodafone for these purposes. For
the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be unduly onerous for Verizon to
"passport" the Verizon UK Prospectus from the United Kingdom into any other
Member State in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Prospectus
Directive and the Laws of such Member State.

5.5 _Press Releases_. The forms of the initial press releases regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, to be released as promptly as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement and at substantially the same time,
are attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (the " _Initial Verizon Press Release_ ")
and _Exhibit I_ (the " _Initial Vodafone Press Release_ " and, together with
the Initial Vodafone Press Release, the " _Initial Press Releases_ "). Each of
Verizon and Vodafone

 



48  agrees that, prior to Closing, it will consult with the other prior to
making, or permitting any of their Subsidiaries to make, any public statement
or release concerning this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law or the obligations pursuant to any applicable listing
agreement with or rules of any securities exchange (including, for
avoidance of doubt, the NYSE, the NASDAQ and the LSE); _provided_ , that (a)
to the extent such consultation obligation has been discharged with respect to
the contents of any such public statement or release, no separate consultation
obligation shall apply in respect of such content to the extent replicated in
whole or in part in any subsequent public statement or release and (b) Verizon
and Vodafone may make public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analysts conference calls, so long as any such statements are consistent with
the Initial Press Releases and other prior press releases, public disclosures
or public statements made jointly by Verizon and Vodafone or made by one
party in accordance with this _Section 5.5_ or in the Current Report on Form
8-K filed by Verizon with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and do not reveal material nonpublic information
regarding this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

5.6  _Securityholder Litigation_. Verizon and Vodafone shall, in connection
with the defense or settlement by such party of any actual or threatened
securityholder litigation, complaints or challenges against it or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents (including, for avoidance of doubt, any
actual or threatened litigation, complaints or challenges that may be brought
in the Court or any other court of England and Wales in connection with the
Vodafone Scheme or that otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents), (a) consult and cooperate with the
other party and (b) keep the other party reasonably and timely informed of
developments, changes or occurrences with respect to any such litigation.

5.7 _Confidentiality_. Except as mutually agreed by each of the parties
hereto, each of the parties agrees that, during the term of this Agreement and
at all times thereafter, it will not disclose to any person (other than any
financial advisers, accountants, attorneys, and other Representatives who are
required to know such information) any information that has been made
available to such party in connection with the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, except as required by Law, regulation or
legal process (including necessary disclosure in connection with any legal
process relating to establishing or enforcing any rights under this Agreement)
or in connection with obtaining the approval of any Governmental Entity, and
except that Verizon may disclose this Agreement and the Omnitel Purchase
Agreement to Financing Sources.

5.8 _Approvals, Consents and Regulatory Filings._  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and
do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to satisfy all legal
conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and to obtain all consents,

 



49  orders and approvals of Governmental Entities and non-governmental third
parties that may be or become necessary for the consummation of any of the

each case as soon as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, and each of the parties will cooperate fully with the other parties

authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable after the date hereof
(and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days from the date hereof with
respect to clause (i) below), Verizon shall file or cause the Partnership to
file (i) applications or notices with the FCC necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents, if any, which applications will comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended and the
rules and regulations of the FCC, (ii) applications or notices with each
applicable state public service utility commission or other state or local
regulatory entity necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, if
any, and (iii) any other regulatory consents and approvals necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents. Verizon shall diligently prosecute and cause its
Subsidiaries to diligently prosecute all such applications and take all such
actions and give all such notices as may be required or requested by the FCC
or any other regulatory agency or as may be appropriate in an effort to
expedite the grant of any necessary consent by the FCC or such regulatory
agency. For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, "commercially reasonable efforts"
shall not include nor require any party or any of its Subsidiaries to (A)
sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose
or agree to dispose of any asset, in each case if such sale, separation or
disposition or agreement with respect thereto would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Verizon Material Adverse Effect,
or (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in any particular manner, or
agree to any other condition, requirement, restriction or action, if such
conduct or agreement with respect thereto, or such other condition,
requirement, restriction or action, would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Verizon Material Adverse Effect (each of the
foregoing effects, a " _Burdensome Effect_ "). None of Vodafone or any of its
Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of Verizon, agree to
become subject to, or consent to or otherwise take any action with respect to,
any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a
Governmental Entity in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to the extent such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order would be binding on any Sold Entity or any of its
Affiliates upon or following the Closing.

(b) Except to the extent prohibited by Law and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any investigation or other inquiry before a
Governmental Entity and in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including any proceeding initiated
by a Governmental Entity or a private party; (ii) furnish all information
required 

 



50  or reasonably requested for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents; (iii) keep the
other parties informed in all material respects of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Entities, and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents; (iv)
except for filings made by Vodafone and its Affiliates in connection with
the Reorganization, give the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review
in advance and propose comments with respect to any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents; and (v) except for filings made by Vodafone and its
Affiliates in connection with the Reorganization, provide to the other parties
hereto copies of all filings and material correspondence with all
Governmental Entities with respect to the filings and consents in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials provided to the other parties may be redacted (A) to remove
references to valuation, (B) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, (C) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns and (D) to protect
competitively sensitive information.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of each of the
parties contained in _Sections 5.8(a)_ and  _(b)_ , if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents as violative of any
Law, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction
or administrative order is enacted, entered or promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Entity which would make the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents illegal or otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, each of the parties shall
cooperate in all respects with each of the other parties and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding, to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and to have such statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed, rescinded or made
inapplicable; _provided,_ that the parties shall not be obligated to seek to
overturn a final order by the FCC disapproving the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document under any Law or if
any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents as violative of any Law, 

 



51  each of the parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any such objections or challenges as such Governmental Entity or private party
may have to such transactions under such Law so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

5.9  _Financing_.

(a) Verizon shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the proceeds of, the Financing
and, if applicable, the Replacement Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Documents and Replacement Financing Documents,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) comply with its
obligations and satisfy the conditions precedent to funding under the
Financing Documents and, if applicable, Replacement Financing Documents; (ii)
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 of the Loan
Facility (and/or, in respect of certainty of funding, such substantially
equivalent conditions (or conditions that are more favorable to Verizon)
as may appear in any Replacement Financing Document), consummate the
Financing and, if applicable, the Replacement Financing at or prior to
Closing; and (iii) cause the Financing Sources and, if applicable, Replacement
Financing Sources to fund on the Closing Date the Financing and, if
applicable, the Replacement Financing to the extent required to consummate the
Transaction in accordance with the terms thereof (including, to the extent
commercially reasonable, by promptly taking enforcement action under the
Financing Documents and, if applicable, the Replacement Financing Documents in
the event of a breach by any Financing Sources or Replacement Financing
Sources).

 

(b) Verizon shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
debt (including unsecured notes) or equity offerings for all or any portion
of the Financing or, if applicable, Replacement Financing by reducing
commitments under the Financing and, if applicable, any Replacement Financing;
_provided_ , that to the extent any consummated debt has a scheduled special
or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the
Termination Date. Further, Verizon shall have the right to substitute
commitments in respect of other debt or equity financing for all or any
portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative bona fide third-
party financing sources (" _Replacement Financing Sources_ ") so long as (i)
all conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
debt or equity financing have been satisfied and the conditions precedent to
funding under the debt financing or issuance of the equity financing are, in
respect of certainty of funding, substantially equivalent to (or conditions
that are more favorable to Verizon than) the conditions set forth in Section
3.02 of the Loan Facility, and (ii) in respect of any debt financing, prior to
funding of the loans thereunder, the commitments in respect of such debt
financing are subject to restrictions on assignment which are substantially
equivalent to or more favorable to the Verizon than the restrictions set forth
in Section 8.07 of the Loan Facility (any such debt or equity financing which
satisfies the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Replacement Financing_
"; the definitive documentation for any such Replacement Financing, the "
_Replacement Financing Documents_ ").

 



52 (c) Verizon shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any provision or remedy under, the
Financing Documents or Replacement Financing Documents; _provided_ , that
Verizon shall not, without the prior written consent of Vodafone, at any time
prior to the Closing: (i) permit any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, any
Financing Document or Replacement Financing Document if such amendment,
replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (A) adds any new (or
modifies, in a manner materially adverse to Verizon, any existing) conditions
to the consummation of the Financing or Replacement Financing (as applicable),
(B) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing and the Replacement
Financing other than to the extent that (1) such reduction is required by the
terms of the Loan Facility or (2) Verizon has available to it Replacement
Financing or cash on hand in an amount equal to such reduction, (C)
materially adversely impacts the ability of Verizon to enforce its rights
against other parties to any Financing Document as so amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived, relative to the ability of Verizon to
enforce its rights against such other parties to any Financing Document as in
effect on the date hereof or Replacement Financing Document as in effect on
the date of execution thereof, or (D) prevents, impedes or materially delays
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Verizon may amend
the Financing Documents and/or Replacement Financing Documents to add lenders,
lead arrangers, syndication agents, documentation agents or similar entities
who had not executed any Financing Document and/or Replacement Financing
Document; or (ii) terminate the Loan Facility other than to the extent that
(A) the commitments under the Loan Facility have been reduced to zero in
accordance with its terms or (B) Verizon has obtained Replacement Financing in
an aggregate amount equal to the commitment under the Loan Facility at the
time of such termination of the Loan Facility. Verizon shall promptly
following execution deliver to Vodafone copies of any such amendment,
replacement (including any Replacement Financing Document), supplement,
modification or waiver (which may be redacted to delete any compensation
information). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Verizon agrees that it shall not reduce the aggregate amount of all unfunded
commitments in respect of the Financing and, if applicable, Replacement
Financing (whether as a result of a disposition of assets, debt issuance or
equity issuance but, for the avoidance of doubt, not as a result of the
funding of the loans thereunder) to an amount less than Twenty Billion Dollars
($20,000,000,000) without Vodafones consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Verizon acknowledges and agrees that Vodafone and its Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, the Sold Entities), their respective
Representatives and, prior to the Closing, the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to, any Person under or pursuant
to the Financing or Replacement Financing pursuant to the Financing Documents
or Replacement Financing Documents, if any, and that Verizon shall indemnify
and hold harmless Vodafone and its Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Sold Entities), their respective Representatives and, prior to
the Closing, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in

 



53  connection with the Financing or the Replacement Financing pursuant to the
Financing Documents or Replacement Financing Documents, if any, except to the
extent resulting from any breaches of the representations, warranties or
covenants of Vodafone under this Agreement. Verizon shall keep Vodafone
reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the financing contemplated by the Financing Documents
and Replacement Financing Documents (if any), it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this _Section 5.9(d)_ shall relieve
Vodafone of any liability pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or require Verizon to
provide indemnification in respect of any such liability.

5.10 _Voting Rights; Purchases of Securities_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Verizon shall not, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates not to, purchase any ordinary shares of Vodafone or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for ordinary
shares of Vodafone, and none of Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries shall
purchase any rights to acquire any ordinary shares of Vodafone.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Vodafone shall not, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates not to, purchase any shares of Verizon Common Stock or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for Verizon
Common Stock, and neither Vodafone nor any of its Subsidiaries shall purchase
any rights to acquire any Verizon Common Stock.

 

5.11 _Name Changes_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date but not later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date,
Verizon shall cause the organizational documents of the Sold Entities to be
amended so as not to include any of "Vodafone" or any word, phrase or acronym
confusingly similar thereto and take all such other steps required under
applicable law to change and register the name of the Sold Entities
accordingly.

5.12 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, each party hereto shall at any time and from time to time after the
Closing, upon the request of another party hereto, do, execute, acknowledge
and deliver, and cause to be done, executed, acknowledged or delivered, all
such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances, powers of
attorney or assurances as may be required for (a) the better transferring,
assigning and conveying the equity interests of the Sold Entities to Verizon,
or (b) the transfer, assignation, conveyance and assumption of any Excluded
Assets owned by or Excluded Liabilities of the Sold Entities to Vodafone or
its designated Affiliates following the Closing. Except with respect to a
Verizon Change of Recommendation or a Vodafone Change of Recommendation, no
party hereto shall take any actions that would be reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents. In the event that
Seller fails to perform any covenant, agreement or obligation that it is
obligated to perform pursuant to this Agreement, Vodafone shall cause Seller
to perform such covenant, agreement or obligation.

 



54 5.13 _Access_. Except as determined in good faith to be necessary to comply
with applicable Law, or preserve any applicable privilege (including the
attorney-client privilege), Verizon will cause the Sold Entities and the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries, until the date that is six (6) years after
the Closing Date, and Vodafone will cause the Sold Entities, prior to the
Closing Date, to afford promptly to Vodafone and its Representatives or
Verizon and its Representatives, as applicable, reasonable access to their
books of account, financial, tax and other records, information, employees
and auditors to the extent necessary (a) with respect to Vodafone and its
Representatives, in determining any matter in connection with any audit
relating to the Sold Entities or their Affiliates and the Partnership with
respect to any period ending on or before the Closing Date for purposes of
financial statements of Vodafone or its Affiliates or for the preparation of
any Tax Returns of Vodafone or its Affiliates and (b) with respect to Verizon
and its Representatives, in determining the Tax consequences of the
Transaction; _provided_ , that any such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of Verizon, the Sold Entities, the
Partnership or their respective Affiliates or Vodafone, the Sold Entities and
their Affiliates, as applicable. The party seeking access to information shall
bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees,
but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee
benefits) incurred in connection with obtaining such access. Each party will
hold, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives to hold (and will be responsible for any failure by any of
its Representatives to hold), in confidence all confidential information
concerning the Sold Entities or their Affiliates and the Partnership or its
Affiliates.

 

5.14 _Change in Ownership; ELPI Contribution_.

 

(a) The parties agree that entry into this Agreement and consummation of the
transactions pursuant hereto do not and will not constitute a "Change in
Ownership" for purposes of the Partnership Agreement until the Closing shall
have occurred.

not to, exercise the ELPI Contribution referred to in the ELPI Contribution
Agreement, dated as of December 2001, among the Partnership, Verizon, Vodafone

Entities, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
organizational documents and which, in the case of the Sold Entities, has
prior to the date hereof been made available to Verizon shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect to the extent provided in
the following sentence. Verizon shall cause the Sold Entities and the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries to maintain in effect until the sixth (6th)

in each case in effect as of the date hereof and which, in the case of the
Sold Entities, has been provided to

 



55  Verizon prior to the date hereof, for acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Closing.

 

(b) In the event any of the Sold Entities, the Partnership or its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the applicable Sold Entity, the Partnership or the applicable
Subsidiary of the Partnership shall assume all of the obligations of such
Person contemplated to be maintained pursuant to _Section 5.15(a)_.

(c) As of the Closing, Verizon, for and on behalf of itself, its Affiliates
and their respective successors and assigns (the " _Verizon Releasing Persons_
"), hereby voluntarily, knowingly, fully, unconditionally and irrevocably
acquits, releases and forever discharges each Vodafone Related Party from any

its Subsidiaries or the Sold Entities, other than Claims arising out of or
permitted under the express terms set forth in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents or any agreement, other than the Partnership Agreement,
that is not terminated pursuant to the last sentence of this _Section 5.15_.

that no action by Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
specifically addressed by any

 

provision of subsections (a) through (g) of this _Section 5.17_ shall be
deemed to be a breach of this sentence unless such action would constitute a
breach of such subsection. Without limiting the generality of, and in
furtherance of, the foregoing, from the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as
required by Law or as Vodafone may approve in writing (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as set forth in _Section
5.17 of the Verizon Disclosure Letter_, Verizon will not and will not permit
its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

thereunder at any time on or following the date of this Agreement, (ii) in
connection with the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of an equity interest
in or assets of any Person or any business or division thereof, whether by

TAX MATTERS

6.1 _Tax Returns_.

(a) Vodafone shall prepare, or cause to be prepared (in a manner consistent
with past practices, except as otherwise required by applicable Law), all Tax
Returns of the Sold Entities required to be filed for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period of a Sold Entity (the " _Seller Returns_ "). In the case of any Seller
Return that is required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, Vodafone
shall cause each such Seller Return to be timely filed and shall cause the
amount of Taxes shown as due on such Seller Return to be timely paid. With
respect to any Seller Return filed after the Closing Date, Vodafone shall (i)
provide Verizon with a copy of each such Seller Return at least twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for filing such Seller Return and (ii) consider in
good faith any written comments promptly received from Verizon with respect
to such Seller Return (and, if applicable, revise such Seller Return to
reflect such comments). In the case of any Seller Return that is required to
be filed after the Closing Date, Verizon shall cause the Sold Entities
to timely file such Seller Return received from Vodafone; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Verizon shall not be required to cause such filing if (i)
such Seller Return is not prepared in accordance with this Agreement or (ii)
Verizon reasonably believes that there may not be "substantial authority" (or
such higher standard as may be required under applicable Law to avoid the
imposition of penalties) supporting each material position reflected on such
Seller Return, unless Vodafone provides an opinion reasonably acceptable to
Verizon from a recognized tax advisor to the effect that there is "substantial
authority" (or such higher standard as may be required under applicable Law to
avoid the imposition of penalties) for such position; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the signing and filing of a Seller Return in accordance with
the foregoing provision shall not be considered an acknowledgement that such
Seller Return complies with the requirements of this

 



60  Agreement. Verizon shall pay, or cause the Sold Entities to pay, any Taxes
due with respect to Seller Returns filed in accordance with the preceding
sentence, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including the
next sentence and any indemnity obligation of Vodafone pursuant to _Section
9.2(c)_. Vodafone shall pay to Verizon by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date
for filing any Seller Return required to be filed after the Closing Date the
amount of Taxes shown as due and unpaid on such Seller Return for which
Vodafone is responsible under this Agreement.

 

(b) Verizon shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, when due all Tax Returns (other than Seller Returns) that are required
to be filed by or with respect to the Sold Entities for Straddle Periods of
such entities (the " _Verizon Returns_ "). Verizon shall pay, or cause the
Sold Entities to pay, any Taxes due with respect to any Verizon Returns,
subject to any indemnity obligation of Vodafone pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_.
If any Verizon Return includes any amounts for which Vodafone is liable under
this Agreement (including any indemnity obligation of Vodafone pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_), Verizon shall, at least twenty (20) days prior to the due
date of any such Verizon Return, deliver such Verizon Return to Vodafone for
Vodafones approval (not to be unreasonably withheld,  _provided_ ,
_however,_ that Vodafone may control and direct the manner in which the
Reorganization is reported on such Verizon Return; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Verizon shall not be required to reflect any material position on such
Verizon Return unless, either (i) Verizon reasonably determines that there is
at least "substantial authority" (or such higher standard as may be required
under applicable Law to avoid the imposition of penalties) for such position,
or (ii) Vodafone provides an opinion reasonably acceptable to Verizon from a
recognized tax advisor to the effect that there is "substantial authority" (or
such higher standard as may be required under applicable Law to avoid the
imposition of penalties) for such position; and Vodafone shall pay to Verizon
by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Verizon Return the amount
of Taxes shown as due and unpaid on such Verizon Return for which Vodafone is
responsible under this Agreement.

(c) For purposes of _Section 9.2(c)_, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax related to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any gross receipts,
employment, sales or use, value added, Taxes based upon or measured by
reference to income or gain, and other similar Taxes, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and
included the Closing Date, and (B) in the case of any Tax other than a Tax
described in clause (A) be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

(d) Each Sold Entity that is classified as a partnership for United States
federal income Tax purposes (and, with respect to any Sold Entity that holds
an interest in an entity classified as a partnership for United States federal
income Tax purposes, including

 



61  the Partnership, such other entity) shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as if its taxable year ended as of the end of the Closing Date. The
allocation of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the
Partnership to the Sold Entities for the period ending on the Closing Date
will be determined under the "closing of the books" method; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Closing Date is not on a quarter end, the items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Partnership, other than extraordinary
items, for the portion of the quarter that ends on the Closing Date may be
determined by pro ration of the quarters results, provided that the Tax
Distributions are determined on a basis consistent with such allocation. The
taxable year of each Sold Entity that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes shall, for such purposes, end as of the
end of the Closing Date, and such Sold Entities will become members of
Verizons consolidated group on the day after the Closing Date. The allocation
of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of any Sold Entity that
is treated as a corporation for United States federal income Tax purposes for
the period ending on the Closing Date will be determined under the "closing of
the books" method. To the extent permitted or required under applicable Law,
Vodafone and Verizon agree to take all actions necessary to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Sold Entities for
all Tax purposes.

 

6.2 _Tax Claims_. Vodafone shall, solely at its own cost and expense, have the
right to control all Tax proceedings (and make all decisions relating to such
Tax proceedings) involving a Tax Claim with respect to the Sold Entities for
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , that
Vodafone must provide Verizon with written notice of its election to control
such Tax Claim within twenty (20) days of Verizon (or a Tax Authority)
notifying Vodafone of such Tax Claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
Vodafone shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax proceeding
without the prior written consent of Verizon (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Verizon or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Sold Entities) that is
material. Vodafone shall keep Verizon reasonably informed with respect to the
commencement, status and substantive aspects of any such Tax proceeding. If
Verizon receives notice of a Tax Claim, Verizon shall give notice to Vodafone
in writing of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay by
Verizon to give notice of a Tax Claim shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligation of Vodafone hereunder except to the extent Vodafone is actually
prejudiced thereby. In the case of a Tax proceeding of or with respect to the
Sold Entities for any Straddle Period, the Controlling Party (defined below)
shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own expense, such
Tax proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Controlling Party shall
provide the Non-Controlling Party (defined below) with a timely and reasonably
detailed account of each stage of such Tax proceeding, (ii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party before taking
any significant action in connection with such Tax proceeding, (iii) the
Controlling Party shall consult with the Non-Controlling Party and offer the
Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before submitting any written
materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax proceeding, (iv)
the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax proceeding diligently and in good
faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax
proceeding, (v) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to participate in
such Tax proceeding and attend any meetings or conferences with the relevant
Taxing Authority, and (vi) the Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise
or abandon any such Tax proceeding without obtaining the prior written

 



62  consent of the Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Controlling Party_
" shall mean Vodafone if Vodafone and its Affiliates are reasonably expected
to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax proceeding, or
Verizon if Verizon and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the
greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax proceeding (in each case,
taking into account the provisions of _Section 9.2(c)_ and _Section
9.2(d)_); and " _Non-Controlling Party_ " shall mean whichever of Vodafone or
Verizon is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax proceeding.
Anything in this _Section 6.2_ to the contrary notwithstanding: (i) Verizon
shall, at its sole cost and expense, have the sole right to control any issue
arising in a Tax proceeding of or with respect to any of the Sold Entities
for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle
Period to the extent such issue relates solely to Taxes imposed on a Sold
Entity with respect to any such period for which Vodafone is not responsible
pursuant to the penultimate sentence of _Section 9.2(c_), provided that
Verizon shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax proceeding
without the prior written consent of Vodafone (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Vodafone or any of its
Subsidiaries that is material, including under _Section 9.2(c)_; and (ii)
Vodafone shall, at its sole cost and expense, have the sole right to control
any issue arising in any Tax proceeding of or with respect to any of the Sold
Entities for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a
Straddle Period to the extent such issue relates to the Reorganization (and
to make all decisions relating thereto) _provided_ , that Vodafone shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax proceeding without the prior
written consent of Verizon (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld)
if such settlement, compromise or abandonment would reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Verizon or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing, the Sold Entities) that is material.

 

6.3 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) Vodafone, and Verizon shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in connection with all disputes, audits and other proceedings
relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to each other
all records reasonably requested in connection with Taxes and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder. Vodafone and
Verizon shall further reasonably cooperate, and make their respective
advisors available to each other, with respect to the Tax consequences of the
Reorganization. Vodafone shall cause the Sold Entities to be in possession, at
the Closing (or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in any event within 30
days following the Closing Date), of all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers
and all other material records and documents relating to Tax matters of the
Sold Entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to,
or including, the Closing Date. At Verizons written request, Vodafone shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Verizon at or prior to the
Closing with a schedule setting forth (i) the material tax attributes of each
of the Sold Entities, and (ii) any currently effective waivers of any U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign statutes of limitation with respect to, or
extensions of the period for assessment, of any material Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Sold Entities.

 



63 (b) Verizon shall determine, within ninety (90) days of the date
hereof, whether or not Verizon will be able to deliver the certification
provided for in _Section 2.6(b)(vi)_ of this Agreement, and Verizon shall
advise Vodafone as to its determination within such ninety (90) day period.
Upon Vodafones request, Verizon shall provide Vodafone with any information
relating to the Partnership and any of its Subsidiaries reasonably requested
by Vodafone to deliver the certification provided for in _Section 2.6(a)(vi)_
of this Agreement.

(c) If Vodafone determines between the date hereof and the Closing Date that
there exist items that could give rise to an indemnification obligation
pursuant to Section 9.2(c)(vi), Vodafone shall notify Verizon in writing on or
prior to the Closing Date and shall provide Verizon with reasonable detail
regarding such items. Prior to taking any action or consummating any
transaction that would reasonably be expected to trigger any Taxes with
respect to items identified by Vodafone pursuant to the preceding sentence,
Verizon shall notify Vodafone and shall consider in good faith any comments
or alternative proposals received from Vodafone within a reasonable period of
time with respect to the taking of such action or structure of such
transaction.

 

6.4 _Omnitel Entity Classification_. Vodafone shall take, or cause its
controlled Affiliates to take, all actions and to do, or cause its controlled
Affiliates to do, all things necessary, including calling board and
shareholder meetings and taking other corporate actions, to (a) (i) convert
(the " _Omnitel Conversion_ ") Omnitel under the Laws of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands from a _naamloze vennootschap_ to a _besloten vennootschap_ and
(ii) to have the Omnitel Conversion comply with the applicable Laws of the
Republic of Italy including through registration of the Omnitel Conversion
with the appropriate Governmental Entities of the Republic of Italy, in each
case effective prior to the earlier of (i) December 27, 2013, and (ii) five
(5) days preceding the Closing Date, and (b) amend, effective upon
the Omnitel Conversion, the organizational documents and shareholders
agreement of Omnitel and other agreements among the shareholders of Omnitel
relating thereto, and otherwise take all actions necessary, so as to preserve
the relative rights and obligations of such shareholders thereunder. At
Verizons written request, Vodafone shall cause Omnitel to elect, pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(a), to be classified as a partnership
for U.S. federal income tax purposes with an effective date specified in
writing by Verizon (the "Check-the-box election"). Vodafone and Verizon agree
to treat such entity classification election, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as a liquidation of Omnitel within the meaning of Sections 331 and
336 of the Code. Vodafone shall not take any action and shall not permit its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would cause Omnitel to be classified, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, as other than a partnership during the
twelve-month period following the Closing Date. Vodafone agrees to cause
Vodafone Finance 1 to elect under Section 904(f)(1)(B) of the Code and
Treasury Regulation 1.904(f)-2(c)(2) to treat up to 100% of any
foreign source income received by the consolidated U.S. federal income tax
return group of which Vodafone Finance 1 is the common parent during the year
in which the Reorganization occurs as U.S. source income so as to reduce, to
the greatest extent possible, any overall foreign loss. From and after the
date hereof, Vodafone and Verizon and their respective advisors shall
cooperate to determine the amount of the overall foreign loss, if any,
remaining in the Sold Entities after the election described in the preceding
sentence. In the event Verizon is not reasonably satisfied, acting in good
faith, that the overall foreign loss of the Sold Entities will be eliminated
or reduced to no more than a _de minimis_ amount at the end of 

 



64  the taxable year of the Sold Entities that ends on the Closing Date, Verizon
may, if Verizon requests that Vodafone cause Omnitel to make a Check-the-box
election with an effective date on or prior to December 31, 2013, deliver a
written notice to Vodafone to the effect that, in the event the Omnitel
Closing does not occur (other than by reason of a breach of Verizon), within
ten (10) days of the termination of the Omnitel Agreement (whether in
connection with a termination of this Agreement or otherwise), Verizon will
request payment of the Verizon Indemnity Amount. Verizon shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the delivery of such notice,
provide Vodafone with its calculation of the Verizon Indemnity Amount,
including supporting detail. The " _Verizon Indemnity Amount_ " shall equal
the amount of all U.S. federal, state and local income Taxes payable with
respect to the Check-the-box-election, determined on a "with and without"
basis, provided, however, that the Verizon Indemnity Amount shall not exceed
Three Hundred Million Dollars ($300,000,000).

 

6.5 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Vodafone shall terminate (or cause to be
terminated) on or before the Closing Date all Tax sharing agreements or
arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any of the Sold
Entities, on the one hand, and Vodafone or any Affiliate of Vodafone (other
than the Sold Entities), on the other hand, are parties, and neither Vodafone
nor any Affiliate of Vodafone, on the one hand, or any of the Sold Entities,
on the other hand, shall have any rights or obligations thereunder after the
Closing.

 

6.6 _No 338 Election_. Verizon shall not make an election under Section 338 of
the Code with respect to its purchase of the Sold Entities pursuant to this
Agreement.

6.7 _Purchase and Sale of the Transferred Shares_. Vodafone and Verizon agree
to treat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Shares pursuant to this Agreement as a sale or exchange
transaction subject to Section 1001 of the Code (which also constitutes a
qualified stock purchase) and not a "reorganization" under Section 368 of the
Code or an "exchange" under Section 351 of the Code. Vodafone and Verizon
shall report the purchase and sale of the Transferred Shares in accordance
with the prior sentence for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Neither
Vodafone nor Verizon shall take any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in the transfer of the Transferred Shares by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement being treated as an "exchange" under Section 351 of the Code, and
for the two-year period beginning on the Closing Date, Verizon not shall cause
Vodafone Americas Finance 1 to liquidate or to merge with any other entity
(unless Vodafone Americas Finance 1 is the surviving corporation in such
merger, provided that under no circumstances shall Verizon merge with Vodafone
Americas Finance 1 during such two-year period).

 

6.8 _Tax Refunds_. Vodafone shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes (whether
by way of payment or reduction in Taxes otherwise payable in cash) received
by Verizon or any of the Sold Entities that are attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (taking into account the allocation principles in Section
6.1(c)); provided, however, that Vodafone shall not be entitled to any
refund of Taxes (i) to the extent that such refund is attributable to either
(x) the carryback of a loss or other Tax attribute arising in a Post-Closing
Tax Period or (y) an adjustment of any item of Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit (or other items reported to its partners on
Schedule K-1 (IRS Form 1065)) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(ii) for which Vodafone is not responsible pursuant to the penultimate
sentence of Section 9.2(c). Except as provided in the foregoing sentence,
Verizon shall be entitled to any other refund of Taxes with

 



65  respect to the Sold Entities. If any party receives a refund to which
another party is entitled pursuant to this _Section 6.8_, such party shall
pay over such refund (net of costs or Taxes to the party receiving such
refund) to the party entitled to such refund no later than ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of such refund.

 

6.9 _Certain VAT Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that any payment of the Financing Failure Termination
Fee, the Verizon Reverse Termination Fee, the Verizon Recommendation Change
Fee or the Vodafone Termination Fee, being compensatory in nature, shall not
be treated, in whole or in part, as consideration for a supply for the
purposes of VAT and, accordingly, each of Verizon and Vodafone shall, and
shall procure that the representative member of any VAT group of which it is a
member will, treat the payment of any such fee as falling outside the scope of
VAT and shall pay the full amount of it free and clear of any deduction or
adjustment pursuant to Section 6.9(c)(ii) or Section 6.9(d)(iii).

(b) In the event of a Tax proceeding in which a Tax Authority asserts that:

(i) VAT was chargeable with respect to the Vodafone Termination Fee and should
have been accounted for by Vodafone under the reverse charge procedure; or

(ii) the Financing Failure Termination Fee, the Verizon Reverse Termination
Fee or the Verizon Recommendation Change Fee was, in whole or part,
consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and that VAT should have
been accounted for by Vodafone in respect of that supply;

 

 __the provisions of Section 6.2 governing Tax proceedings of the Sold
Entities for any Straddle Period shall apply, mutatis  _mutandis_ , treating
Vodafone as the Controlling Party and Verizon as the Non-Controlling Party
with respect to such Tax proceeding. __

 

(c) In the event of a final determination with respect to such Tax proceeding
to the effect that the Vodafone Termination Fee was, in whole or in part,
consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and that should have been
accounted for by Vodafone under the reverse charge procedure in respect of
that supply:

 



66 (i) Vodafone shall, and shall procure that the representative member of any
VAT group of which Vodafone is a member will, (A) account for, under the
reverse charge procedure, and pay to the relevant Tax Authority any VAT
chargeable thereon, and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to recover (by
refund, credit or otherwise) any such VAT; and

(ii) the amount of the Vodafone Termination Fee payable by Vodafone shall be
reduced by an amount such that the sum payable by Vodafone, when aggregated
with any irrecoverable VAT thereon, is equal to the amount of the Vodafone
Termination Fee that would be payable but for this Section 6.9(c)(ii).

 

(d) In the event of a final determination with respect to any such Tax
proceeding to the effect that the Financing Failure Termination Fee, the
Verizon Reverse Termination Fee or the Verizon Recommendation Change Fee was,
in whole or in part, consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and
that VAT should have been accounted for by Vodafone in respect of
that supply:

(i) Vodafone shall, and shall procure that the representative member of any
VAT group of which Vodafone is a member will, (A) account for and pay to the
relevant Tax Authority such VAT, and (B) issue a valid VAT invoice to Verizon;

 

(ii) Verizon shall, and shall procure that each of its Affiliates will, use
its reasonable best efforts to recover (by refund, credit or otherwise) any
amounts in respect of such VAT; and

(iii) the amount of the Financing Failure Termination Fee, the Verizon
Reverse Termination Fee or the Verizon Recommendation Change Fee (as the case
may be) payable by Verizon(inclusive of amounts in respect of VAT) shall be
increased by an amount such that the amount payable by Verizon less any VAT
that is actually recovered by Verizon or its Affiliates (net of costs or
Taxes to Verizon or its Affiliates) is equal to the amount of such fees that
would be payable by Verizon but for this Section 6.9(d)(iii).

 

(e) Any adjustment payment in respect of any reduction made pursuant to
Section 6.9(c)(ii) shall be made on the date which is ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which Vodafone (or the representative member of any VAT
group of which Vodafone is a member) is required to account to any Tax
Authority for any such irrecoverable VAT.

 

(f) Any payment in respect of any adjustment made pursuant to Section
6.9(d)(iii) shall be made on the date which is ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which Verizon (or any of its Affiliates) recovers (by
refund, credit or otherwise) any amounts in respect of such VAT.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt all payments of the Vodafone Termination Fee,
the Financing Failure Termination Fee, the Verizon Reverse Termination Fee
and the

 



67  Verizon Recommendation Change Fee shall be inclusive of any applicable VAT
save as otherwise provided by this Section 6.9.

 

6.10 _Post-Closing Restrictions_. Verizon and its Affiliates (including the
Sold Entities) shall not, on or after the Closing Date, (i) make or change
any Tax election or accounting method of the Sold Entities with an effective
date in any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) file or cause to be filed any amended
Tax Return for the Sold Entities (other than a state tax return reflecting
changes necessitated by an agreed Federal tax adjustment or amended U.S.
federal income tax return) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iii) extend or
waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or
other period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency with respect to any
Sold Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case without Vodafones
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

Taxing Authority.

(d) Verizon shall indemnify and hold harmless the Vodafone Indemnitees from
any and all liability for: (i) Taxes imposed on or payable by any Sold Entity
for any Post-Closing Tax Period except to the extent that Vodafone is
responsible for such Taxes pursuant to Section 9.2(c), (ii) Taxes for which
Verizon is responsible under _Section 9.2(c)_, and (iii) Taxes arising out
of or resulting from any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Verizon pursuant to _Section 5.20(a)_ or _Article VI_. 

 



80  Any indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this _Section 9.2(c)_
shall be made by wire transfer or intrabank transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Vodafone within ten (10) days after any of
the Vodafone Indemnitees makes written demand upon Verizon, but in no case
earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes or
other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

(e) Vodafone shall indemnify the Verizon Indemnitees against any Liabilities
which are incurred by the Verizon Indemnitees (such Liabilities being
determined to have the same economic effect as if they had been incurred
directly by Verizon) in relation to any Vodafone UK Pension Plan pursuant to
the exercise by the UK Pension Regulator of any of its powers under the UK
Pensions Act 2004. Vodafone shall further indemnify the Verizon Indemnitees
against any Liabilities incurred after the Closing by or in respect of any of
the Sold Entities, which Liabilities are in respect of any (i) persons who
were employed by the Sold Entities on or prior to the Closing, (ii) Employee
Benefit Plans that were sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to
be contributed to by the Sold Entities on or prior to the Closing, and (iii)
Employee Benefit Plans with respect to which the Sold Entities had any
current, future or contingent Liability on or prior to the Closing.

 

(f) The parties to this Agreement agree that any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment
to the aggregate consideration being delivered to Seller pursuant to _Section
2.2_ in the form of the Cash Consideration, the Verizon Shares, the Verizon
Notes and the Settlement Note, except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law.

9.3 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) The Person seeking indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party
against whom indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the
assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
by any third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under _Section 9.2_. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail such Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into
account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations or Liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure
shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 9.3_, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof at its sole
expense with lead counsel appointed by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if the Indemnified
Party has concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses or defense
strategies available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that there exists
or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest, such Indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at the

 



81  Indemnifying Partys reasonable expense, to separate counsel ( _provided_ ,
that such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party).

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third-
Party Claim, all the parties hereto will cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation will include the
provision of reasonable access during business hours to the Indemnifying Party
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-
Party Claim, and making employees and other Representatives and advisors
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance
with the provisions of this _Section 9.3_, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim, if (A) the settlement or
compromise does not release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
Liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim or (B) the
settlement or compromise imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Third-Party Claim
and to employ, at its expense, separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 9.3_ shall not apply with respect to Tax
Claims, which shall be governed by _Article VI_.

 

9.4 _Direct Claim Procedures_. If the Indemnified Party has a claim for
indemnity under _Section 9.2_ against the Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt
notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Vodafone shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ if the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party
would be responsible for such claim and all related claims are less than the
Applicable De Minimis Amount.

 

(b) Verizon shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section 9.2(b)_ if the Damages for which the Indemnifying Party would be
responsible for such claim and all related claims are less than the Applicable
De Minimis Amount.

 

9.6 _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(a) The amount of any Damages or Taxes payable under _Section 9.2_ by the
Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible

 



82  therefor, and shall be (i) net of any Tax benefits actually realized by the
Indemnified Party and (ii) increased by any Tax costs incurred by the
Indemnified Party (in each case, determined on a "with and without basis").
If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by
the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
in collecting such amount. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage,
or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable
under _Section 9.2_.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under _Section 9.2_ for any
punitive, exemplary or special Damages, or any other Damages that are not
reasonably foreseeable; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall prevent any
Indemnified Party from recovering for all components of awards against them
in Third-Party Claims for which recovery is provided under this _Article IX_.

 

9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing and except for the
continuing availability of specific performance pursuant to  _Section 10.6_
with respect to covenants that specify performance following the Closing Date,
_Section 9.2_ will (in the absence of fraud) provide the sole and exclusive
remedy for each of the parties hereto for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy
or breach of any representation and warranty or any breach of covenant or
other agreement occurring at or prior to the Closing or other claim arising
directly or indirectly out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby with respect to matters occurring or circumstances existing at or prior
to the Closing (other than procedures for the conduct of proceedings relating
to Tax Claims, which shall be governed by _Section 6.2_).

10.2 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of, Schedule to
or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents, glossary of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. The term "parties" shall mean Vodafone,
Seller and Verizon, and the term "party" shall be deemed to refer to either
Vodafone, Seller or Verizon, as the case may be. Whenever the
words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases
"the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" shall be deemed to refer
to September 2, 2013. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to
require Vodafone, Seller, Verizon or any of their respective Affiliates to
take any action that would violate any Law, rule or regulation.

10.3 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of (i) Vodafone and Seller, if the assigning party is Verizon
or (ii) Verizon, if the assigning party is Vodafone or Seller, and any
attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. Except to the extent that other
agreements are specifically referred to herein, this Agreement among
Vodafone, Seller and Verizon contains the entire understanding of the parties
with respect to the matters covered hereby and, except as specifically set
forth herein, none of Vodafone, Seller or Verizon makes any representation,
warranty, covenant or undertaking with respect to such matters. This Agreement
may be amended only by an agreement in writing executed by the parties hereto.
The parties hereto may amend this Agreement without notice to or the consent
of any third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Verizon
Requisite Vote or the Vodafone Requisite Share Purchase Vote, there shall not
be made any amendment that by Law requires further approval by the holders of

 



85  the Verizon Common Stock or the Vodafone Ordinary Shares without the further
approval of such shareholders.

 

10.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

10.6 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
_Section 10.6(a)_, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in the
event of a Financing Failure, Vodafone shall not be entitled to specific
performance (i) if the Transaction is to be implemented by way of the Vodafone
Scheme, to cause Verizon to appear at the Court Hearing or the hearing in
respect of the confirmation by the Court of the Vodafone Reduction of Capital,
to give any undertakings in connection with the Vodafone Scheme, or to effect
the Scheme Closing in accordance with _Section 2.3_ or (ii) if the
Transaction is to be implemented by way of the Share Purchase, to effect the
Share Purchase Closing in accordance with _Section 2.5_. Nothing in this
_Section 10.6(b)_ is intended to limit the right and entitlement of Vodafone
to specific performance in accordance with _Section 10.6(a)_ with respect to
any failure to perform or breach by Verizon of any covenant in this Agreement
other than the failure of Verizon, in the event of a Financing Failure, to
(x) appear at the Court Hearing or the hearing in respect of the confirmation
by the Court of the Vodafone Reduction of Capital, to give any undertakings in
connection with the Vodafone Scheme, or to effect the Scheme Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.3_, or (y) effect the Share Purchase Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, if the Transaction is to be implemented by way
of the Share Purchase.

 

(c) Each party further agrees that, subject to _Section 10.6(b)_, (i) such
party will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and (ii) no other party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or

 



86  post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.6_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

10.7 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, each party hereto shall do and perform or cause to be done and
performed all such further acts and things and shall execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments, and documents as any other
party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry out the intent and
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and for any
counterclaim therein.

10.9 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

(a) Each of Vodafone, Seller and Verizon irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by another party hereto
or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York (or, to the
extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court
of the State of New York in New York County), and each of Vodafone, Seller and
Verizon hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each
of Vodafone, Seller and Verizon hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 10.9_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto expressly agrees (i) that it will not bring or support any lawsuit,
claim, complaint, action, formal investigation or proceeding before any
Governmental Entity (each, an " _Action_ "), whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Related
Party arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby in
any forum other than any state or federal court sitting in the borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof, (ii) to waive
and hereby waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such Action and
(iii) that any such Action shall

 



87  be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
New York, without regard to the conflicts of Law rules of such state that
would result in the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in (i) _Article IX_
and  _Sections 5.15_, _8.2_ and _8.3(f)_ and, with respect to the Financing
Related Parties (in their capacities as such), _Sections 8.3(g)_ , _8.3(h)_
and _10.9(b)_ , this Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns and is not for
the benefit of, nor may any provision of this Agreement be enforced by, any
other person. For the avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to provide any Vodafone Shareholder (or any party acting on its
behalf) the ability to assert or enforce any right (whether in its capacity as
a Vodafone Shareholder or derivatively or otherwise on behalf of Vodafone) or
seek any remedies pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Financing Related Parties are express third party beneficiaries of _Sections
8.3(g)_ , _8.3(h)_ and _10.9(b)_.

 

10.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the
conflicts of Law rules of such state that would result in the application of
the Laws of any other jurisdiction.

10.12  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

 

10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but
all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
Each of the parties hereto (i) has agreed to permit the use, from time to
time, of faxed or otherwise electronically transmitted signatures in order to
expedite the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
intends to be bound by its respective faxed or otherwise electronically
transmitted signature, (iii) is aware that the other parties hereto will rely
on the faxed or otherwise electronically transmitted signature, and (iv)
acknowledges such reliance and waives any defenses to the enforcement of the
documents effecting the transaction contemplated by this Agreement based on
the fact that a signature was sent by fax or otherwise electronically
transmitted.

10.14 _Extension; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Closing, Verizon
and Vodafone by action taken or authorized by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend
the time for or waive the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained here; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after receipt of
the Verizon Requisite Vote or the Vodafone Requisite Share Purchase Vote,
there shall not be made any waiver that by Law requires further approval by
the holders of the Verizon Common Stock or the Vodafone Ordinary Shares
without the further approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part
of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party.
