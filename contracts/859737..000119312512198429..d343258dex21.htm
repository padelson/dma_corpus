forth in _Article VIII_ (excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be
satisfied until the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless this
Agreement shall have been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of

Letter (or if Financing Agreements have been entered into, pursuant to such
Financing Agreements) on the date that would otherwise be the Closing Date,

Agreements have been entered into, pursuant to such Financing Agreements)
(subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article

promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing Date, the Company will
cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will
become effective on such date and at such time as the Certificate of Merger

at such later date or time as may be agreed by Parent and the Company in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE III 

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_

 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to this
Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of the Shares:

(a) Each Share then owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary
of the Company (or held in the Companys treasury) or owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any direct or indirect Subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment or
distribution shall be made or delivered with respect thereto.

 



12 (b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and Dissenting
Shares, automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the Price Per Share, without interest
thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing such Share (a "
_Certificate_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in the manner
provided in _Section 3.2_. Such Shares, other than those canceled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_, sometimes are referred to herein as the " _Merger
Shares_."

(d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding Shares is changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger
Consideration payable per Merger Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

Section 3.2 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) designate a bank or trust
company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_
") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Paying Agent, to serve as
the Paying Agent for the Merger Consideration. Prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
Parent will deposit with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Option Payment in
respect of all Company Options (other than 2012 Options)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Restricted Stock
Payment in respect of each share of Company Restricted Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Performance Share Payment in
respect of each Company Performance Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Pending distribution of the cash deposited with the Paying
Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Merger Shares, Company Options (other than 2012 Options), shares of Company
Restricted Stock and Company Performance Shares, in each case, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not be used for any other
purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may direct the Paying Agent to
invest such cash in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts,
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of, or demand deposits with, commercial banks

 



13 having a combined capital and surplus of at least $1,000,000,000 (based on the
most recent financial statements of such bank which are publicly available),
or (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Standard and
Poors Corporation or Moodys Investor Services, Inc.; _provided further_ , 
_however_ , that no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent
from making the payments required by this _Article III_. Any interest and
other income produced by such investments shall be for the account of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later
than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record
holder of Merger Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration a letter
of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the
Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in
customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss, and if requested by Parent appropriate indemnity, in lieu
thereof) will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss, and if
requested by Parent appropriate indemnity, in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent. Upon surrender of Certificate or Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss, and if requested by Parent appropriate indemnity, in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter
of transmittal and any other documentation that the Paying Agent may
reasonably require, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor. Upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall, without being required to deliver a
Certificate or a completed and executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the aggregate number of Book-Entry
Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ by (B) the Merger Consideration, less any
applicable withholding Taxes, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be
canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof together with any required indemnity) and transferred
Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as
the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of such Certificates or upon
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 3.2(b)_. Until
surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(b)_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or Book-Entry Share or Book-Entry
Shares so transferred shall be properly transferred and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any applicable stock
transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not payable.

 



14 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock
transfer books or ledgers of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article III_.

 

(e) If any cash deposited with the Paying Agent remains unclaimed six (6)
months after the Effective Time, such cash and any interest accrued thereon
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who
has not surrendered such holders Certificates for the Merger Consideration
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of a
date immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

(g) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

 

(h) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in addition to the posting by
such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the proper amount of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof
entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.

(i) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of local, state, federal, or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent any amounts are so deducted or withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
timely

 



15  paid to the applicable Tax authority and shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards
and Performance Awards_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option, other than 2012 Options,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any holder of any Company Option and converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto, payable by the Surviving
Corporation, equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such
Company Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Payment_
"). As of the Effective Time, all Company Options, other than 2012 Options,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Option (other than 2012 Options) shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Payment.

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each 2012 Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Parent and shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions, including vesting, applicable to each such 2012 Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Each assumed 2012 Option shall be exercisable
(or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock) of (i) the number of Shares that
would have been issuable upon exercise of such 2012 Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio. The per share
exercise price of each such 2012 Option shall equal the quotient (which shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the
exercise price per Share applicable to such 2012 Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to each Person
who holds a 2012 Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
2012 Option by Parent. It is the intention of the parties that the assumption
of the 2012 Options shall be effected in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



16 (iii) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption
of the 2012 Options pursuant to this _Section 3.3(a)_, including the
reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_. Parent
shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of
Parent Stock subject to the 2012 Options and, where applicable, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. With respect to those
individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject
to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where
applicable, Parent shall administer any equity compensation plan of the
Company assumed pursuant to this _Section 3.3(a)_ in a manner that complies
with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(b) _Treatment of Company Performance Shares_. The performance periods
applicable to each Company Performance Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and 150% of the target number of Company Performance Shares subject to
each such Company Performance Share award with respect to such performance
period shall fully vest as of the Effective Time and shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect
thereto, payable by the Surviving Corporation, equal to the product of (i) the
number of vested Company Performance Shares subject to such award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after taking into account the
accelerated vesting provided for herein) and (ii) the Merger Consideration,
less any applicable withholding Taxes (the " _Performance Share Payment_ "),
subject, however, to any rights of such holder pursuant to _Section 3.4_. As
of the Effective Time, all Company Performance Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each
holder of Company Performance Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Performance Share Payment.

(c) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock_. With respect to each share of
Company Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the vesting restrictions shall lapse as of the Effective Time, and each share
of Company Restricted Stock shall be converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto, payable by the Surviving
Corporation, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding Taxes (the "
_Restricted Stock Payment_ "), subject, however, to any rights of such holder
pursuant to _Section 3.4_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Restricted Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of shares of Company
Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Restricted Stock Payment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this _Section 3.3(c)_, any cash payment relating to
Company Restricted Stock granted pursuant to a deferred issuance restricted
stock award shall not be paid at the time set forth above, and shall be paid
at the time that Shares would otherwise have been delivered pursuant to the
terms of such deferred issuance restricted stock award as in effect on the
date hereof.

 



17 (d) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions such that (i)
the then current offering period under the ESPP ends on the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time (the " _Final Purchase Date_ "), (ii) no
new purchase or offering period under the ESPP commences on or following the
Final Purchase Date and (iii) as of the Effective Time the ESPP terminates in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP. On the Final Purchase Date, the Company
shall apply all funds credited as of such date under such ESPP within each
participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Shares in
accordance with the terms of such ESPP. On or after the date of this
Agreement, in no event (x) shall any person who is not currently
participating in the ESPP be permitted to begin participating in the ESPP, and
(y) shall any new offering period commence after the date hereof and prior to
the Final Purchase Date.

 

(e) _Treatment of Bonus Plans_.

(i) Each participant who has been granted an annual cash bonus award in
respect of the 2012 calendar year under the Executive Bonus Plan shall be
entitled to a cash payment, payable by the Surviving Corporation as required
by Section 3.5 of the Executive Bonus Plan, which cash payment shall be equal
to the greater of 100% of each such participants target bonus amount or
actual year-to-date performance (in each case pro-rated to the Closing Date
and without the exercise of negative discretion under Section 3.3 of the
Executive Bonus Plan).

(ii) Each participant who has been granted an annual cash bonus award in
respect of the 2012 calendar year under the Employee Bonus Plan shall be
entitled, at the time of the regular payment of bonuses in accordance with
Section III.A of the Employee Bonus Plan, to a cash payment, payable by the
Surviving Corporation in an amount calculated solely pursuant to Section III.C
of the Employee Bonus Plan and determined in good faith by the
Surviving Corporation.

(iii) Each eligible participant who has been granted an annual cash bonus
award in respect of the 2012 calendar year under the Employee Bonus Plan and
whose employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Date and prior to the regular payment of bonuses for 2012 under the
Employee Bonus Plan shall be entitled to a cash payment, payable by the
Surviving Corporation in an amount calculated by multiplying such employees
base salary by (x) such employees Target % as set forth on Exhibit A or
Exhibit B of the Employee Bonus Plan, as applicable, and (y) the Company
Performance Factor for 2012 and further multiplying such result by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of full months such employee was employed
by the Company during the period from January 1, 2012 through December 31,
2012 and the denominator of which is twelve (12); _provided_ , _howeve_ r,
that no such terminated employee shall be eligible to receive a bonus if (A)
such employee is terminated for "Cause" (as defined in the Companys form of
employee stock option agreement under the 2003 Plan) or (B) such employee is
terminated based upon a good faith determination by the Surviving Corporation
at the time of termination that such employees performance has not been at
an acceptable level.

 



18 (f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all such actions as may be required to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger and who is entitled to demand and properly demands, exercises, and
perfects his or her demand for appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to appraisal under the
DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL and shall be entitled to receive consideration thereunder. At the
Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
canceled and cease to exist. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with

right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.

(a) The Company has filed or furnished (as applicable) all forms, documents,
proxy statements and reports with the SEC required to be filed prior to the
date hereof by the Company since January 1, 2009 under the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act (as such reports and statements may have been amended since
the date of their filing and prior to the date hereof, the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "). As of their respective filing dates or, if amended or restated
prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment
or applicable subsequent filing, the Company SEC Reports (i) complied in all
material respects with, to the extent in effect at the time of filing, the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Except as set forth on  _Section
4.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, (i) there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC
staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports, and (ii) to
the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject

thereon by Ernst and Young LLP, the independent auditors of the Company, and
the unaudited financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Reports on Form 10-Q (the " _Financial Statements_ ") fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein including the notes thereto) in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in
the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

 

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs
(e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The Companys management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2011
and the description of such assessment set forth in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 is accurate
in all material respects.

(c) The Company has disclosed to its auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls
prior to the date hereof (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls.

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company. The Company is
in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the provisions of the Exchange Act and the Securities
Act relating thereto which under the terms of such provisions have become
applicable to the Company.

 

(e) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act with respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in
such certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



24 (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is subject to
any " _Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement_ " (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act).

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in the Company SEC Reports, (b) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2012, (c) for
liabilities arising under the terms of any Company Material Contract other
than liabilities or obligations due to breaches thereunder, or (d) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company, other than
those which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar contract (including any contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) where the purpose or intended effect of such arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated financial statements. 

Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Except for matters in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, or as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed or furnished prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 2011
through the date of this Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice in all material respects.

 

(b) From December 31, 2011 to the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise

employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company_ _Benefit
Plans_ "). The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy
of each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to United States Law and all
amendments thereto and a true and complete copy of the following items (in
each case, only if applicable): (i) each trust or other funding arrangement,

(iii) the most recently filed annual report on IRS Form 5500 and (iv) the
most recently received IRS determination letter.

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, no event has occurred and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances, in connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or ERISA Affiliates could be subject to any liability that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

(c) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, no
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full. None of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries participates in any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA, or any pension or retirement plan sponsored by any
union or similar employee representative or sponsored by more than one
unrelated employer.

(d) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there
is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, or by any Company Benefit Plan, other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course. 

(e) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or as
otherwise provided herein, neither the execution or delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger will, either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, (i) entitle any current or former director,
employee, consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee,
consultant or independent contractor or (iii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting of compensation due any such director, employee, consultant or
independent contractor.

(f) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, all
contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) required to have been timely made under any of the
Company Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established thereunder or in
connection therewith have been made by the due date

 



26  thereof. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan, except as would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, no Company Benefit Plan is, or within the preceding

benefit obligation for contributions which has not been made or properly
accrued and there are not material benefit obligations which have not been

GAAP, on the financial statements of the Company, other than those which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

(i) Any Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination, opinion or
advisory letter from the IRS to the effect that that such Company Benefit Plan
is qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. Alternatively, any
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code but has not received such a letter from the IRS, has either timely
applied for such a letter or there remains time to timely apply for, and make
any plan amendments required in order to receive, such a letter in accordance
with applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or IRS
pronouncements.

(j) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Company Benefit Plan
(other than any Company Equity Plan, or an employment, severance, change in
control, or other similar agreement with an individual) is amendable and
terminable unilaterally by the Company, and any Company Subsidiaries party
thereto or covered thereby at any time, without material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof, other than for
benefits accrued as of the date of termination or amendment, routine
administrative costs and any required minimum notice periods under such
Company Benefit Plan.

(k) Except as required by Section 601, et seq. of ERISA, no Company Benefit

Subsidiaries of any collective bargaining or other labor union contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound. There are no collective
bargaining or other labor union contracts to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound. As of the

 



27  date of this Agreement, none of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are represented by any union with respect to their employment by
the Company or such Subsidiary. Since January 1, 2009, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any material labor disputes, union
organization attempts or work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts due to labor
unrest.

 

(m) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger,
nor any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) result in
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code
to any disqualified individual within the meaning of Section 280G(c).

(n) Except as set forth in _Section 4.8(n)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since March 1, 2012, the Company has not made any material change
in the compensation, benefits or bonus payable or to become payable to, or
granted any severance, termination or change of control payment (or right to
receive any such payment) to, or agreed to accelerate, as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the vesting of any Company

use reasonable best efforts in accordance with and subject to Delaware Law,
the Company Charter Documents and the NASDAQ Listing Rules to cause a meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") to be duly called and

applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, to cause any
information supplied by or on such partys behalf, as applicable, not to

materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby. 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties in

on freedom of actions with respect to, or its ability, in any material
respect, to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses, operations,

or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or

during Parents fiscal year ended September 24, 2011; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall authorize the Company to
commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to obtain any consents, approvals,
permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby relating to any Regulatory Law or to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding relating to

shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate in all respects
with each other and to contest and resist any such Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or

applicable Law (including any Regulatory Laws), (ii) which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is required to keep confidential by reason of
contract or agreement with third parties, or (iii) which it reasonably

appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, and

Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Non-Solicitation and Recommendation Withdrawal_.

negotiations with, furnish non-public information relating to the Company to,
or otherwise cooperate with, any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and
other representatives (any such other Person, a " _Third Party_ ") with
respect to the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair

Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet,

understanding, or acquisition or merger agreement or other similar definitive
agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal; (iv) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent (it being understood that taking

or make any statement materially inconsistent with, the Recommendation (a "
_Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); or (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of
the foregoing related to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company may waive the terms of a
standstill agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement if and only if
the terms of such standstill agreement require the Company to invite the
counterparty to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal, and if the other party
to such standstill agreement expressly requests such a waiver then the Company
shall grant such a waiver solely to the extent necessary to enable such other
party to submit a bona fide written, unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal

submission by such other party of a bona fide written unsolicited Company
Acquisition Proposal as if such standstill agreement were not in effect.

Company Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this _Section 7.5_ or any standstill or similar agreement, from a Third
Party and (ii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined), then the Company may,
subject to compliance with _Section 7.5(c)_, (A) furnish non-public
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Third Party making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Company
Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, disclose any non-public information to such Third Party without
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as hereinafter
defined), and (y) will as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after it is provided to such Third Party provide to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to such Third Party which was not previously provided to Parent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company will not take any of the actions
described in (A) or (B) above unless and until the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, that the failure to take that action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law.

 



57 (c) The Board of Directors shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding subsection unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action at least one (1) Business Day prior to taking such action.
In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than 36 hours) after receipt by any Representative of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, or of any request for non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide
such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making,
and the terms and conditions of, any Company Acquisition Proposal, indication
or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current
basis, of the status and details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request and promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence or communications
sent or provided to or by the Company and its Representatives in connection
with any Company Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, directly
or indirectly, (i) effect a Recommendation Withdrawal (subject to the next
following sentence in this _Section 7.5(d)_) or (ii) approve any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, agreement in principle or
similar definitive agreement, arrangement or understanding, or acquisition or
merger agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to, or that
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder
Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Stockholder Approval), the Board
of Directors may, (A) in response to a Superior Proposal, effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal, provided that the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law or (B) in response to
an Intervening Event, effect a Recommendation Withdrawal provided that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law, and _provided_ , _further_ , that in either case the Board of
Directors shall not effect a Recommendation Withdrawal, unless the Company (w)
notifies Parent, in writing, at least four (4) Business Days before taking
that action advising Parent that the Board of Directors intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail (including, if
applicable, a copy of any draft definitive agreement with respect to any
Superior Proposal), (x) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this
Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Recommendation
Withdrawal, and (y) if the contemplated Recommendation Withdrawal is in
response to a Superior Proposal, during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Financing Commitments so that such Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal. The parties agree that if there is any
proposed amendment to the financial terms of a Superior Proposal or any other
material terms thereof, such proposed amendment shall require a new written
notification from the Company to Parent and an additional four (4) Business
Day period that satisfies this _Section 7.5(d)_.

 



58 (e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any existing
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to
the date hereof with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and shall
request that any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession
of confidential information about the Company or its Subsidiaries that was
previously furnished to such Third Party by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all such information.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of
Directors, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Company Stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company Stockholders) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to Company Stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as
expressly permitted by _Section 7.5(d)_ effect a Recommendation Withdrawal
or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend a
Company Acquisition Proposal.

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 7.5_ by any Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 7.5_ by the
Company.

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, the term:

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality, "standstill" and non-solicitation
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such agreement
shall not prohibit the Company from providing to Parent any of the information
required to be provided to Parent under this  _Section 7.5_;

(ii) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest
or offer from any Person or group of persons other than Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates relating to (A) any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of assets that constitute fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) any direct or indirect acquisition of
fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class or series of Company Securities,
(C) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
any Person or group of Persons beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or
more of any class or series of capital stock of the Company, or (D) any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation,

 



59 dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary of
the Company whose business constitutes fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole); and

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material development or change in
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither
known to the Board of Directors nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior to
the date hereof, provided, that (i) in no event shall any action taken by
either party pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set
forth in _Section 7.2_ of this Agreement and the consequence of any such
action, constitute an Intervening Event, (ii) in no event shall the receipt,
existence of or terms of an Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event,
and (iii) in no event shall such Intervening Event result from a change in the
market price of the Common Stock of the Company.

 

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, bona fide, unsolicited Company
Acquisition Proposal (for this purpose, substituting "a majority" for each
reference to "fifteen percent (15%) or more" in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal) that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.5_
or any standstill or similar agreement that the Board of Directors in good
faith determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Company Stockholders (solely in their capacity as such)
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby (x)
after taking into account such factors as the Board of Directors considers to
be appropriate (including the likelihood of consummation of such transaction
on the terms set forth therein and the legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal, including any conditions relating to financing, regulatory
approvals or other events or circumstances), and (y) after taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise.

Section 7.6 _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing), in the
same manner as provided by the Company immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, each present and former director, officer and employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities), including any
person who becomes a director, officer or employee prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines,
penalties, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection with any
claim, suit, action, Proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative), whenever asserted or claimed, based on,
arising out of or pertaining to, in whole or in part

 



60  (A) the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) acts or omissions by
an Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection
with serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of any other
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other business (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at or prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to any
claim, suit, action, Proceeding or investigation or any acts or omissions
relating, in whole or in part, to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), in all such cases to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Indemnified Parties in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in (A) the Company Charter Documents and the
Companys Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, and (B) any indemnification agreement or other
applicable contract of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, which
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification
policy with an insurer with the same or better credit rating as the current
carrier for the Company that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such
person covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policy of
the Company on terms with respect to coverage, retentions and limits of
liability and in amounts no less favorable than those of the Companys
directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if any annual premium for such insurance coverage exceeds three hundred
percent (300%) of such annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. The Surviving Corporations obligations under this _Section 7.6(b)_
may be satisfied by Parent or, with the approval of Parent (such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld), the Company, purchasing a "tail" policy from an
insurer with substantially the same or better credit rating as the current
carrier for the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy,
which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii)
covers each person covered by the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement or at the Effective
Time for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, and
(iii) contains terms with respect to coverage, retentions and limits of
liability and in amounts that are no less favorable than those of the
Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement. If such "tail" policy has been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such policy in full force and effect,
for its full term, and shall honor all obligations thereunder.

 



61 (c) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain in effect for six (6) years after the Effective Time in the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation and
bylaws provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any claim, suit, action, Proceeding
or investigation pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such claim, suit, action, Proceeding
or investigation or resolution thereof. In addition, for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay any expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements) of any Indemnified Party under
this  _Section 7.6_ (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations referred to in this _Section 7.6_) as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent required by applicable Law.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
successors, heirs or Representatives, and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have under the Company Charter Documents, the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any applicable Law, by contract or otherwise.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this  _Section 7.6_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger indefinitely and shall be binding on the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall succeed to and honor the indemnification obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.6_.

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Recommendation
Withdrawal in accordance with _Section 7.5(d)_ or any action taken pursuant
to, and in accordance with, _Section 7.5_ or _Article IX_ , so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the parties will consult with each other, and use
reasonable best efforts to accommodate the comments (including as to timing)
of the other, before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. No party

 



62  hereto or any of its respective Affiliates or representatives will issue any
such press release or make any such other public statement or schedule any
such press conference or conference call prior to such consultation, except
to the extent the disclosing party determines it is required to do so by
applicable Law or any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national stock exchange, in which case that party will use its reasonable
best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release
or making any such public statement.

 

Section 7.8 _Notice of Current Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would reasonably be expected to cause any of
their respective representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) the receipt of
any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent or the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) any failure of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to materially comply
with or materially satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 7.8_ shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice, and (y) the failure to comply with this _Section 7.8_
shall not constitute the failure of any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be satisfied unless the underlying event would independently
result in the failure of such a condition to be so satisfied.

 

Section 7.9 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide all individuals who are employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Effective Time so long as they remain employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including employees who are not actively at work
on account of illness, disability or leave of absence) on the Effective Time
(taken as a whole, the " _Affected Employees_ "), with (i) annual base salary
or hourly wage rates no less than the annual base salary or hourly wage rates
as in effect for such Affected Employee as of the Effective Time and (ii)
other compensation and employee benefits (whether pursuant to compensation or
benefit plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Subsidiary of Parent) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
other compensation and employee benefits that are provided generally
to similarly situated employees of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
for purposes of determining "other compensation and employee benefits"
required to be provided pursuant to clause (ii) above,
incentive compensation, change in control bonuses, supplemental executive
retirement benefits and any benefits that may result in excise taxes being
imposed on the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be excluded. Nothing
contained in this  _Section 7.9_ shall be deemed to grant any Affected
Employee any right to continued employment after the

 



63  Effective Time nor to preclude Parent or its Subsidiaries from terminating
the employment of any Affected Employee for any reason or for no reason at any
time following the Effective Time. Additionally, nothing contained in this
_Section 7.9_ shall be deemed to grant any Affected Employee any right to any
specific type or amount of, or eligibility for, any compensation or benefit
under any specific incentive compensation plan or employee benefit plan.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall to the
extent permitted by applicable Law or plan terms use reasonable best efforts
to provide any Affected Employees with credit for employment with the Company
for purposes of determining eligibility and vesting under any Parent employee
compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Affected
Employees as of and after the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries for the Affected Employees service with the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Surviving
Corporation Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time under any similar Company Benefit Plan. With
respect to each Surviving Corporation Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, for the applicable plan year in
which the Closing occurs, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, Affected Employees under similar plans maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) For a period of at least two (2) years following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, pay to any Affected Employee whose
service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) is terminated during such two (2) year period severance
benefits that are not less favorable than the greater of (i) those severance
benefits provided to such Affected Employees under the terms of any individual
employment agreement to which such individual is a party in accordance with
the terms thereof as of the date hereof or any Company severance plan,
program, policy or guideline in which such individual is eligible to
participate as of the date hereof, and (ii) those severance benefits provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to (i) confer upon or give to any person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employees or Affected
Employees), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 7.9_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement, or (ii) constitute an amendment or
modification of any Company Benefit Plan.

Section 7.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Parent and the Company shall promptly
advise each other orally and in writing of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, arbitration, mediation, or investigation commenced or, to the
Knowledge of the Company on the one hand and to the knowledge of Parent on
the other hand, threatened prior to the Effective Time against

 



64  Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective
directors, relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall keep each other
reasonably informed regarding any such occurrence. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, negotiation, or
settlement of any litigation against the Company and/or its directors and/or
executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall give the
Company the opportunity to participate in the defense, negotiation, or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against Parent and/or its directors
and/or executive officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without limiting in any way the parties obligations under this _Section
7.10_, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate, shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective directors, officers, employees and
Representatives to cooperate, in the defense of such stockholder litigation.

 

Section 7.11 _Obligations of Parent and the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of
the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action (and, after the Effective Time, an undertaking on the part of the
Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action).

Section 7.12 _Parent Representative_ s. Parent hereby designates the
two officers of Parent set forth on _Section 7.12_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, or such other officers as Parent may designate upon written notice
to the Company (the " _Parent Representatives_ "), to be responsible
for determining whether consent to any action prohibited by _Section 6.1_
shall be given by Parent. The Parent Representatives shall respond promptly in
writing to any request for consent to the taking of any action under 
_Section 6.1_. The Company may rely on any consent or response given by any
of the Parent Representatives.

Section 7.13 _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment for the commitment period set forth therein, (ii) comply with
its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter; (iii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive financing agreements with respect to the Debt Financing as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (any such agreements the "
_Financing Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Fee Letter, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment

 



65  Letter and the Financing Agreements that are within the control of Parent or
Merger Sub and upon satisfaction of such conditions, consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing; provided that under no circumstances
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to sell, dispose or
otherwise transfer any assets in order to satisfy any conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letter or in order to arrange or obtain the Debt Financing. Parent
shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter
and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of
the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources
(including to reduce the amount of the Debt Financing), provided that any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements that
amends the Debt Financing and/or substitutes all or any portion of the Debt
Financing (A) shall not expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the original
Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements, (B) shall provide for a
financing amount (which when added to Parents available, unrestricted cash on
hand, cash equivalents and marketable securities) will not be less than the
amount necessary to satisfy the Required Amounts in full, and (C) shall not
prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger beyond the Outside Date. If
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes aware
of any event or circumstance that is reasonably likely to result in any
portion of the Debt Financing becoming unavailable, in each case, on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and such portion is
reasonably required to satisfy the Required Amounts in full, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to seek to arrange and obtain alternative debt
financing from the same and/or alternative financing institutions in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, upon terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent or Merger Sub than those in the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Financing Agreement, a copy of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company. Any reference in this Agreement to (i) " _Debt Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended,
modified, replaced, or supplemented in compliance with this _Section 7.13_
and (ii) " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents as amended,
modified, replaced or supplemented in compliance with this _Section 7.13_.
Parent shall give the Company notice promptly after Parent becomes aware of
(x) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreement, (y) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written
notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with respect
to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement of any provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreement and (z) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall provide to
the Company copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing (including,
without limitation, the Financing Agreements and excluding any ancillary
documents subject to confidentiality agreements, including fee letters and
engagement letters). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a prompt basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing (or any replacement financing). For the avoidance of doubt,
the syndication of the Debt Financing to the extent permitted by the Debt
Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to violate Parent or Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement.

 



66 (b) The Company shall provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and
their respective Representatives (including its legal, tax, regulatory and
accounting advisors), to provide, at Parents sole expense, such cooperation
in connection with the Debt Financing as Parent shall reasonably request,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) provide, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to Parent and its Financing Sources information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including information to be
used in the preparation of a customary information package regarding the
business, operations, financial condition, projections and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries customary for financings similar to the Debt
Financing) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Financing
Sources to assist in preparation of customary offering or information
documents to be used for the completion of the Debt Financing as contemplated

obligor), and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) without
limiting the generality of clause (iii) above, furnish Parent and Merger Sub,

the Company, as of the Effective Time, for the purpose of taking corporate
action related to the Debt Financing as of the Effective Time). In the event
that the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements are amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, including as a result of
obtaining alternative financing in accordance with  _Section 7.13(a)_, or if

Parent to deliver such notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on behalf
of the Company upon Closing (a " _FIRPTA Certificate_ "); provided that, if

_TERMINATION_

Section 9.1 _Termination Prior to Effective Time_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time (whether or not Stockholder Approval has been obtained, except as
otherwise specifically indicated below) by action taken or authorized by the
board of directors of the terminating party:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand;

(b) by either the Company, on the one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if:

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party if there has
been any material breach by such party of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which was the principal cause of the
failure of any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_
hereto to be satisfied on or before the Outside Date; and _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that if, as of the Outside Date, all conditions to this Agreement
shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied), other than the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.1(c)_ due to the failure to receive any required consent
or clearance under any applicable Regulatory Law from a Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction or any action by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction to prevent the Merger for 

 



71  antitrust reasons, then Parent or the Company may extend the Outside Date to
the nine (9) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, in which case
the Outside Date shall be deemed for all purposes such date, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however,_ that if as of October 1, 2012, either of the conditions
to closing set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_ shall not have
been satisfied and this Agreement has not, as of such date, been terminated,
and thereafter both of such conditions are satisfied on or prior to October
29, 2012, then Parent or the Company may extend the Outside Date to the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the date upon which the last of the
conditions to closing set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_ was
satisfied in order to complete the financing required to consummate the
transaction, but in no event later than November 30, 2012, in which case the
Outside Date shall be deemed for all purposes such date.

(ii) there shall be any final and nonappealable Law or any Governmental
Authority issues any order or takes any other action that makes consummation
of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_
shall not be available to any party if there has been any material breach by
such party of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which was the principal cause of the issuance of such order or
taking of such other action;

(iii) at the Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof) the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained upon a vote
taken with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the

(i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement (other than the
failure of Parent to consummate the Merger as a result of a Financing
Failure) shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.3(a)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date or is not cured by the earlier of (A) ten
(10) Business Days following written notice to Parent by the Company of such
breach and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is
not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, not to be satisfied;

 

(ii) the Board of Directors has determined to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal to the
extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, _Section
7.5(d)_, and, concurrently with such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of a Superior Proposal
and pays the Termination Fee to Parent required by _Section 9.3(e)_;

 



72 (d) by Parent if:

 

(i) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than a breach of
_Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.5_ which shall be the subject of _Section_
_9.1(d)(ii)_ below) shall have occurred which would cause any of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 8.2(a)_ not to be satisfied, and such
breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date or is not cured by the
earlier of (A) ten (10) Business Days following written notice to the Company
by Parent of such breach and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or
_Section 8.3_, not to be satisfied;

(ii) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
Representatives shall have breached in any material respect their respective
obligations under _Section 7.1(c)_ or _Section 7.5_; or

Material Breach of this Agreement by another party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after Stockholder
Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made which under applicable
Law or the rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the
Company Stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment may be made to _Section 10.4_,
_Section 10.8_, _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.12(c)_ that adversely
affects the rights of any Financing Source without the prior written consent
of such Financing Source.

Section 10.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the requirements of applicable Law, any party hereto may (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (iii) subject to the proviso in _Section 10.4_, waive compliance with any
of the agreements or

 



77  conditions contained for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

Section 10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to the conflicts of law principles thereof.

Section 10.8 _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile or pdf signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of
the other parties hereto (by facsimile, pdf or otherwise). No provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except (i) as provided in
_Section 7.6_, (ii) for the right of the Company Stockholders and holders of
Company Options (other than 2012 Options), Company Restricted Stock and
Company Performance Shares to receive the Merger Consideration, Option
Payment, Restricted Stock Payment or Performance Share Payment as provided in
_Article III_ as a result of the Merger and (iii) with respect to the
Financing Sources, as provided in _Section 10.12(c)_. _Section 10.4_,
_Section 10.8_,  _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.12(c)_ shall inure to the
benefit of the Financing Sources, who are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof.

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any applicable
Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



78 Section 10.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits, annexes
and appendices hereto, together with the other instruments referred to herein)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and supersede all oral or
written prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings among the
parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to (in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including
monetary damages, except as limited by _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_) (a)
a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent or the Company
is obligated to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated
(other than as a result of the other partys refusal to close in violation of
this Agreement) each of the Company and Parent expressly acknowledges and
agrees that the other party shall have suffered irreparable harm, that
monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party, and that
such other party shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parents or the
Companys, as the case may be, obligation to consummate the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be entitled to
enforce specifically the obligations of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived and the
proceeds of the Debt Financing are then available in full pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter (or if Financing Agreements have been entered into,
pursuant to such Financing Agreements). Each party further agrees that no
other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and any of its Affiliates (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources arising out of, or
relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Commitment, the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder or related thereto shall be to receive payment of the Financing
Failure Fee from Parent in accordance with the terms of _Section 9.3(i)_ and
none of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company or its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Commitment or the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise. In no event shall the Company be entitled
to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against the
Financing Sources.

 



79 Section 10.12 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction over the matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or
proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such court, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
10.1_. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.12_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Proceeding, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment, the
Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate
court thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court,
(ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone
else in bringing any such Proceeding in any other court, (iii) that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them
at their respective addresses provided in

 



80   _Section 10.1_, or in any other manner permitted by applicable Law, shall
be effective service of process against them for any such Proceeding brought
in any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court, (v) to waive and
hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such Proceeding,
(vi) that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law, (vii) that any such Proceeding shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in
the application of the laws of any other State and (viii) that the Financing
Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any
provisions in this _Section 10.12_.

 

Section 10.13 _Authorship_. The parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

Section 10.14 _Schedules_. Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or
information in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosure of such fact,
circumstance or information with respect to any other Sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule, respectively, if it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates to one or more or all of such
Sections. The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule or
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence
of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of
materiality for any purpose whatsoever.
