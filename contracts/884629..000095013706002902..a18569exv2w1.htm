 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS_  

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) _Conversion Generally_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") validly issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.1(e) or as to which appraisal rights are perfected pursuant to Section 2.1(f)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.00 per share, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Parent-Owned Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (d) _Change in Shares_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, split, combination, contribution or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Options and Company RSUs, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

If after the Effective Time such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses such stockholders right to appraisal, such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than a Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one-year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, without any interest thereon.

 (b) Section 3.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all of the real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Owned Real Property_ ").

All material Taxes due and owing by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Return) have been paid. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. During 

   #####

Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

There are no matters currently under discussion with any Tax authority or other Governmental Entity with respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional material liability for Taxes with respect to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries. During the past five years, no issues relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries were raised by the relevant Tax authority or other Governmental Entity in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period that ends after the Closing Date.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any predecessor has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such extension or waiver. 

  

 (d) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to statutory Liens for current Taxes or other governmental charges not yet due and payable or the amount or validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and are adequately reserved as shown on the Current Balance Sheet). 

  

 (e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely withheld, collected, deposited or paid all material Taxes required to have been withheld, collected, deposited or paid, as the case may be, in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.

 (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has consented at any time under former Section 341(f)(1) of the Code to have the provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition of the assets of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) has agreed, or is required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise; (iii) has made an election, or is required, to treat any of its assets as owned by another Person pursuant to the provisions of former Section 168(f) of the Code or as tax-exempt bond financed property or tax-exempt use property within the meaning of Section 168 of the Code; (iv) has acquired or owns any assets that directly or indirectly secure any debt the interest on which is tax exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code; (v) has made or will make a consent dividend election under Section 565 of the Code; (vi) except as set forth on Section 3.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, has elected at any time to be treated as an S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 or 1362 of the Code; or (vii) made any of the foregoing elections or is required to apply any of the foregoing rules under any comparable state or local Tax provision.

If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction such that, if the treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed, the transaction would constitute a substantial understatement of federal income tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code, then the Company or such Subsidiary, as the 

   ##### 

  

    

case may be, believes that it has either (x) substantial authority for the tax

facts affecting the tax treatment of such transaction.

receipt of the Company Requisite Vote: 

  

 (w) the Companys Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 

  

 (x) the Companys Board of Directors has notified Parent in writing of the determination described in clause (w) above; and 

  

 (y) in the case of any such actions taken in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, at least three business days following receipt by Parent of the notice required pursuant to clause (x) above, and taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent since receipt of such notice, the Companys Board of Directors maintains its determination described in clause (w) above. 

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely qualifying or modifying the Company Recommendation, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as forth in Section 8.1(d). 

  

 6.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will (and will cause its Affiliates to) promptly and in all events done in a manner to be successfully accomplished and completed prior to the Outside Date, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining all necessary consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Entities or other Persons, including responding to additional inquiries or requests for additional information from any Governmental Entity; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any contract or agreement. Each party shall also (and will cause its Affiliates to) refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action (including making acquisitions), that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of any of the conditions to the Merger in this Agreement being satisfied or restrict such partys ability to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.7 _Regulatory Filings_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Without limiting the generality of the obligations of the parties pursuant to Section 6.6, the parties shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from any parties to any contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) in seeking and obtaining any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith. To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent promptly shall notify and provide a copy to the other party of any written communication received from any Governmental Entity with respect to any filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filing or any such transaction. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the applicable Governmental Entity, without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or participate. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearance, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to this Agreement in connection with proceedings under or related to the HSR Act. 

  

 (b) The parties (i) shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken under the Exchange Act and state securities or applicable Blue Sky Laws in connection with the Merger, and (ii) promptly shall prepare and file all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings, and use all reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents from any Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the Merger. 

  

 (c) In the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Company hereby agree to the prompt use of their respective reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate, oppose or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such consummation by the Outside Date. In addition, Parent and the Company shall promptly use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would 

   ##### 

  

    

delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section
6.7, reasonable best efforts shall include, without limitation, (i) the
defense through litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court,
agency or other proceeding by any person, entity or Governmental
Entity, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions and (ii) except for the Divestiture (as
defined below) by Parent of any assets or businesses of Parent that would
have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of
Parent on a post-Merger basis, the offer and agreement by Parent and the
Company, regardless of the consideration, to divest, sell, license or
otherwise dispose of (including holding separate pending such disposition)
(collectively, " _Divestiture_ "), and, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, to effect the Divestiture prior to the
Outside Date of, such assets, control, categories of assets or businesses or
any or all other segments of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
Parent and the respective Subsidiaries thereof (and the entry into agreements
with, and submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving
effect thereto) if such action in whole or in part (A) results in obtaining
clearance under the HSR Act and (B) removes any such actual, anticipated or
threatened injunction or other objection (which would have the effect of
delaying beyond the Outside Date or preventing the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment prior to the Outside Date. In no event shall any
Divestiture be required, which is not conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. 

  

 (d) Subject to (i) Section 6.7(a), (ii) Parents use of its reasonable best efforts pursuant to Section 6.7(c) and (iii) compliance with the other provisions of Section 6.7(c), Parent shall have the right to (i) propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the Divestiture of such assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or eithers respective Subsidiaries as may be required to resolve such objections, suits, orders, decrees, decisions, determinations or judgments and (ii) determine and direct the strategy and process by which the parties will seek required approvals under the Antitrust Laws. 

  

 6.8 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with and obtain the approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) of the other party before issuing any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release prior to such consultation and approval, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares of either party on 

   ##### 

  

    

any securities exchange or national automated quotation system, in which case
the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement shall use reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the
other party before issuing any such press release or making any such public
announcement; provided, however, that each of Parent and the Company may make
any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Parent and the Company and do not reveal non-public
information regarding the other party. 

  

 6.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director, officer and employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant hereto if it shall be determined that the Indemnified Party acted in bad faith and not in a manner such Indemnified Party believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. 

  

 (b) For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit of the Companys directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least A that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") covering each such person currently covered by the officers and directors liability insurance policies of the Company on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage; provided, further, that if the annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed 250% of such annual premium, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Parent may satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.10(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy from an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least A under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that are no less favorable than those of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the intended beneficiaries as those contained in the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.10 applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 6.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10). 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.10 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. 

  

 6.11 _Employee Benefits_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, all Employee Benefit Plans and all Employee Agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of not less than eighteen months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its current or future Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) (the " _Company Employees_ ") (i) salary and bonus that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to such Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation or benefits) that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing herein shall require Parent to continue any particular Employee Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment or termination thereof (subject to the requirements of this Section 6.11); provided, however, that Parent shall not take, or cause to be taken, any action (by way of amendment, termination or otherwise) which is in violation of the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan or applicable Law, nor shall Parent take, or cause to be taken, any such action which requires the consent, waiver or agreement of the affected employee (or such employees beneficiary or dependent) without first obtaining such consent, waiver or agreement. 

  

 (b) For all purposes (other than benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Employees after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New Plans_
"), except as would result in a duplication of benefits, each Company
Employee shall be credited with all years of service for which such Company
Employee was credited before the Effective Time under any similar Employee
Benefit Plan. In addition and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction of any other
eligibility requirements, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
(A) coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under an Employee Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) such
Company Employee has satisfied all applicable waiting time and
other eligibility requirements under the Old Plan that is being replaced by
the New Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and any expenses
incurred by any Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan; provided, however, that if the
plan year of the Old Plan and plan year of the New Plan are not the same,
Parent shall only be required to use reasonable efforts to cause expenses
incurred to be taken into account under the New Plan if such expenses would
have been taken into account under the New Plan if the employee had been
enrolled in the New Plan at the time such expense was incurred. 

  

 (c) At the request of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Savings Plan(s)_ "), effective at least five days prior to the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such Company Savings Plan(s) be terminated, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Savings Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Board of Directors of the Company or its Subsidiary, effective at least three days prior to the Effective Time, (ii) Parent shall cause one or more of the New Plans that constitute a qualified defined contribution plan maintained for the benefit of participants under such terminated Company Savings Plans (the " _Parent Savings Plan(s)_ ") to accept tax-free rollovers from such Company Savings Plan(s) with respect to accounts of the Company Employees, which rollover may consist of cash, a promissory note (as described below) or any combination thereof from such Company Savings Plan(s); (iii) none of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall place any such participants Company Savings Plan loan into default or declare a default with respect to any plan loan solely by reason of the termination of the Company Savings Plan(s) so long as such participant transfers such participants account balance under such terminated Company Savings Plan(s), together with the promissory note evidencing the plan loan and the applicable loan documentation, to the Parent Savings Plan(s) through a direct rollover on or as soon as administratively possible after the Effective Time, and prior to the time required by ERISA or the Code; (iv) Parent shall cause all active participants under the Company Savings Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time to be eligible immediately following the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time to participate in a Parent Savings Plan; and (v) the parties hereto shall
amend the Company Savings Plan(s) and the Parent Savings Plan(s) to effect
the foregoing provisions. 

  

 (d) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with Parent or its current or future Subsidiaries (including the Company) and no provision of this Section 6.11 shall create any third party beneficiary rights. 

  

 6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company RSUs pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.13 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting Sections 6.3, 6.6 and 6.14, subject to applicable Law, the Company agrees to (i) provide reasonable cooperation, and to cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and employees to provide reasonable cooperation and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to provide reasonable cooperation, in connection with the arrangement of any financing to be consummated in order to fund the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (each, a " _Financing_ "), including without limitation, reasonable participation (at Parents sole cost and expense) in meetings and road shows; making available information relating to the Financing reasonably requested by Parent; and reasonable assistance (at Parents sole cost and expense) in the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and similar documents of Parent. Parent will use reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries which may result from the requests for access, data and information under this Section 6.13(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company be required to provide any cooperation with any Financing that involves the registration of any securities of the Company under the Securities Act. 

  

 (b) Parent agrees to use its best efforts to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions no less advantageous than those described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any alternative financing) has not 

   ##### 

  

    

been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to
consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections
7.1 and 7.2 of this Agreement and to Parents rights under applicable
subsections of Section 8.1. 

  

 6.14 _Disqualified Individuals_. Not later than 30 days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a list of each "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 who may be entitled to receive parachute payments, as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code, but without regard to Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code in connection with the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.15 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
