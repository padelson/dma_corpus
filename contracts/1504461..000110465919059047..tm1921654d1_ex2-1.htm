Section 2.3 _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Representative shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement")
setting forth in reasonable detail Seller Representative's good faith
estimate (and attaching supporting schedules, work papers and all other
relevant material details to enable a review thereof by Buyer) of the
following items: (a) Cash (the "Estimated Cash"), (b) Working Capital (the
"Estimated Working Capital"), (c) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness
(including an estimate of the Blocker Income Tax Amount) as of the Effective

of the Estimated Closing Statement, Seller Representative and the
Company shall, and shall cause the other Acquired Entities to, cooperate in
good faith to answer any questions and resolve any issues raised on behalf of
Buyer in connection with their review of the Estimated Closing Statement and
supporting information, and Seller Representative and Buyer may, by mutual
written agreement, amend the Estimated Closing Statement to reflect resolution
of any such issues; _provided_ that, if Seller Representative and Buyer are
not able to reach a mutual agreement prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated
Closing Statement provided by Seller Representative to Buyer pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 2.3 shall be binding and control for purposes
of the Closing, and will be used for purposes of calculating the Initial
Purchase Price to be delivered at Closing.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date,
_provided_ that such ninety (90) day period shall be automatically
tolled during any period in which Sellers fail to afford, or cause its
Affiliates to fail to afford, to Buyer access pursuant to Section
2.4(c), Buyer shall deliver to Seller Representative a statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Buyer's good faith
calculation (and attaching supporting schedules, working papers and all other
relevant material details to enable a review thereof by Seller
Representative) of the following items (each a "Closing Item"): (i) Cash (as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, "Final Cash"), (ii)
Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, the
"Final Working Capital"); (iii) the aggregate amount of Indebtedness as of
the Effective Time (but in the case of clause (g) of the definition of
Indebtedness, as of the Closing) (as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.4, "Final Indebtedness"); (iv) the aggregate amount of Transaction
Expenses to the extent not paid prior to or at Closing (as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4, the "Final Transaction Expenses"), (v) the
aggregate amount of Leakage (as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.4, the "Final Leakage"), (vi) the Post-Effective Time Capital Contribution
Reimbursement Amount (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, the
"Final Post-Effective Time Capital Contribution Reimbursement Amount"), (vii)
the aggregate amount of Reorganization Liabilities (as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4, the "Final Reorganization Liabilities"),
and (viii) the resulting calculation of the Final Purchase Price. Buyer
agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Closing
Statement becomes conclusive and binding upon the Parties in accordance with
this Section 2.4, it will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to) take any
actions with respect to any books, records, policies or procedures on
which the Closing Statement is based or on which the Closing Statement is to
be based that are materially inconsistent with or that would materially
impede or delay the determination of the amount of the Final Cash, the Final
Working Capital, the Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses, the
Final Leakage or the preparation of the Dispute Notice (defined below) or the
Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods required by this
Agreement.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(b) Seller Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days
after Seller Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement (the
"Review Period") within which to review Buyer's calculation of the Closing
Items; _provided_ that, the Review Period shall be automatically tolled
during any period in which Buyer fails to afford, or causes the Acquired
Entities to fail to afford, Seller Representative access required by Section
2.4(c) below. If Seller Representative disputes any of the Closing Items,
Seller Representative shall notify Buyer in writing of its objection to such
Closing Item(s) within the Review Period, together with a description in
reasonable detail of the basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items
(in the case of the dollar amount, to the extent possible) (a "Dispute
Notice"). The Closing Items, as set forth in the Closing Statement, shall
become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless Seller
Representative delivers to Buyer a Dispute Notice within the Review Period.
If Seller Representative timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the
Closing Statement not objected to by Seller Representative in the Dispute
Notice (or by Buyer as a result of the items disputed by Seller Representative
in any such Dispute Notice) shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties, and Buyer and Seller Representative shall, within thirty (30)
calendar days following Buyer's receipt of such Dispute Notice (the
"Resolution Period"), use commercially reasonably efforts to attempt to
resolve in writing their differences with respect to the matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice (and any matters with respect to the Closing Items which
Buyer is disputing as a result of the matters set forth in the Dispute
Notice, or any disputed matters arising out of the foregoing) and any such
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If, at the
conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute, then each
of Buyer and Seller Representative shall submit all items remaining in
dispute to Ernst and Young LLP, or if it is unwilling or unable to serve then
to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Seller Representative (as applicable, the "Valuation Firm") for resolution by
delivering within fifteen (15) calendar days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period to the Valuation Firm their written position with respect to
such items remaining in dispute. The fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm
shall be allocated based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually
contested by such Party in the written presentation to the Valuation Firm. For
example, if Buyer claims an amount of $1,000, and if Seller Representative
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Valuation Firm
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested,
then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated 60% (
_i.e_., 300/500) to Seller Representative and 40% ( _i.e_., 200/500) to Buyer.
The Valuation Firm shall determine, based solely on the submissions by Buyer
and Seller Representative, and not by independent review, only those issues
set forth in the Dispute Notice (and those raised by Buyer in response
thereto) that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such
disputed item which is equal to or between the final values proposed by Buyer
and Seller Representative in their respective submissions. The Parties shall
request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with respect to all
disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days after the submissions of the
Parties, as provided above, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The
final determination with respect to all dispute items shall be set forth in a
written statement by the Valuation Firm delivered to Buyer and Seller
Representative and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties
except in the case of manifest error. Buyer and Seller Representative shall
promptly execute any reasonable engagement letter requested by the
Valuation Firm and shall each cooperate fully with the Valuation Firm,
including by providing the information, data and work papers used by each
Party and its Representatives (including accountants) to prepare or calculate
the Closing Items, making its personnel and accountants reasonably available
to explain any such information, data or work papers, so as to enable the
Valuation Firm to make such determination as quickly and as accurately as
practicable.

  



  

(c) From and after Seller Representative's receipt of the Closing
Statement until the Closing Items are finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.4, Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their respective
auditors, accountants and other Representatives shall be permitted reasonable
access to the Acquired Entities and their auditors, accountants, personnel,
books and records and any other documents or information reasonably requested
by Seller Representative in connection with the review and analysis of the
Closing Statement and the resolution of disputes in connection therewith
(including the information, data and work papers used by Buyer or the
Acquired Entities' auditors or accountants to prepare and calculate the
Closing Items). From and after Closing until the Closing Items are finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, Buyer, their respective
Affiliates and their respective auditors, accountants and other
Representatives shall be permitted reasonable access to the Sellers and
their auditors, accountants, personnel, books and records and any other
documents or information reasonably requested by Seller Representative in
connection with the preparation, review and analysis of the Closing Statement
and the resolution of disputes in connection therewith (including the
information, data and work papers used by Sellers their respective auditors or
accountants to prepare and calculate the Estimated Closing Statement).

(such excess amount, if any, the "Excess Amount"), within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.4, (i) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay directly to
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by Seller Representative, an aggregate amount equal to the Excess
Amount and (ii) Buyer and Sellers shall direct the Escrow Agent to release to
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by Seller Representative, all funds in the Adjustment Escrow
Account.

  



  

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase
Price (such shortfall amount, if any, the "Shortfall Amount"), within three
(3) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4, Buyer and Sellers shall direct the Escrow Agent
to release (i) to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated by Buyer, an aggregate amount equal to the
Shortfall Amount (solely to the extent of the funds available in the
Adjustment Escrow Account) and (ii) to Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller
Representative, any funds that remain in the Adjustment Escrow Account
following the distribution contemplated by the preceding clause (i).

  



  

(f) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be deemed
an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Closing Transactions_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place by conference
call and by exchange of electronic signature pages by email at 9:00 a.m.
Mountain Time on the first Business Day after the later of (a) the date on

permissible, waived in writing by the Party entitled to the benefit of the
same (other than those conditions which by their terms are required to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) and (b) the date that is thirty (30) days after delivery by
Seller Representative of the notice to XTO required by Section 7.15(b)

Section 6.1 _Organization; Authority; Enforceability_. Buyer is a
limited liability company duly incorporated under the Laws of the State of

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all
related fees and expenses, Buyer, Buyer Parent and the Acquired Entities will
be Solvent immediately after consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Investment Intent._

  



  

  

(a) Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent understands and acknowledges
that the acquisition of the Purchased Equity involves substantial
risk. Buyer, Buyer Parent and their respective Representatives have
experience as investors in Equity Interests and other securities of companies
such as the ones being purchased pursuant to this Agreement, and Buyer and
Buyer Parent can bear the economic risk of its investment (which Buyer and
Buyer Parent acknowledges may be for an indefinite period) and has such
knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that each of Buyer
and Buyer Parent is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
respective investment in the Purchased Equity.

  



  

(b) Buyer is acquiring the Purchased Equity for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view toward, or for sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof, or with any present intention
of distributing or selling any Purchased Equity, in each case, in violation
of the federal securities Laws, any applicable foreign or state securities
Laws or any other applicable Law.

  



  

   

41

 



    



  

(c) Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent qualifies as an "accredited
investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the
Securities Act.

  



  

(d) Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent understands and acknowledges
that the Purchased Equity has not been registered under the Securities
Act, any United States state securities Laws or any other applicable foreign
Law. Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent acknowledges that such securities may not
be transferred, sold, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any other
provision of applicable United States federal, United States state, or other
Law or pursuant to an applicable exemption therefrom. Each of Buyer and Buyer
Parent acknowledges that there is no public market for the Purchased Equity
and that there can be no assurance that a public market will develop.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Funds_. On or prior to the date hereof, Buyer has
delivered to Seller Representative true and complete signed counterpart(s)
of (a) commitment letter(s), dated as of the date hereof, providing for debt
financing in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and a
redacted version of all related fee letters (with only the fee amount, cap and
securities demand provisions redacted, such commitment letters and fee
letters, collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letters"); and (b) the Purchase
Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among Buyer Parent and the
purchasers thereto (the "Class D Preferred Agreement"), providing for a
preferred equity investment of up to $200,000,000.00 by the purchasers
thereof (the "Preferred Investment"), which debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, together with the Preferred Investment, shall be
sufficient to pay in cash the Initial Purchase Price (as may be adjusted after
the Closing pursuant to Section 2.4) in accordance with the terms hereof, and
all other amounts to be paid by Buyer hereunder. As of the date hereof, the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Preferred Investment are in full force and
effect, are not subject to any contingencies or conditions that are not set
forth therein, have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded, or
otherwise amended, modified or supplemented in any respect (and no such
amendment, withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated), and, with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letters in the form provided to Seller
Representative, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer,
and to the knowledge of Buyer, each other party thereto, except as the same
may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally or (ii) applicable
equitable principles (whether considered in an action at law or in equity or
otherwise). Other than the Debt Commitment Letters (and related fee letters),
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any Contract or
arrangement which imposes any contingencies or conditions which would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the funding of the debt financing
contemplated by such Debt Commitment Letters or pursuant to which any Person
has the right to withdraw, terminate or rescind, or otherwise amend, modify
or supplement the terms of such commitments. As of the date hereof (and
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III, Article IV and Article V hereof), to Buyer's Knowledge, no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach under any term or condition (as applicable) of
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Preferred Investment, and Buyer has
no reasonable basis to believe that any portion of the financing pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letters or the Preferred Investment will not be available
at Closing or that consummation of the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
Buyer and Buyer Parent is prohibited by or conflicts with any of the material
indebtedness of Buyer Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer or an Affiliate
thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all commitment or other fees
required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid by the date hereof and has
sufficient cash or readily available funds to pay any other fees required by
the Debt Commitment Letters and the Preferred Investment when due. Buyer has
not entered into any obligation, commitment, restriction or Liability of any
kind that might reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect its
ability to have such debt financing or equity financing as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letters and the Preferred Investment, respectively,
immediately available as of the Closing Date.

nor any of their respective employees, agents, Representatives, financing
sources or Affiliates has, without the prior written consent of Hillstone

relation of any member of the Company Group prior to the date hereof for the
purposes of discussing any member of the Company Group in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Buyer Parent Undertaking_. A true and complete copy of the
Buyer Parent Undertaking has been attached hereto in the form of Exhibit
H. The execution and delivery of the Buyer Parent Undertaking by Buyer Parent
has been duly authorized in accordance with the Governing Documents of Buyer
Parent. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer Parent are
necessary to approve and authorize and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Buyer Parent Undertaking.

by (x) committing to and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets, securities, facilities
or other properties as are required to be divested in order to facilitate the
expiration or termination of the HSR Act waiting period and otherwise obtain
all applicable merger control clearances under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Laws and (y) contesting and resisting and seeking to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any order of any Governmental Entity that is in effect
that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required (i) to hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or divest any
of their respective businesses, product lines or assets, (ii) to agree to any
limitation on the operation or conduct of their respective businesses or (iii)
to waive any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.6 (any such action or
limitation described in _clauses (i)_ ,  _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ are referred to
as a "Restriction", other than Restrictions that solely apply to the business
of the Company Group from and after the Closing Date and that relates solely
to physical assets of the Company Group (such Restrictions, the "Target
Restrictions")). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be entitled to all
proceeds of any divestiture or Target Restriction that is required by this
Section 7.2 if the Closing occurs and Sellers shall be entitled to the
Initial Purchase Price, as adjusted for the Final Purchase Price.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Buyer and Buyer Parent
shall not, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and ultimate
parent entities not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with or into
or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity
in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets or Equity Interests, if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to, (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the
risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.3 _R andW Insurance Policy_.

  



  

(a) Buyer has acquired a binding agreement (the "Binder Agreement")
to be issued at Closing of a buyer-side representation and warranty insurance
policy (the "RandW Insurance Policy"), attached as Exhibit I, naming Buyer as
the "named insured". Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy the conditions set forth in the Binder Agreement to ensure that the
RandW Insurance Policy is fully bound and in full force and effect at the
Closing.

  



  

(b) In connection with the RandW Insurance Policy, Buyer covenants
and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts not to, and to ensure
that its Affiliates do not, take any action (or omit to take any action) the
effect of which would, or could reasonably be expected to, void, materially
impair or otherwise abrogate any of the coverages provided or made available
pursuant to or under the RandW Insurance Policy and Buyer covenants and agrees
not to, and to ensure that its Affiliates do not, amend the
subrogation provisions in the RandW Insurance Policy in a manner adverse to
Sellers. The cost of obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including all
premiums and any related brokers fees, shall be paid by Buyer at or prior to
the Closing. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall notify Seller
Representative in connection with any claim made by Buyer under the RandW
Insurance Policy and to the extent requested in writing, Seller
Representative shall, and shall cause Sellers and their Affiliates to, at
Buyer's sole cost and expense, use good faith efforts to reasonably cooperate
with Buyer in connection with any claim made by such Person under the RandW
Insurance Policy.

Section 7.4 _Survival; Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) None of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto) shall survive the Closing, other than each covenant and
agreement set forth in this Agreement that by its terms is to be performed at
or following the Closing, which shall survive the Closing until fully
performed. No party hereto or any of its respective Affiliates shall have any
Liability with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
from and after the time that such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement ceases to survive hereunder; _provided_ that, the foregoing
shall not limit (i) any claim or recovery that may be available to Buyer
under the RandW Insurance Policy or (ii) any claim of Fraud.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the remedies provided in Section
2.4, Section 7.4(a) and Section 7.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
for any and all claims against any party hereto to the extent arising under,
out of, related to or in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 2.4(b), this Section 7.4,
Article VIII and Section 9.10, each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action that it or any of their respective Affiliates may have
against the other party hereto or any of its Affiliates or its or their
respective Representatives with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, whether under any contract, misrepresentation, tort, or strict
liability theory, or under applicable Law, and whether in Law or in equity.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

  

(a) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities required to be filed
after the Closing Date. To the extent any Pass-Through Tax Return required to
be filed after the Closing Date relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Straddle Period), Buyer shall cause such Tax Returns to be
prepared in a manner consistent with the applicable Acquired Entity's past
practice and deliver a copy of each such Pass-Through Tax Return to Seller
Representative for review and approval no later than thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions). No failure or delay of Buyer in providing such Tax
Returns for Seller Representative to review shall reduce or otherwise affect
the obligations or Liabilities of Sellers pursuant to this Agreement except to
the extent Sellers are actually prejudiced by such delay or failure. Buyer
shall incorporate all reasonable comments received from Seller Representative
prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions); _provided_ that, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use the "interim closing method" under Section 706 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to any
applicable Straddle Period Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company (and any of its applicable
Subsidiaries) shall, in Buyer's sole discretion, make an election under
Section 754 of the Code for the taxable year of the Company (or any such
Subsidiaries) including the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 7.5(a), Sellers, at their sole cost and expense, shall be
solely responsible for filing all of the Tax Returns required to be filed by
any Seller and paying all of the Taxes due and owing by any Seller (including
to the extent attributable to income of the Company Group that flows up to
Sellers).

  



  

(b) Buyer shall notify Seller Representative of receipt of a
written notice of any pending or threatened Tax Proceeding with respect to
any Acquired Entity if such Tax Proceeding relates to any Pass-Through Tax
Return, in each case for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Straddle
Period) ("Tax Contest"). Seller Representative shall have the right, at its
own expense, to elect in writing, within ten (10) calendar days of receiving
Buyer's notice, to control any Tax Contest with respect to a Pass-Through Tax
Return for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date ("Seller Tax
Contest"). Buyer shall have the right to participate in any Seller Tax
Contest at Buyer's expense. Seller Representative shall not settle any Seller
Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall control any Tax
Contests that are not Seller Tax Contests ("Buyer Tax Contest").
Seller Representative shall be kept informed by Buyer with respect to any
Buyer Tax Contest and shall have the right to participate in any Buyer Tax
Contest at Seller Representative's expense. Buyer shall not settle any Buyer
Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Seller Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

   

48

 



    

  



  

(c) Each party hereto shall cooperate (and cause its Affiliates to
cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by each
other party hereto, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 7.5 and any Tax Contest with respect to
Taxes and payments in respect thereof. Such cooperation shall include the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Following the Closing, Buyer agrees to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Seller Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority. Each party hereto shall furnish the other Parties with
copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in
connection with any Tax Contest.

  



  

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, goods and
services, stamp, registration, notarial fees and other similar Taxes and fees
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by
Seller, it being understood that Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied its
obligation pursuant to this Section 7.5(d) as a result of _clause (e)_ in
the definition of "Transaction Expenses." Buyer will file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and,
if required by applicable Law, Sellers and Buyer will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate and join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

  



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Income Tax deductions
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including with respect to the payment of Transaction Expenses, any other
compensatory payments, any unamortized capitalized financing costs and
expenses relating to the Acquired Entities' existing Indebtedness that will be
paid at Closing (including any loan fees, any costs related to the redemption
of any Indebtedness, any costs related to prepayment penalties or premiums and
any accrued (and not previously deducted) original issue discount on any
Indebtedness), shall be reported on the income Tax Returns of the Acquired
Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the case of any income Tax Return
of any of the Acquired Entities that does not end on the Closing Date, such
expenses shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(f) The Parties agree that the purchase and sale of the Direct
Company Interests is intended for all applicable Income Tax purposes to be
treated as the purchase and sale of partnership interests. Within sixty (60)
days of the determination of the Final Working Capital, Buyer shall provide
to Seller Representative a schedule allocating the Final Purchase Price among
the assets of the Company Group (the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule")
for Seller Representative's review and consent. The Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule will be prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Code. Any disagreement with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
that cannot be resolved by the Parties shall be resolved by the Valuation Firm
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(b). The Parties shall
make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule to
reflect adjustments to the Final Purchase Price. The Parties agree for all Tax
reporting purposes (including Section 755 of the Code) to report the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the agreements
herein and the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to
the preceding sentence, and not to take any position during the course of any
audit or other Proceeding inconsistent with the agreements as to Tax treatment
herein or with such schedule unless required by a determination of the
applicable Governmental Entity that is final.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

  

(g) Any transactions occurring or actions taken on the Closing
Date but after the Closing by, or with respect to, any Acquired Entity
shall be treated (and consistently reported by the Parties) as occurring in a
Post-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(h) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Acquired Entities
to, without the prior written consent of Seller Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i) file or
amend any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any
Straddle Period) except in accordance with Section 7.5(a); (ii) voluntarily
approach any Taxing Authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Straddle Period); or (iii) make or change any Tax election or
accounting method with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including any Straddle Period); provided, that Buyer
shall not be required to obtain the prior written consent of Seller
Representative with respect to any such action that (x) arises incidentally
as a result of Buyer's filing of Tax Returns of an Acquired Entity
with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period consistent with the past practice
of such Acquired Entity, or (y) is reasonably required in connection with an
audit or other Tax Proceeding initiated by a Taxing Authority (which shall be
governed by Section 7.5(b)).

  



  

Section 7.6 _Press Release_. Any press or other public release or
public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall not
be issued by the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates and
Representatives, in each case, without the consent of each of Buyer and
Seller Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Except in connection with the procurement of any
necessary consents, approvals, Payoff Letters and similar documentation,
the parties hereto shall keep the terms of this Agreement confidential,
except to the extent required by applicable Law and except that (a) the
parties hereto may disclose such terms to their respective accountants, legal
advisors, equityholders, employees and other Representatives as necessary in
connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long
as such Persons agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential) and
(b) Buyer may disclose such terms to the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letters and the Class D Preferred Agreement to the extent necessary for Buyer
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and
the Preferred Investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if any public
release or public announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which any party hereto's or their Affiliates'
securities are traded or quoted, no such consent is required if, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the disclosing party hereto (or
Affiliate thereof) uses its commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate or
communicate such press release or public statement with Buyer or Seller
Representative on behalf of the non-disclosing parties hereto, as applicable,
prior to such public release or public announcement and (b) a party hereto
(or Affiliate of a party hereto) may, without consultation or consent,
issue a public release or public announcement that is consistent with the
prior public releases or public announcements made in compliance with this
Section 7.6; _provided_ , that, with respect to immediately preceding clause
(b), any usage of a party hereto (or its Affiliates') name shall require the
prior written consent of such party hereto.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each party hereto shall be liable for and pay all of its own costs
and expenses (including attorneys', accountants' and investment bankers' fees
and other out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement, the performance of such party hereto's
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ that, Buyer shall pay and be fully responsible for all (a)
filing fees under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws and under any such
other Laws applicable to Buyer and (b) to avoid any confusion, (i) fees,
costs and expenses incurred in respect of the financing by Buyer and its
Affiliates of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) fees, costs and
expenses incurred in respect of the RandW Insurance Policy, (iii) 50% Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.5(d)

(a) Effective upon the Closing, each Seller, on its own behalf,
and on behalf of its post-Closing Affiliates, hereby knowingly and
voluntarily irrevocably waives, releases, and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Acquired
Entities from and against any and all rights, claims, defenses, affirmative
defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, demands, Liabilities, and actions and
causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, which

agents, counsel, accountants, financial advisors, engineers, consultants,
other advisors and successors and assigns of any of the foregoing, whether
known or unknown, to the extent relating to any facts,
conditions, transactions, events or circumstances prior to Closing, in each
case, except in the event of Fraud of Buyer or Buyer Parent; _provided_  that
nothing contained in this Section 7.8(a) shall release, waive, relinquish,
discharge or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any party hereto
to the extent arising under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

  



  

(b) Effective upon the Closing, each Acquired Entity, on its own
behalf, and on behalf of its post-Closing Affiliates, hereby knowingly and
voluntarily irrevocably waives, releases, and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Seller and its post-
Closing Affiliates from and against any and all rights, claims, defenses,
affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, demands, Liabilities, and
actions and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or
unknown, which any such Acquired Entity or its post-Closing Affiliate may
have or assert now or in the future, against the Acquired Entities or any of
their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, members, other
equityholders, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, financial advisors,
engineers, consultants, other advisors and successors and assigns of any of
the foregoing whether known or unknown, to the extent relating to any
facts, conditions, transactions, events or circumstances prior to Closing, in

arising or under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or (ii)
actions and causes of action which any such Acquired Entity or its post-
Closing Affiliate may have against any employees, counsel,
accountants, engineers and consultants of the Company Group and successors
and assigns of any of the foregoing, in each case, to the extent relating to
such Persons' actual intentional fraud or embezzlement of funds against any of
the Acquired Entities prior to Closing.

  



  

Section 7.9 _Directors and Officers_.

  

  



  

  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that (i) each Person that prior to the
Closing served as a director, officer, manager, employee, agent, trustee or
fiduciary of any Seller or Acquired Entity or who, at the request of any
Seller or Acquired Entity, served as a director, officer, manager, member,
employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,

and exculpation to the extent provided in the Governing Documents in effect
as of the date hereof ("DandO Provisions"), (ii) such DandO Provisions are
rights of Contract and (iii) no amendment or modification to any such DandO
Provisions shall affect in any manner the Indemnified Persons' rights, or the
Acquired Entities' obligations, with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Closing.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

  

(b) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase
(at Buyer's sole cost and expense) and maintain in effect for a period of six
(6) years thereafter, (i) a tail policy to the current policy of directors'

tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Closing through and
including the date six (6) years after the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing,
and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and
amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in
the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such current policy and (ii)
"run-off" coverage as provided by the Acquired Entities' respective fiduciary
and employee benefit policies, in each case, covering those Persons who are

retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the
coverage provided under the Acquired Entities' existing policies
(collectively, the  "Tail Policy"); _provided_ , that, in no event shall the
total cost of any such policy exceed 275% of the annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by the Acquired Entities for such insurance, and, if the total
cost for such insurance exceeds such amount, then Buyer may obtain, or cause
to be obtained, insurance with the maximum coverage available for a
total cost of such amount.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing
until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall provide or cause to be made available reasonable access to
Seller Representative and Sellers all books, records, Tax Returns and
documents of the Acquired Entities (and the assistance of employees
responsible for such books, records and documents) on reasonable
advance notice during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary
for (a) investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of,
defending or prosecuting any Proceeding, (b) preparing reports to Governmental
Entities or (c) such other purposes for which access to such documents is

under this Agreement and any documents referred to herein. Buyer shall (at
its sole expense) cause the Acquired Entities to maintain and preserve all
such Tax Returns, books, records and other documents for six (6) years after
the Closing Date and shall offer to transfer such records to
Seller Representative and Sellers at the end of any such period.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required
to provide any access or information to Seller Representative or Sellers,
their respective Affiliates or any Representatives of any of the foregoing
which Buyer reasonably believes it or, after the Closing, any Acquired Entity,
is prohibited from providing to Seller Representative or Sellers, their
respective Affiliates or Representatives of any of the foregoing by reason of
applicable Law, or which (A) constitutes or allows access to information
protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Buyer or the Acquired
Entities are legally required to keep confidential or (B) Buyer must prevent
access to by reason of a Contract with a third party or which would otherwise
expose Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, each of
the Acquired Entities) to a material risk of Liability. Seller Representative
and each Seller agrees to treat as confidential and safeguard all confidential
and proprietary information of the Acquired Entities provided pursuant to
this Section 7.10 (and to instruct each of its Representatives that

_provided_ that the foregoing confidentiality obligation shall not apply to
information that (i) becomes publicly available through no breach by Seller
Representative or any Seller of this Agreement, (ii) is disclosed to Seller
Representative, any Seller or their respective Affiliates by a third party
(provided such third party is not in breach of any confidentiality obligation
in respect of such information), (iii) is independently developed by
Seller Representative, any Seller or their respective Affiliates or (iv) is
disclosed for purposes of compliance with any Seller's or its Affiliates'
respective financial reporting obligations or for such other bona fide
fundraising, marketing, information or reporting activities by such Seller or
its Affiliates consistent with past practices and the recipients of such
information are subject to customary obligations of confidentiality with
respect to such information that is confidential; _provided further_ , that,
in the event Seller Representative, any other Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates is required by Law or becomes legally compelled
(including by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena,
civil investigation, order or other legal process) to disclose any of such
information, such Person may do so without liability hereunder so long as, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (x) such Person promptly notifies
Buyer prior to any such disclosure and (y) reasonably cooperates with Buyer,
at Buyer's sole expense, in any attempts it may make to obtain a protective
order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will
be afforded such information.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

Section 7.11 _Insurance_. Buyer shall be solely responsible from and
after the Closing for providing insurance to the Acquired Entities and their
respective business for events or occurrences occurring after the Closing.
Subject to Section 7.12, Buyer acknowledges that all insurance arrangements
maintained by Sellers and their respective Affiliates (not including the
Acquired Entities) for the benefit of the Acquired Entities and their
respective Affiliates, if any, will be terminated as of the Closing and no
further business interruption, property or Liability shall be covered under
any such insurance arrangements.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Retained Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Sellers may, or may cause any of the Acquired Entities to, prosecute
the Retained Claims prior to the Closing in their sole discretion. All
amounts (including refunds) awarded or otherwise paid to, or recovered by, any
of the Acquired Entities, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
(prior to, at, or after the Closing) in connection therewith shall be
referred to as the "Retained Claims Amounts", and all such Retained Claims
Amounts shall be for the benefit of Sellers as provided herein, and,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including Section
7.1(a), Sellers may, at any time at or prior to the Closing, distribute,
transfer, dispose of, extinguish or otherwise exclude from the Acquired
Entities the Retained Claims and any and all Retained Claims Amounts
attributable thereto. To the extent that Sellers do not distribute, transfer,
dispose of, extinguish or otherwise exclude from the Acquired Entities the
Retained Claims at or prior to the Closing, from and after Closing, (i) to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, without the prior written
consent of Seller Representative, Buyer hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
agree not to exercise any rights that they may have that arise from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of any Retained Claims or any
other agreement in connection therewith, including any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy in respect of the Retained Claims, whether
or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under Contract, statute
or common Law, including the right to take or receive, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
any payment or security on account of the Retained Claims and (ii) (A) Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) shall reasonably
cooperate with, and shall take reasonable instructions and direction from,
Seller Representative in connection with the prosecution of the Retained
Claims from and after the Closing and (B) Seller Representative shall
reimburse Buyer for any reasonable and documented third party out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses to the extent incurred or paid by any Acquired
Entity following the Closing in respect of such prosecution of Retained Claims
(excluding any such fees, costs and expenses to the extent included as part
of Transaction Expenses) within fifteen (15) Business Days following the end
of each month for so long as such prosecution of Retained Claims continues
following the Closing. Promptly after Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Acquired Entities following the Closing) receives any Retained
Claims Amounts attributable to the Retained Claims, (i) such Retained Claims
Amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of Sellers and in connection
therewith segregated from the other property, assets and funds of Buyer and
its Affiliates (including any Acquired Entities following the Closing) and
(ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause their respective applicable Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities from and after the Closing) to, promptly pay
such Retained Claims Amounts directly to Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by
Seller Representative.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Employee Matters_. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company Group to, provide each employee of any
member of the Company Group set forth on Schedule 7.13 ("Continuing
Employees") with a base annual salary or wage rate that is no less than the
base annual salary or wage rate that is in effect for such employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, annual cash bonus opportunities that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than the annual cash bonus
opportunities provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2019, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Group to, provide the
Continuing Employees with employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the benefits provided under the Company Employee Benefit Plans
and any other plans, programs, or arrangements available to such employee as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ that, for those employees of the
Company Group whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement, such employees' terms and conditions of
employment shall continue to be so governed. Buyer further agrees that, from
and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Group to,
grant each Continuing Employee with credit for any and all service with
the Company Group (and any predecessor thereof) earned prior to the Closing
Date (a) for eligibility and vesting purposes and (b) for purposes of
vacation and paid time off accrual and severance benefit determinations under
each benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may
be established or maintained by Buyer or any Acquired Entity on or after the
Closing Date (the "New Plans"). In addition, Buyer hereby agrees that Buyer
shall, or shall cause the applicable Acquired Entity to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition
exclusion and actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under
any Company Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) cause any
deductible, co-insurance and out-of-pocket covered expenses paid on or before
the Closing Date by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to
be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable New Plan in the year of initial participation. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights
(including any third-party beneficiary rights), remedies or claims upon any
employee of any Acquired Entity, any Continuing Employee or any other Person,
other than the Parties to this Agreement, or shall constitute an amendment to
or any other modification of any New Plan or Company Employee Benefit Plan.
Buyer agrees and acknowledges that all collective bargaining agreements in
effect at any Acquired Entity as of the Closing Date will continue in
effect after the Closing Date in accordance with their terms and with
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and
the Acquired Entities shall be solely responsible for any obligations arising
under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9.

Section 7.14 _Section 280G of the Code_. At least three (3) days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall seek, and use reasonable best efforts
(which shall not include any payment of monies or granting of any
accommodation, financial or otherwise) to obtain, a waiver of the right to
receive payments and benefits that would reasonably be expected to constitute
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (a "Parachute Payment
Waiver") from each individual whom the Company reasonably believes is, with
respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) such that after giving effect to all Parachute
Payment Waivers, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has made or
provided, or is required to make or provide, any such payments or benefits in
excess of 299% of such individual's "base amount" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code); _provided_ that such Parachute Payment Waiver shall
not include any payments or benefits that may be made by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates unless at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Buyer
provides a detailed list and copy of any agreement, contract or arrangement
that Buyer or its Affiliates are providing or entering into on or prior to
the Closing Date with respect to any disqualified individual in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, along with a written description,
satisfying the adequate disclosure requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii)
of the Code, of any such agreement, contract or arrangement and amount of
related  "parachute payment." Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts (which shall not include any payment of monies or
granting of any accommodation, financial or otherwise) to obtain the approval
of the equityholders of the Company in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G
of the Code inapplicable to payments or benefits that, in the absence of the
executed Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected disqualified individuals,
might otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any
amount or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason
of Section 280G of the Code. At least three (3) days prior to soliciting
Parachute Payment Waivers and equityholder approval under this Section
7.14, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and equityholder
approval materials to Buyer for its review and comment (and shall not
unreasonably omit any comments timely provided by Buyer).

replacement guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds or other
assurances of payment with respect to the Credit Support Obligations in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller Representative and the

may elect (but is not obligated) to replace the XTO Letter of Credit prior to
Closing by providing written notice thereof to Seller Representative and, if
Buyer so elects to replace the XTO Letter of Credit prior to Closing, Buyer
shall replace the XTO Letter of Credit in full in its entirety with a
replacement letter of credit in substantially the same form as the letter of

Contract, and (b) obtain a complete and unconditional release of Sellers and
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller Representative, with respect to all such Credit Support

the credit support provided by certain GGC affiliated funds outstanding as of
the date hereof that is for the benefit of First Republic Bank in respect of
the XTO Letter of Credit). Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain counterpart signature pages from XTO to the Buyer Parent
Undertaking prior to Closing.

  



  

(b) On the date hereof or promptly thereafter, Seller
Representative shall provide formal confirmation to XTO (i) of a Change
of Control (as defined in the Hillstone Undertaking) under and pursuant to

conditions described therein as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, including (i) maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii)
negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the financing contemplated

with the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or on

not materially less favorable, and (C) do not modify the terms in such a way
as would reasonably be expected to make the funding of the financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to funding) less likely to occur in
any material respect, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis (or obtain the
waiver of) (on a timely basis) all the conditions to the financing (and
complying with all the obligations) contemplated by the Debt Commitment

55

 



    



  

  

(b) Buyer shall give Seller Representative prompt notice of (i)
any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result
in breach or default) of the Debt Commitment Letters or other Debt Document
by any party thereto of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) if and when Buyer
becomes aware that any portion of the financing contemplated by any Debt
Commitment Letter would reasonably be expected to not be available to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the receipt of,
together with copies of, any written notice or other written
communication from any Person on behalf of any party to any Debt Commitment
Letter or any Affiliate thereof with respect to any (A) actual or potential
material breach, default, termination, rescission or withdrawal by any party
to any Debt Commitment Letter or (B) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to any Debt Commitment Letter or other Debt Document (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the financing or Debt Documents), (iv) if for any
reason Buyer believes in good faith it will not be able to obtain any portion
of the financing on the terms, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by any Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto (such definitive agreements related to the debt financing or
any Substitute Financing, collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letters, the
"Debt Documents") and (v) any amendments, replacements or supplements to any
Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the obligation to provide such information
without request as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, as
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days
after the date Seller Representative delivers to Buyer a request therefor,
Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller
Representative (and that is in Buyer's Knowledge and possession) relating to
any circumstance referred to in _clauses (i)_ through _(v)_ of Section
7.16(b);  _provided_ that nothing in this Section 7.16(c) shall require Buyer
to disclose any information that is subject to the attorney-client privilege
or the disclosure of which would result in the breach of any of Buyer's
confidentiality obligations set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. Without
limiting the foregoing, upon the request of Seller Representative, Buyer
shall keep Seller Representative reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
financing.

  



  

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during
the Pre-Closing Period, (i) if funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, or it becomes
reasonably likely that such funds may become unavailable, to Buyer on the
terms and conditions set forth therein or (ii) if Buyer, in its reasonable
discretion and in consultation with Seller Representative, elects to fund the
transactions contemplated hereby using financing sources alternative to the
Debt Commitment Letters, in the case of each of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ ,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller Representative and shall, and shall cause
Buyer's Affiliates to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
substitute or alternative (as applicable) financing (each, a "Substitute
Financing"), including from alternative sources, on similar terms sufficient
to enable Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with its terms and to pay related fees, expenses earned, due
and payable at the Closing Date on terms not less favorable in the
aggregate to Buyer than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters that
the Substitute Financing would replace (taking into account any  "flex"
provisions) from the same or other sources and which do not include any
incremental conditionality to the consummation of such Substitute Financing
that are more onerous to Buyer, Sellers and the Acquired Entities (in each
case, in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters in effect as of the date of this Agreement. In the event of a
Substitute Financing, all obligations of Buyer with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letters set forth in this Section 7.16 shall immediately, and
without any further action by the parties hereto, apply with respect to such
Substitute Financing and any related commitment letters or similar
instruments, provided, any such obligations with respect the Debt Commitment
Letters so replaced shall immediately, and without any further action by the
parties hereto, terminate.

(including seeking specific performance) and (iii) not permit, without the
prior written consent of Seller Representative, any amendment or modification
to be made to, or any material waiver of any provision or remedy under, any
Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Document (it being understood and agreed that
only such amendment, modification or waiver that (individually or in the
aggregate with any other amendments, modifications or waivers) would
reasonably be expected to (x) materially reduce the amount of financing
available under any Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Document (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount thereof),
(y) impose any new or additional condition, or otherwise amend, modify or (z)
expand any term or condition to the receipt of any portion of the financing
in a manner that could reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the
Closing Date, (II) make the funding of any portion of the financing (or
satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the financing) less
likely to occur in any material respect or (III) materially impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against any other party to any Debt
Commitment Letter or Debt Document, the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be material for the
purpose of this clause (iii)).

  



  

(f) Neither Buyer nor Buyer Parent shall take any action
(including the incurrence of any indebtedness) that would prohibit, delay or
limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Parent to consummate the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Buyer and Buyer Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of each of the applicable lenders party to that
certain Amended and Restated Credit Facility, dated as of February 14, 2017,
by and among NGL Energy Partners, LP, NGL Energy Operating LLC, the
subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Deutsche Bank Trust Company

Parent to consummate the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the
financing, or any Substitute Financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the financing
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters or any Substitute Financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 2.6. In the
event that all conditions to the Debt Documents have been satisfied, Buyer
shall cause its Financing Sources to fund the financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date
(including taking enforcement actions, including seeking specific
performance, to cause such Financing Sources to provide such financing).

required for the types of debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters and (iv) furnishing Buyer and its Financing Sources and potential
lenders under the Debt Commitment Letters with (x) the financial statements
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in Section 5 of the Summary of Conditions Precedent in

the analogous provision in any amendment, modification, supplement,
restatement or replacement thereof permitted or required pursuant to Section
7.16, provided that the conditions set forth in such analogous provision
shall be substantially identical to those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date of this Agreement) and (y) such other
pertinent financial and other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the extent reasonably available to the Company, as Buyer or
its Financing Sources shall reasonably request in order to consummate the
financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or as is customary for
the arrangement of loans contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters;
_provided_ that, Buyer shall not distribute any marketing materials to any
potential lenders or other parties without first providing Seller
Representative with the opportunity to review and comment thereon.

with the ongoing operations of any Seller (or the Acquired Entities), (ii)

satisfied or otherwise causes any breach of this Agreement or any Material
Contract to which Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates is a party,

Acquired Entities) to take any action that could reasonably be expected to
conflict with or violate its respective Governing Documents or any Law or
result in a material violation or result in any breach of or
default thereunder (or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both could constitute a breach of or default thereunder), or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
thereunder, (v) involve any binding commitment by Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), (vi) involve any
binding commitment by any Acquired Entity which commitment is not conditioned
on the Closing and does not terminate without Liability to Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) upon the termination
of this Agreement, or (vii) require the delivery or execution of any
agreement by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the

the Acquired Entities after the Closing).

  



  

   

58

 



    

  



  

(c) Sellers shall have satisfied its obligations under this

respective Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) and its and their

with respect to the financing contemplated by the Class D Preferred Agreement
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Class D Preferred

REMEDIES OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY OR WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT) ARE PERMITTED TO ANY PERSON AS A RESULT OF THE
MISREPRESENTATION OR BREACH OF ANY SUCH REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, (x) NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR SELLERS
NOR THE GGC BLOCKERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY REGARDING ANY
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY RIGHTS OR OTHER RIGHTS WHICH BUYER MIGHT CLAIM UNDER
ANY STUDIES, REPORTS, TESTS OR ANALYSES PREPARED BY ANY THIRD PARTIES FOR
SELLERS, THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, EVEN IF
THE SAME WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW BY BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES; AND (y) NONE OF THE DOCUMENTS, INFORMATION OR OTHER
MATERIALS PROVIDED TO BUYER AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY FORMAT BY THE ACQUIRED
ENTITIES, SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE, AND BUYER WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
ASSERT THAT IT RECEIVED ANY LEGAL ADVICE FROM THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES,
SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
REPRESENTATIVES OR COUNSEL, OR THAT IT HAD ANY SORT OF ATTORNEY-
CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF SUCH PERSONS.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 7.21 is intended to limit or modify the representations
and warranties contained in ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV and ARTICLE V of this
Agreement or in any certificates of any Seller, the Company or the GGC
Blockers delivered hereunder or any claim by a Party for Fraud of another
Party.

  



  

Section 7.22 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document, agreement,
or instrument delivered contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the
fact that any Party may be a partnership or limited liability company, each
Party, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no Persons (including no Financing Sources) other than
the Parties (and Buyer Parent for the limited purposes set forth herein)
shall have any obligation hereunder and that it shall have no rights of
recovery hereunder against, or in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith, against, any Financing Source or
any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, manager,
assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, Representative or
employee of any Party (or any of their successors or permitted assignees),
against any former, current, or future general or limited partner, manager,
stockholder or member of any Party (or any of their successors or
permitted assignees) or any Affiliate thereof or against any former, current
or future director, officer, agent, employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, Representative, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of any of the foregoing, but
in each case not including the Parties (each, but excluding for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a "Non-Party Affiliate"), whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim
(whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of such Person
against the Non-Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable
Law, or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
Liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred
by any Non-Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of the applicable
Party under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth in, and subject in all cases to the
terms and conditions of and limitations herein, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action of any kind based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities
that are expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-
Party Affiliate is expressly intended as a third-party beneficiary of this
Section 7.22.

Section 7.23 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or shall cause to
be executed and delivered, such documents and other instruments that are
necessary to consummate (a) the transfer of the Purchased Equity to Buyer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (b) the Pre-Signing
Reorganization and the Pre-Closing Reorganization in accordance with the
terms of the Reorganization Agreements and (c) the transactions
contemplated by the Hillstone Asset Assignment and the IP Assignment.

  



  

Article VIII _ 
 TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing only as follows:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller Representative and
Buyer;

  



  

(b) by either Seller Representative or Buyer by written notice to
the other if any applicable Law is in effect making the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or any final and non-appealable order
is in effect permanently preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any Party
whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this
Agreement results in or causes such order or other action;

  



  

(c) by either Seller Representative or Buyer by written notice to
the other if the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not have occurred on or before November 30, 2019 (the "Outside Date");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to (i) any Party then in material
breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, or (ii) Buyer, if Seller Representative is entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

  



  

(d) by Seller Representative, if Buyer breaches in any material
respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would render a condition precedent to Sellers' obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 2.6(a)
or Section 2.6(c) not capable of being satisfied and (ii) after the giving of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform to Buyer by Seller
Representative, cannot be cured or has not been cured by the earlier of the
Outside Date and twenty (20) calendar days after the delivery of such
notice;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to Seller Representative if
the Company, Sellers or the GGC Blockers are then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

  

(e) by Buyer, if the Company, Sellers or the GGC Blockers breach
in any material respect any of their respective representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Company, Sellers or the GGC
Blockers breach or fail to perform in any material respect any of their
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform (i) would render a condition precedent to Buyer's
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in
Section 2.6(a) or Section 2.6(b) not capable of being satisfied and (ii)
after the giving of written notice of such breach or failure to perform to
Seller Representative by Buyer, cannot be cured or has not been cured by the
earlier of the Outside Date and twenty (20) calendar days after the delivery
of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available to Buyer if
Buyer is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

(f) by Seller Representative if: (i) all of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 2.6(a) and Section 2.6(b) were satisfied or
waived as of the date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing and could have been satisfied or would have
been waived assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) Seller Representative has
notified Buyer that Sellers, the Company and the GGC Blockers are ready,
willing and able to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing within two (2)
Business Days after the delivery of such notification by Seller
Representative; _provided_  that the Closing shall not take place prior to
the thirtieth (30th) day following the date Seller Representative
delivers the notice to XTO required by Section 7.15(b) in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become null and void, without
any Liability on the part of any Party or any other Person, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease; _provided_ that, (a) the
Confidentiality Agreement and the agreements contained in Section 7.6, Section
7.7, this Section 8.2 and Article IX of this Agreement shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect and (b) no
such termination shall (i) relieve any Party from any Liability arising out of
or incurred as a result of its breach of the terms of this Agreement prior to
such termination or (ii) impair the right of any Party to compel in
accordance with this Agreement specific performance by any other Party of such
Party's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) Seller
Representative pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f) or (ii) Buyer at
a time when Seller Representative may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f), then, at Seller Representative's option,
(x) Sellers shall be entitled to retain the Deposit or (y) Sellers shall be
entitled to seek specific performance, an injunction or other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security or needing to prove irreparable
harm) to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in accordance with Section 9.10. While Seller
Representative may pursue both a grant of specific performance under this
Section 8.2(b) and retain the Deposit under this Section 8.2(b), under no
circumstance shall Seller Representative be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance and to retain the Deposit in connection
with the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

   

64

 



    

  



  

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the
agreements contained in Section 8.2(b) and this Section 8.2(c) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) Buyer and Sellers have
expressly negotiated the provisions of Section 8.2(b) and this Section
8.2(c), (ii) in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the
execution of this Agreement (including the inability of the Parties to
quantify the damages that may be suffered by Sellers and their respective
Affiliates), the provisions of Section 8.2(b) and this Section 8.2(c)
are reasonable, (iii) the Deposit represents a good faith, fair estimate of
the damages that Sellers and their respective Affiliates would suffer, and
(iv) the Deposit shall represent liquidated damages (and not a penalty)
without requiring Sellers or any other Person to prove actual damages.

  



  

(d) Without limiting Seller Representative's rights under Section
8.2(b), including the right of Seller Representative to seek specific
performance, and injunction or other equitable relief, the right of Sellers to
retain the Deposit shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers against
Buyer for any monetary damage suffered by Sellers in connection with a
termination pursuant to, or when a termination is possible under, Section
8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f).

  



  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the Parties'
rights under this Section 8.2, Section 9.10 or elsewhere under this
Agreement, for all purposes of this Agreement, the failure of Buyer to
consummate the Closing when required and to make the payments required by
Section 2.6(c)(iv) when required shall be a breach of this Agreement by
Buyer that is not capable of being cured, that has prevented consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including if such failure results from
Buyer being unable to obtain all or any portion of any contemplated financing
for the transactions contemplated hereby or failing to take all actions when
and in the manner required of it hereunder), and that gives rise to Seller
Representative's termination right pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section
8.1(f).

  



  

Article IX _ 
 MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 9.1 _Non-Solicitation_. For a period of two (2) years
commencing on the Closing Date, each Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Affiliates (which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, exclude HEP
ShaleApps), to directly or indirectly, (a) hire or solicit any employee of
the Company Group or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or
hire any such employee who has left such employment or (b) enter into any
contract with any of the Restricted Customers for any purpose that could
reasonably be expected in any material respect to impair or otherwise
adversely affect any of the Acquired Entities' business with such
Restricted Customers pursuant to the Material Contracts with such Restricted
Customers in effect as of the date hereof and listed on Schedule
3.9(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in _clause (a)_ of
this Section 9.1 shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from (w)
hiring any employee whose employment has been terminated by a member of the
Company Group after the Closing Date; (x) after one hundred and eighty (180)
days from the date of termination of employment, hiring any employee whose
employment has been terminated by such employee, (y) conducting general
solicitations for employment or other services contained in a newspaper,
other periodical or on the internet, so long as such solicitations are not
specifically targeted at employees or consultants of the Acquired Entities or
their Subsidiaries or (z) hiring employees or consultants as a result of such
employees or consultants contacting Sellers or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives on their own initiative without any direct or indirect prior
solicitation or targeting by Sellers or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives.

Section 9.2 _Amendment and Waiver_. No amendment of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by Buyer and Seller Representative. No waiver of any provision or
condition of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the party hereto against which such waiver is to be
enforced. No waiver by any party hereto of any default or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder, whether intentional
or not, shall be deemed to extend to any other, prior or subsequent default
or breach or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
other, prior or subsequent such occurrence. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, this Section 9.2, Section 9.9(b), Section 9.11 and
Section 9.16 and the definition of "Financing Sources" (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of Section 9.2, Section 9.9(b), Section
9.11 and Section 9.16) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner
that is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the adversely affected Financing Source.

  



  

Section 9.3 _Notices_. All notices, demands, requests, instructions,
claims, consents, waivers and other communications to be given or delivered
under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered (or, if
delivery is refused, upon presentment), received by email (with hard copy to
follow) prior to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on a Business Day (or the next
Business Day if after 5:00 p.m.), (b) on the next day if delivered by
reputable overnight express courier (charges prepaid), or (c) three (3)
calendar days following mailing by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid and return receipt requested. Unless another address is specified in

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that, neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto (including by operation of Law)
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that upon prior written notice to Seller Representative, Buyer
shall be entitled to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement
to its Affiliates or for collateral security purposes to any lender party to
the Debt Documents to Buyer in connection with funding the transactions
contemplated hereunder, but in each case, no such assignment shall relieve
Buyer of its obligations or Liabilities hereunder. In the event the Company or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and assigns of
the Company shall be deemed to have assumed the obligations set forth in
Section 7.9.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under
applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit
attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set
forth in this Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean
"including without limitation." The use of the phrase "Ordinary Course of
Business" shall mean, with respect to any Person, any action taken by such
Person in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The
use of the word "or" shall mean "and/or." Except where otherwise
expressly provided, all amounts in this Agreement are stated and shall be
paid in United States currency. Each obligation of a Seller or the Company
under this Agreement to cause Hillstone - Silcor Treatment, LLC or HEP Hidden
Bench Holdco, LLC to take, or refrain from taking, any action shall be deemed
limited to the extent of the direct or indirect rights of such Seller or the
Company, as applicable, as a member of such Acquired Entity (or its parent)
or rights with respect to the Representatives appointed by such Seller, the
Company or their respective Affiliates to the board of directors, board of
managers or similar governing body of such Acquired Entity to cause such
Acquired Entity to take, or refrain from taking, any applicable action,
subject in all cases to any duties or other obligations set forth in (and
solely to the extent the exercise of such rights would not reasonably
be expected to result in a breach of) the applicable operating agreement or
other Governing Document of such Acquired Entity or applicable Laws. The
parties hereto and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and
adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person.

  



   

67

 



    

  

  



  

  

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and
documents referred to herein contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written
or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, Liabilities and obligations with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in Contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to
any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, this
Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arm's-length negotiations and no Person has any special
relationship with another Person that would justify any expectation beyond
that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length
transaction.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and
agreements, certificates, instruments and documents entered into in
connection herewith may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts
and by email, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement. No party hereto shall raise
the use of email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
email as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a Contract and each
party hereto forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) The Laws of the State of Delaware shall exclusively govern (i)
all claims or matters related to or arising from this Agreement (including
any tort or non-contractual claims) and (ii) any questions concerning the
construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Agreement,
and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Agreement, in each case
without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law rules or
provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all
rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or Proceeding brought to
resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties (whether arising in
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, connected with, related or
incidental to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby OR the
relationships established among the parties hereunder. THE PARTIES FURTHER
WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL
COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS
FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or
the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in
respect of the Proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court and
agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this Section 9.9(a), however, shall
affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each party hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at equity.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.9(a) to the contrary,
each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any
legal action, suit or proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Documents or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court or
federal court sitting in the County of New York and the Borough of Manhattan
(and appellate courts thereof).

  



  

Section 9.10 _Specific Performance_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 8.2(b), each party hereto acknowledges that the rights of each
party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed (including by Buyer Parent) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages would be
inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching party hereto would have
no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-breaching party hereto would be
irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that each other
party hereto shall be entitled to specific performance (including in respect
of Buyer Parent), an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of
bond or other security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition
to any other remedy to which such Person may be entitled.

  



  

Section 9.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person,
other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, any legal or
equitable rights hereunder, except for the third party beneficiaries
enumerated in Section 7.8, the Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 7.9
and Non-Party Affiliates pursuant to Section 7.22 and the Financing Sources
pursuant to Section 9.2, Section 9.9(b), this Section 9.11 and Section 9.16.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Legal Representation_. Sellers, Buyer and the Acquired
Entities hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their current and
future directors, managers, members, partners, officers, equityholders,
employees and Affiliates and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that each of Kirkland and Ellis LLP
("KandE") and Nob Hill Law Group, P.C. ("NHLG") (or any successor thereto) may
represent Sellers or any direct or indirect director, manager, member,
partner, officer, employee, equityholder or Affiliate thereof, in connection
with any dispute, Proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any agreement entered into in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby (any such representation, the "Post-Closing
Representation") notwithstanding its representation (or any continued
representation) of the Acquired Entities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities
on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any
objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Buyer and the
Acquired Entities each acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies
whether or not KandE or NHLG provides legal services to the Acquired Entities
after the Closing Date. Each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities, for itself
and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications among KandE, NHLG, the Acquired Entities, Sellers or any
director, officer, manager, member, equityholder, employee or Representative
of any of the foregoing made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs solely to Sellers and may be exclusively controlled by
Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Acquired Entities,
and from and after the Closing none of Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer, the Acquired Entities
or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process.
From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Acquired Entities, on
behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, irrevocably waives and will not
assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication among
KandE, NHLG, the Acquired Entities, Sellers or any director, officer,
manager, member, equityholder, employee or Representative of any of the
foregoing occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer or the Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and a third
party other than Sellers, on the other hand, Buyer and the Acquired Entities
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Buyer nor the Acquired Entities may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Sellers.

Section 9.13 _Schedules_. All Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto or
referred to herein and the Recitals to this Agreement are (a) each hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein and (b) qualified in their entirety by reference to
specific provisions of this Agreement. Any fact or item disclosed in any
Section of the Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in each other Section of
the Schedule to which such fact or item may apply so long as (x) such other
Section is referenced by applicable cross-reference or (y) it is readily
apparent that such disclosure from the face of such disclosure is
applicable to such other Section or Schedule. The headings contained in the
Schedules are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
modify or influence the interpretation of the information contained in the

Section 9.14 _Seller Representative_.

  



  

(a) By execution hereof, Hillstone Parent and the Selling Blocker
Equityholders each (i) irrevocably constitutes and appoints Hillstone Parent
as Seller Representative to act as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on its
behalf regarding any matter under this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including: (A) delivering and receiving
notices, including service of process, with respect to any matter under this
Agreement; (B) executing and delivering any and all documents and taking any
and all such actions as shall be required or permitted of Seller
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, including any and all such
documents and actions with respect to the final determination of any
adjustment of the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4; (C)
providing notice of, demanding, pursuing or enforcing, in its discretion, any
claim, including specific performance in accordance with the terms of Section
9.10, against Buyer for a breach of this Agreement; (D) taking, in its
discretion, any and all actions, and delivering and receiving any and all
notices hereunder, in respect of or in connection with any claim for Losses,
including the negotiation, settlement or compromise of any disagreement or
dispute with Buyer in respect thereof; (E) withholding funds to pay expenses
and obligations arising in its capacity as Seller Representative; (F)
executing and delivering, on behalf of Sellers, any Contract, agreement,
amendment or other document or certificate, including any settlement
agreement or release of claims, to effectuate any of the foregoing or as may
otherwise be specifically permitted by this Agreement, any such Contract,
agreement, amendment or other document or certificate to have the effect of
binding Sellers as if each Seller, as applicable, had personally entered into
such agreement; (G) taking all such other actions as Seller Representative
shall deem necessary or appropriate, in its discretion, for the accomplishment
of the foregoing and the transactions contemplated by the Escrow Agreement;
and (H) engaging such attorneys, accountants, consultants and other Persons as
Seller Representative, in its discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to
accomplish any action required or permitted of it hereunder, and (ii) agrees
to be bound by all agreements and determinations made by and documents
executed and delivered by Seller Representative pursuant to the authority
granted to it hereunder.

(b) Seller Representative will not be liable for any act taken or
omitted to be taken as Seller Representative, while acting in good faith, and
any act taken or omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be
conclusive evidence of such good faith. Seller Representative shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements
furnished to Seller Representative by Sellers, the Company, Buyer, the GGC
Blockers, or any third party or any other evidence deemed by Seller
Representative to be reliable, and Seller Representative shall be entitled to
act on the advice of its selected counsel. Seller Representative shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement
or any related document or agreement if Seller Representative shall have
received such advice or concurrence as it deems appropriate with respect to
such inaction, or if Seller Representative shall not have been expressly
indemnified by Sellers to his satisfaction against any and all Liability and
expense that Seller Representative may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. Sellers hereby agree to indemnify Seller
Representative from any Losses arising out of service in its capacity as
Seller Representative hereunder.

  



  

(c) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.14, from and
after the Closing, Buyer is entitled to deal exclusively with
Seller Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and related
agreements. The Selling Blocker Equityholders shall not have any rights to
participate in the resolution of such matters in any manner. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of Seller Representative constitutes a decision of
Sellers. Such decision, act, consent or instruction is final, binding and
conclusive upon Hillstone Parent and the Selling Blocker Equityholders, and
Buyer and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of Seller Representative without any Liability to, or obligation
to inquire of, any Seller (other than Seller Representative in its capacity
as such). The appointment and power of attorney made in this Section 9.14
shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law be deemed an agency
coupled with an interest and all authority conferred hereby shall to the
fullest extent permitted by Law be irrevocable and not be subject to
termination by operation of applicable Law, whether by the death or incapacity
or liquidation or dissolution of Hillstone Parent or the Selling Blocker
Equityholders or the occurrence of any other event or events. Any
action taken by Seller Representative on behalf of Hillstone Parent or the
Selling Blocker Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement shall be as valid as
if any such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event had not
occurred, regardless of whether or not Hillstone Parent, Seller
Representative, the Company, the GGC Blockers, the Selling Blocker
Equityholders, any related Person or Buyer shall have received notice of any
such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event. Notices or
communications to or from Seller Representative will constitute notice to or
from Hillstone Parent and the Selling Blocker Equityholders.

  



  

(d) In the event of the incapacity of Seller Representative,
Seller Representative or his trustee, receiver or personal Representative, as
applicable, shall promptly designate a substitute and its written notice to
Sellers of such substitute, which substitute shall from the time of such
designation have all the rights and responsibilities of Seller Representative
hereunder, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if for any reason no
successor Seller Representative has been appointed pursuant to the foregoing
within fifteen (15) days after such incapacity, Buyer shall have the right to
appoint a substitute (which substitute shall be one of the Sellers) to serve
as Seller Representative until Seller. Any amounts paid by Buyer (including
any amounts payable related to the post-Closing adjustments under Section
2.4) to Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers, or in accordance with
its instructions, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement, shall be
deemed to have been paid to the Sellers, and Buyer shall have no
further liability to Seller Representative or Sellers with respect to such
funds.

Section 9.15 _Buyer Parent Guaranty._

  



  

(a) As a material inducement to Sellers' willingness to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer
Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to
Sellers as a primary obligation that Buyer shall fully, completely and timely
pay, perform and discharge all of its obligations and Liabilities under this
Agreement and any agreement or other instrument delivered by Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement (the "Obligations"). Upon default by Buyer of any of the
Obligations, Sellers may proceed directly against Buyer Parent pursuant to the
guaranty set forth in this Section 9.15 (the "Buyer Parent Guaranty") without
proceeding against Buyer or any other Person or pursuing any other
remedy, and Buyer Parent shall, upon the written request of Seller
Representative ("Performance Demand"), immediately pay, perform and discharge
such Obligations. A single Performance Demand shall be effective as to any
specific default during the continuance of such default until Buyer or Buyer
Parent shall have cured such default, and additional written demands
concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Buyer Parent Guaranty is an
unsecured obligation of Buyer Parent and no security interest or lien is
granted by Buyer Parent in any of its assets or property to secure this Buyer
Parent Guaranty.

  



  

(b) This Buyer Parent Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and
performance and not of collection. There are no conditions precedent to
the enforcement of this Buyer Parent Guaranty. The obligations of Buyer
Parent hereunder shall be continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable
until the payment and performance in full of the Obligations and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged,
subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any
reason, or otherwise affected by (i) any invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability against Buyer of this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto; (ii) any modification, amendment,
restatement, waiver or rescission of, or any consent to the departure from,
any of the terms of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto; (iii) any exercise or non-exercise by Sellers of
any right or privilege under this Agreement or any other agreement or
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or any notice of such exercise or non-
exercise; (iv) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
release in respect of any Obligation, by operation of law or otherwise, or
any assignment of any Obligation by Sellers; (v) any change in the corporate
existence structure or ownership of Buyer; (vi) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar Proceeding affecting Buyer or Buyer's assets
or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation; (vii) any
requirement that Sellers exhaust any right or remedy or take any action
against Buyer or any other Person before seeking to enforce the
obligations of Buyer Parent under this Buyer Parent Guaranty; (viii) the
existence of any defense, set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
whatsoever, or other rights (other than a defense of payment, performance or
discharge) that Buyer Parent may have at any time against Buyer or any other
Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions; (ix) any
other act or failure to act or delay of any kind by Buyer or any other
Person; or (x) any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the
provisions of this Buyer Parent Guaranty, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of the Obligations or the obligations of Buyer Parent hereunder,
including all defenses of a surety.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(c) This Buyer Parent Guaranty shall continue to be effective, or
be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or
performance, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored, returned or rejected by Sellers for any reason,
including upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or
reorganization of Buyer, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for,
Buyer or any substantial part of Buyer's property, or otherwise, all as
though such payments had not been made. Buyer Parent agrees that it will
indemnify Sellers on demand for all costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Sellers in connection with
such rescission or restoration, which amounts shall be in addition to all
other obligations hereunder. If Sellers are required to refund part or all of
any payment of Buyer with respect to any of the Obligations, such payment
shall not constitute a release of Buyer Parent from any Liability hereunder,
and Buyer Parent's Liability hereunder shall be reinstated to the fullest
extent allowed under applicable Law and shall not be construed to be
diminished in any manner.

  



  

(d) This Buyer Parent Guaranty and the Buyer Parent's obligations
hereunder shall terminate with respect to all Obligations upon the payment
and performance in full of all Obligations. In connection with any such
termination, the Sellers shall promptly execute and deliver to Buyer Parent,
at the Buyer's or Buyer Parent's expense, all documents that Buyer Parent
shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release and shall
perform such other actions as Buyer Parent shall reasonably request to effect
such release. Any execution of such documents shall be without recourse to or
warrant by the Sellers.

  



  

Section 9.16 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. Subject to the
rights of Buyer under the Debt Commitment Letters, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (a) none of the
Financing Sources will have any liability to Sellers or any of their
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) neither Sellers nor any of their
Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any Financing Source
(solely in their respective capacities as Financing Sources) in
connection with this Agreement the Debt Commitment Letters, and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In addition, in no event will
any Financing Source be liable for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive
or indirect damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
9.16 shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of the
Parties under the Transaction Documents, the Buyer Parent's rights under the
Class D Preferred Agreement or any Financing Source's Obligations to Buyer
under the Debt Commitment Letters.
