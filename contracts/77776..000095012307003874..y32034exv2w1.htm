 SECTION 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or the Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (i) Subject to Section 2.1(c), each share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent an amount per share of Company Common Stock (subject to any Taxes (as defined below) withheld pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) equal to $31.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

  

 (ii) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.1(c), all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to exist and shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and retired and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but without limiting the covenants of Section 5.1 hereof), if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and any other relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, or such greater number of shares as Parent shall determine prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _Cancellation of Parent-owned and Merger Sub-owned Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or Merger Sub) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to exist and no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall remain outstanding and no payment shall be made in respect thereof. 

  

 SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Certificates. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company (who is reasonably acceptable to the Company) as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, cash amounts in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make all required payments pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for and upon surrender of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund may not be used for any purpose that is not provided for in this Agreement. 

  

 (a) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days (as defined below) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a), the following: (i) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a letter of transmittal and (iii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, such materials to be in a form substantially similar to that previously reviewed and found reasonably acceptable to the Parent and the Company. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person (as defined below) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a 

   ##### 

  

 

Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or
is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificate, the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(a). No interest will be paid or accrue on the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate. 

   

 (b) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms as may reasonably be required by the Parent or as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, cash in the amount that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered. 

  

 (c) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options (as defined below) or Restricted Stock Units (as defined below) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Code_ ") and/or any other applicable provisions of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, to the applicable Governmental Entity (as defined below), and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company Options or Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (d) _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1) of the MGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger. 

  

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

  

 (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, _provided_ that such investments shall be in direct obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of all principal and interest or commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors or a combination thereof. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall become part of the Exchange Fund and, to the extent the amount held in the Exchange Fund at the end of each month exceeds the amount remaining to be paid by the Company pursuant to Section 2.1(a), such excess shall be paid to the Parent within five (5) Business Days of the end of each such month. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required to make prompt cash payments of the Merger Consideration as required by Section 2.1(a) hereof, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the Exchange Fund for any amount lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 As used in this Agreement: 

  

 " _Agreed Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality restrictions no less favorable to the Company (i.e., no less restrictive with respect to the conduct of such Person) than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below), and which does not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or restricting the Company from complying with Section 6.4 of this Agreement. 

  

 " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, to the extent made or commenced after the date hereof, and in each case, other than the Merger, a tender offer or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company and its Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures, or any proposal or offer to acquire (whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) in any manner (i) an equity interest representing a 20% or greater economic interest or voting interest in the Company and its Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures, taken as a whole, or (ii) assets, securities or ownership interests of or in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures (a) representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures, taken as a whole, or (b) with respect to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable.

failure to make such disclosure would constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company Board makes any
such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) without expressly publicly reaffirming, without qualification, the
Company Board Recommendation by the date that is the earlier of (i)
ten Business Days after the first to occur of the receipt by the Company of
such Company Acquisition Proposal and the making public of such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) five Business Days prior to the date of the

 (x) the Company Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted that, due to an intervening event that arose after, and was unknown to the Company Board at the time of, its approval of this Agreement the failure of the Company Board to so withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with the statutory duty of the Company Board members, as directors, under the Maryland General Corporation Law, then the Company and the Company Board shall be permitted to withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation, or 

   

 (y) the Company Board receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited, that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 6.4(a) or any standstill agreement and that the Company Board determines, in good faith by resolution duly adopted, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, 

 

then, if the Company desires to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement or
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall deliver to the
Parent a Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and shall thereafter negotiate
in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Parent. If (i) after no less than five Business Days after the date of
delivery of the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and (ii) after taking
into account any revised proposals that may be made by Parent since receipt
of the Company Adverse Recommendation Notice (including any amendments to
this Agreement entered 

    ##### 

  

    

into or covenanted to be entered into by Parent), the Company Board shall
have not changed its determination under clause (x) or (y) above (as
applicable) (it being understood that any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new
Company Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three Business Day period

(y) above, or would have (without giving effect to any proposal received by
the Company Board after the delivery of the most recent Company Adverse
Recommendation notice) changed its determination under clause (x) or
(y) above, with respect to any revised proposal made by Parent within the
five or three Business Day period described above (as applicable)), then the
Company may enter into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal only if concurrently therewith, the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) and pays
the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2.

Upon such payment or in the event of a termination of this Agreement in either of the circumstances described in the first sentence of this Section 8.2(e), Parent and Merger Sub shall not have any further liability to the Company with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

   #####

Company Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then the
Company shall pay as promptly as possible (but in any event within two
Business Days) following receipt of an invoice therefor all of Parents
actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent
and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and including
in respect of Parents reimbursement obligations to the Mortgage
Business Purchaser under the Mortgage Business Sale Agreement (" _Parent
Expenses_ ") as directed by Parent in writing, which amount shall not be
greater than $5 million; provided, that the existence of circumstances which
could require the Company Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(d) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.2(f); and
provided, further that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant
to this Section 8.2(f) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(d)
except to the extent indicated in Section 8.2(d). 

  

 (g) As used in this Article VIII, 

  

 " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount of cash equal to $50 million, which shall be paid (when due and owing) by the Company to the Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Parent. 

   

 " _Reverse Termination Fee_ " means an amount of cash equal to $50 million, which shall be paid (when due and owing) in accordance with Section 6.03 of the Mortgage Business Sale Agreement.

 (b) The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights, power or remedy provided under this Agreement, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice or the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.
