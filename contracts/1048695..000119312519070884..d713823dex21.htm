(b) _Company Shares_.

(i)  _Generally_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Company
Securityholders or any other Person, each Company Share (excluding Cancelled

1.3(b)(ii)_, and Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in the manner set

2.3(b)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(v)_, and  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(viii)_,
respectively, (the " _Contributed Amounts_ ") and subject to potential

pursuant to the terms of  _Section 2.4_, (the " _Additional Amounts_ ") upon
the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and throughout this Agreement
and cancellation of the Book-Entry Entitlements in respect thereof and
the Exchange Documents all in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_.
Until so cancelled, each Book-Entry Entitlement shall be deemed, for all
purposes after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive
the applicable Total Per Share Consideration (subject to reduction for any
applicable Contributed Amounts and to increase for any Additional Amount)
payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_ and the other terms of
this Agreement. For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the
applicable Total Per Share Consideration payable to each Company Shareholder
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_, (x) all shares of the Company
Shares held by each such Company Shareholder shall be aggregated on a book-
entry-by-book-entry basis and (y) the amount of cash to be paid to each
Company Shareholder for each Book-Entry Entitlement of such Company
Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) _Cancelled Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, the Company
Securityholders or any other Person, each share of Company Shares that is
issued and outstanding and held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the

pursuant to section 179 of the BVI Act, each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights of a shareholder of the Company except the
right to be paid the fair value of his shares as shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of Section 179 of the BVI Act. If any
Company Securityholder (other than a Company Securityholder who consented in
writing to the Requisite

 



-3- 

    

 Shareholder Approval) fails to give written notice of its election to
dissent from the Merger under Section 179 of the BVI Act, then the rights of
such Company Securityholder under Section 179 of the BVI Act shall cease to
exist, and the underlying Company Shares shall be cancelled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_, and shall entitle the holder thereof only to
receive compensation in accordance with such _Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(i)_. The
Company shall give Buyer prompt notice, and in any event notice within one (1)
Business Day, of any notice or purported notice received by the Company of any
Company Securityholders intent to exercise and/or exercise of rights
pursuant to Section 179 of the BVI Act, the withdrawal of any such notice and
any other documents served upon the Company pursuant to or in connection with
Section 179 of the BVI Act or a Company Securityholders dissent or appraisal
rights and Buyer shall have the right to direct on behalf of the Company all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal or
dissent. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld) or as
otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of
competent jurisdiction, make or offer to make any payment with respect to any
such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such
rights. The payout of consideration under this Agreement to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ (other than to
holders of Dissenting Shares who shall be treated as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(iii)_ and under the applicable provisions of the BVI
Act) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal
rights or dissenters rights by any other Company Securityholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect of
any Dissenting Shares or (ii) incurs any Losses (including reasonable
attorneys and reasonable consultants fees, costs and expenses and including
any such reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding) in
respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) that
have not been paid by the Company prior to the Closing ((i) and (ii)
together " _Dissenting Share Payments_ ") in excess of the amount of cash
that otherwise would have been owed in respect of such shares in accordance
with this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to recover the amount of such
Dissenting Share Payments under the terms (but subject to the limitations) of
_Article_ __ _ IX_ hereof.

(c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) _Vested Company Options_. Each Vested Company Option that is outstanding
and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate
at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, any Company
Securityholder or any other Person, each Vested Company Option that
is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the excess of the Total Per
Share Consideration applicable to a Company Ordinary Share, _less_ the per
share exercise price of such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (B) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Vested Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Company Option Cash Out Amount_ ") subject to reduction for any applicable
Contributed Amounts and to increase for any Additional Amount. The payment of
the Company Option Cash Out Amount to any holder of Vested Company Options
shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under
the Code or any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of such Vested
Company Options.

 



-4- 

    

(ii) _Unvested Company Options_.

 

(A) _Held by Continuing Employees_. Effective as of the Effective Time, each
Unvested Company Option that is held by a Continuing Employee and is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Buyer as a Buyer Option. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each
such Unvested Company Option so assumed by Buyer pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 1.3(c)(ii)(A)_ shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms and any accelerated vesting provisions
that may be applicable thereto) set forth in the Plan and the option
agreements relating thereto (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include
employment agreements, offer letters or side letters entered into by and
between the Company and each such optionee), as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that (x) such assumed Unvested Company Option
shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of Company Ordinary Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock and (y) the
per share exercise price for the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Unvested Company Option shall be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Ordinary
Share at which such assumed Unvested Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the

end of the Resolution Period, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative
shall submit all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute
Statement to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm upon which
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall reasonably agree (the "

between Buyer and the Securityholder Representative, and shall only be
permitted or authorized to determine an amount with respect to any such
disputed item that is either the amount of such disputed item as proposed by

proposed by the Securityholder Representative in the Dispute Statement. Each
of Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall (i) enter into a
customary engagement letter with the Accounting Firm at the time such dispute
is submitted to the Accounting Firm and otherwise cooperate with the
Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity to submit a written statement in
support of their respective positions with respect to such disputed items, to
provide supporting material to the Accounting Firm in defense of their
respective positions with respect to such disputed items and to submit a
written statement responding to the other partys position with respect to
such disputed items and (iii) subject to customary confidentiality and
indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with access to their
respective books, records, personnel and Representatives and such other
information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render its
determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative a written determination (such determination
to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used
in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative) of the disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of
receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be final and binding
on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting Firm will be
allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, first out of the
Expense Fund, and only after the Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the
Indemnifying Parties directly), on the other hand, in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting
Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined
by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total disputed amount of such items so
submitted.

 

(f) _Final Total Closing Consideration_. The Total Closing Consideration,
calculated based on Total Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount as deemed
final and binding on the parties hereto pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_,
is referred to herein as the " _Final Total Closing Consideration_."

 

1.5 _Further Action_. If at any time from and after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors of
the Company, Buyer and Merger Sub, are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

Corporations payroll system in order to effectuate all applicable Tax
withholding obligations on such payments.

 

(c) _Negative or No Adjustment_.

2.5(c)(i)_, or such lesser amount as may be then remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund.

 

(iii) In the event either the Negative Adjustment Amount is less than the

Consideration equals the amount of the Final Total Closing Consideration, then
as soon as reasonably practicable after the determination of the Final Total
Closing Consideration, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall give
the Escrow Agent joint written instructions to promptly deliver to each
Company Securityholder such Persons Pro Rata Portion of the Remaining
Adjustment Escrow Fund Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may choose to

payments in respect of Vested Company Options, through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system in order to effectuate all applicable Tax
withholding obligations on such payments.

 

(d) _Tax Treatment_. Any payment made under this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ to the

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) for any amounts imposed by and
paid over to a Governmental Entity with respect to any such Taxes, together
with any costs and expenses relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys

respects the Companys consolidated financial condition, operating results and
cash flows as of the dates and during the periods indicated therein, subject
in the case of the Interim Financials to normal year-end adjustments, which
are not material in amount or significance in any individual case or in the
aggregate. The Companys unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the
Balance Sheet Date is referred to hereinafter as the " _Current Balance
Sheet_." The books and records of the Company and each Subsidiary have been,

that are set forth in and identifiable by reference to the text of such
contracts, and (d) liabilities for Third Party Expenses. For clarity, in the
event that a third party claim involving the Company or any Subsidiary is
brought following the Agreement Date, the mere existence of such claim shall
not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 3.8_ on the
grounds that the existence of such claim following the Agreement Date means
that the matters underlying such claim by definition constituted an
undisclosed, contingent, unmatured, unaccrued, unasserted or similar liability
of the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

3.9 _No Changes_. Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this

Company nor any Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders fees with
respect to any such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any
existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has performed all of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant
to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or

 



-31- 

    

 other occupancy agreements for real property that are no longer in effect
and has no continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. To
the Companys Knowledge, the Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from structural, physical and mechanical defects,
is maintained in a manner consistent with standards generally followed with
respect to similar properties, and is structurally sufficient and otherwise
suitable for the conduct of the Companys business. Neither the operation of
the Company or any Subsidiary on the Leased Real Property nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real Property, including the
improvements thereon, violate any applicable building code, zoning
requirement or statute relating to such property or operations thereon, and
any such non-violation is not dependent on so-called non-conforming use
exceptions.

3.12 _Tangible Property_ . The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good
and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid
leasehold interests in, all of its tangible properties and assets used or held
for use in its business, free and clear of any Liens, except (a) as reflected
in the Current Balance Sheet, and (b) Permitted Liens. The tangible properties
and assets owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary (i) constitute all
tangible properties and assets necessary for the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently
contemplated to be conducted, and (ii) in good operating condition, regularly
and properly maintained, subject to normal wear and tear.

Company or any Subsidiary and who is or was involved in the creation or
development of any Company IP (including, without limitation, any Person who
has contributed to any Open Source Software on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary) has signed a valid and enforceable agreement containing an
irrevocable assignment of Intellectual Property Rights to the Company or a
Subsidiary, a waiver of moral rights and confidentiality provisions protecting
the Company IP substantially in the Companys Standard Form IP Contract for
employees (a copy of which is attached to _Section_ __ _ 3.13(c)(i)-A _of

")) or substantially in the Companys Standard Form IP Contract for

Company or any Subsidiary in any Company IP to enter into the public domain;

(vii) no Company IP is subject to any proceeding or outstanding decree, order,
judgment or settlement agreement, or stipulation that restricts in any manner
the use, transfer or licensing thereof by the Company or any Subsidiary;

(viii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has assigned or otherwise
transferred ownership of or granted an exclusive license to, or agreed to
assign or otherwise transfer ownership of or grant an exclusive license to,
any Intellectual Property Right that is or was material to the business of
the Company or any Subsidiary to any other Person;

 



-33- 

    

(ix) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently or has been a member
or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or similar
organization that could require or obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to
grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company IP (or
that could, following the Effective Time, require or obligate Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to
any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right); and

 

(x) the Company and each Subsidiary owns or otherwise has, and after the
Closing will continue to have, all Intellectual Property Rights
and Intellectual Property needed to conduct the business of such entity as

(d) _Valid and Enforceable_. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries is listed
at the appropriate Governmental Entity as the sole owner of all Company
Registered IP (excluding Company Registered IP that is exclusively licensed to
the Company) and there are no breaks in chain-of-title documents filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity with respect thereto. All necessary
registration, maintenance and renewal fees with respect to the Company
Registered IP have been paid, and all necessary affidavits, responses,
recordations, certificates, releases and other documents have been filed for
the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting, preserving and renewing
all Company Registered IP and the ownership rights of the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries with respect thereto. There is no basis for a claim that any
Company Registered IP, except for pending applications, is invalid or
unenforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no trademark
(whether registered or unregistered), trade name or domain name owned, used,
or applied for by the Company or any Subsidiary conflicts or interferes with
any trademark (whether registered or unregistered), trade name or domain name
owned, used or applied for by any other Person. None of the goodwill
associated with or inherent in any trademark (whether registered or
unregistered) in which the Company or any Subsidiary has or purports to have
an ownership interest has been impaired.

 

(e) _Effects of This Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any other agreements referred to in this
Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this

Person of any license or other right or interest under, to or in any of the
Company IP or any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has

Registered Intellectual Property, including "small business status," that
would be invalid or inaccurate following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) _No Third Party Infringement of Company IP_. No Person has
infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated, and no Person is currently
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, any Company IP. _Section_
__ _ 3.13(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies (and the
Company has Made Available a true, correct and complete copy of) each letter
or other written or electronic communication or correspondence that has been
sent or otherwise delivered by or to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their respective representatives regarding any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement or misappropriation of any Company IP.

(g) _Use of Licensed IP_. The Company and its Subsidiaries have valid and
subsisting written licenses to use, reproduce, incorporate, distribute,
license, sublicense and provide access to customers in respect of all Licensed

currently proposed to be conducted. No consents are required to be obtained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries from the applicable licensor of an item of
Licensed IP to use, reproduce, incorporate, distribute, license, sublicense
and provide access to customers in respect of the Licensed IP in the manner
and to the extent undertaken by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their businesses as presently conducted or currently proposed to

Subsidiaries with the right to (i) distribute and make available said Company
Products to its customers and potential customers in the manner the Company
currently makes such Company Products available and (ii) grant run-time
licenses to all such customers sufficient for the intended and expected use of
the said products and services. No third party that has licensed Licensed IP
to the Company or any Subsidiary has retained or been assigned an ownership
interest in or any exclusive license to any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights in any improvements or derivative works to such
Licensed IP made solely or jointly by the Company or any Subsidiary.

(h) _No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights_. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, or has ever
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, any Intellectual Property
Right of any other Person. The conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has not infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property Right of any other Person or constituted unfair
competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, and when
conducted in substantially the same manner after the date of this Agreement
will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property Right of any other Person, including patents issuing on
patent applications filed as of the date of this Agreement, or constitute
unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction
(except to the extent due to Companys ownership by Buyer or its affiliates).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) no product or service
ever produced, distributed, used, provided or sold by or on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary has ever infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property Right of any other Person; (ii) no
infringement, misappropriation or similar Action, or any Action alleging
unfair competition or trade practices, is pending or has been threatened
against the Company or any Subsidiary or against any other Person who may be
entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed by the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to such Action; (iii) neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice or other communication (in
writing or otherwise) relating to any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property Right
of another Person, or any actual, alleged or suspected engagement by the
Company or any Subsidiary in unfair competition or trade practices under the
laws of any jurisdiction; (iv) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is bound
by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold harmless or reimburse any other
Person with respect to any infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Intellectual Property Right (other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.13(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule); and (v) no Action involving any Licensed
IP is pending or has been threatened, except for any such Action that, if
adversely determined,

 



-35- 

    

 would not adversely affect (A) the use or exploitation of such Licensed IP
by the Company or any Subsidiary or (B) the distribution, hosting, delivery or
sale of any Company Product. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever
sought or obtained an opinion of counsel regarding any possible infringement,
misappropriation, violation or unlawful use of another Persons Intellectual
Property Rights or the validity or enforceability of another Persons
Intellectual Property Rights.

(i) _Bugs_. None of the Company Technology fails to materially comply with
any applicable warranty or other contractual commitment relating to the use,
functionality or performance of, or any product or system containing or used
in conjunction with, such Company Technology. The Company has Made Available
a true, correct and complete copy of its list as of the Agreement Date of
material bugs, defects and errors in each version and component of the Company

(i) _Section_ __ _ 3.13(k)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule accurately
identifies and describes each item of Company Technology that is subject to
the GNU General Public License, the Affero General Public License, the GNU
Lesser General Public License, the Eclipse Public License, the Common Public
License, the Mozilla Public License, any other license identified as an open
source license by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org), or any
substantially similar license (an " _Open Source License_ ", and such item of
Company Technology, " _Open Source Software_ "), including, for each such
item, (A) identification of the Open Source License to which such item is
subject; (B) whether such item was incorporated into or linked in any Company
IP (and, if applicable, the manner in which such Open Source Software was
incorporated or linked in); (C) whether (and, if so, how) the item was
modified by the Company; (D) whether (and, if so, how) the item was
distributed by the Company.

 

(ii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has used, modified, or distributed

such software on) the disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source code
for any Company IP; (B) imposes any restriction on the consideration to be
charged for the distribution of any Company IP; (C) creates, or purports to
create, obligations for the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the
Company IP or grants, or purports to grant, to any third party, any rights or

attribution and copyright notices, and all such Open Source Licenses have been
Made Available. The Company has Made Available all internal policies and
guidelines related to use of or contributions to Open Source Software.

(l) _Company Source Code_. The Company and each Subsidiary has taken actions
customary in the software industry to document the software that is Company IP
and its operation, such that such software, including its source code and
documentation, have been written in a clear and professional manner so that
they may be understood, modified and maintained in an efficient manner by
reasonably competent programmers. No source code for any Company IP has been
delivered, licensed or made available to any escrow agent or other Person who
is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an

 



-36- 

    

 employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, including under any Open Source

(whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or make
available the source code for any Company IP to any escrow agent or other
Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary. No event has occurred, and no circumstance
or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or
could reasonably be expected to, result in the delivery, license or disclosure
of any source code for any Company IP to any other Person who is not, as of
the date of this Agreement, an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary.

Sites_ "), through any third party websites or services, and by or through any
Company Products, including any Personal Data or Behavioral Data collected by
third Persons and provided to the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company, each
Subsidiary, the Company Sites and the Company Products, and all third parties
acting on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary or that have access

transfer, disposal and any other processing of any Private Data collected,
used, stored, or transmitted by the Company or any Subsidiary, or by third
parties having access to such information. Neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement nor the subsequent transfer of all of the
Companys and each of the Subsidiaries databases and other information
relating to its customers and all non-customer end users of the Company Sites
and the Company Products, including all Private Data, from the Company or the
Subsidiaries to the Surviving Corporation will cause, constitute, or result in
a breach or violation of any Privacy Law by any party to this Agreement, or

Copies of all Company Privacy Policies have been Made Available. The Company
Privacy Policies have at all times made all disclosures to users or customers
required by all Privacy Laws, and Company and each Subsidiary has obtained
all consents from users required by all Privacy Laws. None of the disclosures
made or contained in the Company Privacy Policies, and no other representation

thereon, including, without limitation, Private Data and confidential
information. Such steps and procedures comply with all applicable Laws
relating to the security of information technology assets, Private Data,
confidential information, and other data, information, and Company IP to which
the Company, any Subsidiary or any third party acting on any of their behalves
has access or otherwise collects, handles, transmits, processes,

Subsidiary having implemented, maintained, and monitored reasonable measures
with respect to technical, administrative, and physical security to preserve
and protect the confidentiality, availability, security, and integrity of the
information technology assets, Private Data, confidential information, and
other data, information, and Company IP collected, handled, transmitted,

assessment and management procedures; and conforming with industry best
practices pertaining to secure programming techniques. Neither the Company nor

Subsidiary has implemented the disaster recovery and security plans,
procedures and facilities for such systems specified in _Section_ __ _
3.13(n)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. There is no complaint to, or any Action
(including any informal investigation) currently pending against, the Company,
any Subsidiary or any of their customers (relating to the Company Products)
by (i) any private party or (ii) the Federal Trade Commission, any state
attorney general or similar state official, or any other Governmental Entity,
foreign or domestic, with respect to the security, confidentiality,
availability, or integrity of information technology assets, Private Data,
confidential information, or other data, information or Company IP. There have
been no intrusions or breaches of the security of the information
technology assets, Private Data, confidential information, or other data,
information or Company IP collected, handled, transmitted, processed, or
stored by the Company or any Subsidiary. All Private Data is encrypted in
accordance with Companys and its Subsidiaries contractual commitments and
representations made in the Company Privacy Policies and in accordance with
industry practices regarding encryption technologies and key management
practices.

facilities, platforms and related systems and services used by the Company or

sufficient for the existing and currently anticipated future needs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Systems are in good working condition to
effectively perform all computing, information technology and data processing
operations necessary for the operation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. There have been no internal or external audits of the Companys
Systems or privacy or security practices in which materials exceptions or
deficiencies were noted. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken

safeguards to ensure that the Systems are substantially free from
Contaminants. From and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or its
applicable Subsidiaries will have and be permitted to exercise the same
rights (whether ownership, license or otherwise) with respect to the Systems
as the Company or one of its Subsidiaries would have had and been able to
exercise had the Merger not occurred, without the payment of any additional
amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries would otherwise have been required to
pay.

parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, and
proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or on behalf of any party.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Buyer nor
Merger Sub shall have any obligation to litigate any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding that may be brought in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither Buyer nor any
Affiliate of Buyer shall be required to agree to any license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property
of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, or the imposition
of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses

Company and its Subsidiaries shall not have to agree to take or take any such
actions unless conditioned on the Closing.

 

(c) Buyer shall, in consultation with the Company and subject to _Section_ __
_ 7.2(b)_, determine strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all
activities with respect to seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
of any Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby, and the Company and its

connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding
Buyers rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the prior sentence,

competition Law which would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective
of whether the Merger occurs.

obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any third parties to

provide such access to the extent it could jeopardize any applicable attorney-
client or would result in the breach of a Material Contract to which the
Company is a party or is otherwise bound; _provided_ , _however_ __ that, in
the event the Company withholds or prevents any such access, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer and its Representatives such
requested or sought information or data pursuant to a reasonable alternative
accommodation. The Company agrees to provide to Buyer and its accountants,
counsel and other Representatives copies of internal financial statements

arising out of a breach of this Agreement.

7.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_ . The Company shall give prompt
notice to Buyer of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the

inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time, and (b) any failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each of (a) and (B), such that
the conditions to closing in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)(ii)_, respectively, would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall
not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.13_, however, shall affect or be deemed to qualify, limit,
modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained herein or
in the Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, or the rights of Buyer or any Indemnified Party under or arising
out of a breach of this Agreement. For clarity, unintentional failure to give
notice under this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of
covenant under this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ and shall constitute only a breach
of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition,
as the case may be.

Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement.

Party (or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns,
as applicable).

 

7.15 _Indemnity Insurance Policy_. Buyer shall cause the Indemnity Insurance
Policy to be bound and in full force and effect on the same day of the

this Agreement, or any representative thereof, except against an Indemnifying
Party solely in the case of that Indemnifying Partys fraud in connection with
the Merger. The premiums related to, and all the other costs and expenses
relating to the origination of the Indemnity Insurance Policy (the " _Policy
Premium_ ") shall be

 shared equally by Buyer and the Company ( _provided_ , that, the Company
shall not be required to contribute more than $1,000,000 with respect to such
Policy Premium (the " _Premium Cap_ ")), as and when required in accordance
with the terms of the Indemnity Insurance Policy. The Company shall indemnify
Buyer for 50% of any Policy Premium incurred prior to Closing in the event of
termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (other than
_subsection (f)_ thereof). Buyer shall not amend, modify or otherwise change,
terminate or waive any subrogation, or any other provision, of the Indemnity
Insurance Policy with respect to any Indemnifying Party in any manner that
would be adverse in any material respect to the Indemnifying Parties, without
the prior written consent of the Securityholder Representative. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to Buyer such cooperation reasonably
requested by the Buyer that is necessary to obtain the Indemnity Insurance
Policy.

 

7.16 _Register of Members_. On the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certified copy of its register
of members as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and cause the
register of members of the Company to be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the register of members of the Company after
that time.

7.17 _Registered Agent_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
to Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that the registered agent
of the Company will recognize the authority of Buyer to give instructions in
relation to the Surviving Corporation with effect from the Effective Time,
including for the purposes of (a) updating the corporate records of the
Company to reflect the Merger and the changes to the Companys board of
directors contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_ above and (b) filing any new
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association for the Surviving
Corporation.

7.18 _Export Control Matters_. As promptly as practicable after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will conduct a review of its
exports subject to the Bureau of Industry and Security (" _BIS_ ") and the
Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ") regulations to ensure that it
has no violations under these regulations that have not yet been disclosed to
the relevant agency. The Company shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised of the
status of such review and, on or before the date that is ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, shall provide Buyer with a written report
detailing the results of such review. In the event that the Company identifies
any U.S. export violations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, those matters referenced on
_Schedule 3.20(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) or Buyer gives notice to the
Company that it reasonably believes that any such violations have occurred,
the Company shall, to the extent requested by Buyer in its sole and absolute
discretion, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the
Closing Date, prepare and file with the appropriate agency, including BIS and
OFAC, a written voluntary self-disclosure (" _VSD_ "), in form and substance
satisfactory to Buyer, of (a) any exports by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, if applicable, of products, source code, or technology prior to
obtaining proper authorization for such exports, (b) any exports to
prohibited countries or end-users as identified in the regulations enforced by
BIS and OFAC including, as an example, to entities on the Sectorial Sanctions
list (" _SSI list_ ") that were made without abiding by the required payment
terms, and (c) any other information regarding any export violations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as are identified by the Company or the Buyer.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) _Company Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in the Officers
Certificate shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the third (3rd)
anniversary the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such one-year period,

Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations shall survive until
11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date;
_and_ _provided_ _further_ that that in the event of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to a representation or warranty,
such representation or warranty shall survive until the resolution of any
claims relating thereto; _and_ _provided_ _further_ that all representations
and warranties of the Company shall survive beyond the Expiration Date or
other survival periods specified above with respect to any inaccuracy therein

has been finally resolved.

(b) _Buyer Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Buyer and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
terminate at the Closing (other than those in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ (Non-

of limitations).

(c)  _Contract Supersedes Statutes_. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods
and termination dates in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)-(b)_ supersede

representations and warranties.

9.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after and by virtue of the Merger, the Company Shareholders and
holders of Vested Company Options (together, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ")
shall (on a several and not joint basis according to their respective Pro Rata
Portions up to the amount then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund),
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
including the Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and
against all Losses paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified
Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation) (regardless of
whether or not such Losses relate to any third party claims), directly or
indirectly, resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any of the
following:

 



-69- 

    

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the date of this Agreement or as of
the Effective Time, a representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or the Officers Certificate, without giving effect to (A) any
qualifications based on the word "material" or similar phrases (including
"Company Material Adverse Effect") limiting the scope of such representation
or warranty ( _provided_ that the operation of this clause (A) shall not be
deemed to render references to "Company Material Adverse Effect" to "Effect"
or references to "Material Contract" to "Contract" and shall not apply to (x)
the third-to-last sentence of  _Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_ or (y) clause (i) of
the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.7(c)_, or (B) any update of or
modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on
or after the date of this Agreement (except solely with respect to, and as
required by, the second to last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a)_);

 

(ii) any third party Action against Buyer or any Subsidiary (including the
Company or any Subsidiaries) following the Closing, including the costs of
investigating, defending against and settling any such third party Action, if
an adverse judgment in connection with such third party Action would give the
Indemnified parties a rightful claim for indemnification under  _Section_ __
_ 9.2(a)(i)_;

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement;

(iv) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information, or breach of any representation
or warranty, set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet, Pre-Closing Statement or
Statement of Expenses (including any unpaid Third Party Expenses);

Subsidiaries (against the Company, Buyer, Sub or any of their Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) or any other Person) involving a right
or entitlement or an alleged right or entitlement to indemnification,
exculpation or reimbursement of expenses, in each case to the extent arising
under or allegedly arising under the Company Indemnification Provisions;

 

(viii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any fraud or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation on
the part of the Company or any Subsidiary, or by any Company Securityholder or
any Representative of any of the foregoing in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (solely with respect
to matters involving the Company or any Subsidiary (and not matters personal
to such Company Securityholder or Representative)); and

 

(ix) any of the matters described on _Schedule_ __ _ 9.2(a)_.

of doubt, "Losses" shall exclude punitive damages, unless and to the extent
such punitive damages are awarded by a Governmental Entity to a third party.

 



-70- 

    

(c) The Indemnifying Parties (including any officer or director of the
Company) shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right
of advancement from the Surviving Corporation or Buyer with respect to any
Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party payable by any of them in their capacity
as an Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ will be treated as adjustments to
the Total Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any
other remedy based on any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. No Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any
representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such
Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement hereunder.

9.3  _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Except in the case of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Fundamental
Representations, IP Representations or Tax Representations, the Indemnified
Parties may not recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification claim under
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the amount of the indemnifiable
Losses thereunder exceeds $25,000 with respect to such individual claim or
series of related claims, (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), in which case the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all Losses, including the
Per Claim Threshold, paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified
Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ shall not apply to indemnification claims under
clauses _(ii)_  _(ix)_ of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, inclusive.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_, the Indemnifying Parties aggregate
liability for indemnification obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_
shall not exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Indemnified Parties
sole and exclusive source of recovery for such claims under _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)_ shall be recourse against the cash held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund;
_provided, however,_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be
permitted to recover any Negative Adjustment Amount from the Adjustment Escrow
Fund pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of, or the Indemnified
Parties remedies against, any Person who perpetrates, or who has actual
knowledge of, fraud in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



-71- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the indemnification rights set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IX_ and recourse
against the Indemnity Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Indemnified Parties from and after the Effective Time for
monetary damages in connection with the matters described in _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)_ (which means that the survival periods and liability limits set forth
in this _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall control notwithstanding any statutory or
common law provisions or principles to the contrary); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Indemnified Parties ability to
pursue (i) specific performance or injunctive relief or other non-monetary
equitable remedies (excluding the doctrine of equitable indemnification), (ii)
remedies under any Related Agreements (other than the certificates and
documents to be delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)(xiv)_) against the parties thereto, and (ii) remedies against any
Person who perpetrates, or who has actual knowledge of, fraud in relation to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) The Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover indemnifiable Losses
from the following sources and in the following order:

 

(i) first, from the amounts then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund; and

 

(ii) second, from and under the Indemnity Insurance Policy.

 

(f) To the extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover
indemnifiable Losses in respect of amounts which are indemnifiable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ by a particular Person who had received
amounts pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall first use reasonable best
efforts to recover such indemnifiable Losses from such Person prior to seeking
recourse against the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this _Article_ __ _
IX_.

(g) The amount of any Losses recoverable by any Indemnified Party under
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds
actually received by, and/or any indemnification or contribution payments
actually paid by any third party to, such Indemnified Party in respect of
such Losses in, each case net all costs of recovery, including without
limitation reasonably anticipated increases in insurance premiums; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall any Indemnified Party be required to
seek or obtain any such insurance proceeds or third party indemnification or
contribution. If an Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies or third party indemnification or contribution payments
subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Parties (including from the Indemnity Escrow Fund), then such Indemnified
Party will, without duplication, promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Parties
(including via replenishing the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if applicable) for any
payment made by such Indemnifying Parties up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party; provided, that the aggregate amount of reimbursement
payments to the Indemnifying Parties will not in any event exceed the
aggregate indemnification payment received by the Indemnified Party from the
Indemnifying Parties. For clarity, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_
will be deemed to prejudice the ability of any Indemnified Party to seek
recourse against the Indemnity Escrow Fund and/or Indemnity Insurance Policy
at any time according to the other terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ ,
but rather this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_ is intended solely to prevent
multiple recoveries by any Indemnified Party for the same Losses.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation for any
Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary (i) resulting from any action taken by
the Company after the Closing on the Closing Date outside of the
ordinary course of business, or (ii) the ability of Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to utilize any Tax asset or attribute
(e.g., net operating loss carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) in any Tax
period or portion thereof (including any Straddle Tax Period) beginning on or
after the Closing Date.

 



-72- 

    

(i) Any claim for indemnification under _Article_ __ _ IX_, and any offer to
compromise or settle such claim, must be made on a pro rata basis to all
Indemnifying Parties (based on their respective Pro Rata Portions).

 

(j) Any liability for indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach or other violation of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, certificate or
certification. In addition, if and solely to the extent that an amount of
Losses in connection with an indemnifiable matter was already taken into
account in connection with calculation of the Final Total Closing
Consideration, the same amount of such Losses may not be recovered under
this  _Article_ __ _ IX_.

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event will
any Indemnifying Party be liable for any other Indemnifying Partys breach of
such other Indemnifying Partys representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements contained in any Holdback Agreement, Joinder Agreement, Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements or other ancillary agreement
hereto to which such other Indemnifying Party is a party.

 

9.4 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified
Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by
them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this _Article_ __ _
IX_. Except as set forth below, the period during which claims for Losses to
be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow Fund may be made under this Agreement
shall commence at the Closing and terminate on the date that is one (1) year
after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ ").

 

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days after the end of the Escrow Period,
the remaining portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, less any amount of
actual Losses or Losses estimated in good faith, if possible, in respect of
any resolved claims that have yet to be satisfied or any unresolved and
pending claims specified in any Officers Certificate (" _Unresolved Claims_
") delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Securityholder Representative in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ on or prior to the end of the Escrow
Period (the " _Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Amount_ "), shall be
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective
then-unpaid Pro Rata Portion of the Remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund Amount and
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that there exist Unresolved Claims as of the expiration of
the Escrow Period, as soon as each such Unresolved Claims has been resolved,
the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days following the resolution or satisfaction of such Unresolved Claims,
deliver to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective then-
unpaid Pro Rata Portion of the Remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund Amount and the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if
any, that was retained for purposes of satisfying such claim that was not
needed to satisfy such claim (each, a " _Subsequent Indemnity Escrow Release
Amount_ ").

 



-73- 

    

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Remaining Indemnity Escrow
Fund Amount_ " shall mean an amount equal to the sum of the Initial Indemnity
Escrow Release Amount and all Subsequent Indemnity Escrow Release Amounts.

 

9.5 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, if an
Indemnified Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an
" _Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") to the Securityholder Representative (with
a copy to the Escrow Agent) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay,
incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying such Losses in
reasonable detail (to the extent available), the date (if available) that
each such Loss was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for
such anticipated liability, and, if applicable, the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Buyer may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to
reflect any change in circumstances following the date thereof provided that
the update relates to the underlying facts and circumstances described in the
initial Indemnification Claim Notice.

(b) If the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(or the Indemnifying Party in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the 30-day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by
delivery of a written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to the
applicable indemnification claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice_ "), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment
by the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or
the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification
Claim Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(c) In the event that the Securityholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
9.5(b)_ (or in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, if such Indemnifying Party shall object
to any claim or claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover
claims directly from such Indemnifying Party within 30 days after delivery of
such Indemnification Claim Notice), the Securityholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Securityholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying
Party) and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value
equal to the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, Buyer may file suit with respect to the matter in any court having
jurisdiction.

 _SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_

 

10.1 _Appointment and Authority_ _of Securityholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company
Shareholders, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed
to appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as its exclusive agent, proxy, and attorney-in-
fact (with full power of substitution), as the Securityholder Representative
for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties for all purposes in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the agreements ancillary
hereto, including (a) to give and receive notices and communications in
respect of all Relevant Matters, including claims under this Agreement, (b) to
authorize, consent or object to any claims hereunder and authorize payment to
any Indemnified Party from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in satisfaction of any
claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party, or from the Adjustment Escrow Fund,

such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to any Relevant Matter, including any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by any Indemnified Party hereunder
against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (d) consent or agree to any amendment
to this Agreement, (e) grant any extension or waiver under or in connection
with this Agreement, and (e) and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder
Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement or (ii) specifically
mandated, permitted, or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties except as expressly
provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Securityholder Representative to the Indemnifying Parties
in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit, or the Disclosure Schedule. All
actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement
shall be binding upon each Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Partys
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Indemnifying Party, and all defenses which may be available to any
Indemnifying Party to contest, negate, or disaffirm the action of the
Securityholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement are
waived. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to
time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed unless
holders representing an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of two-thirds (2/3) agree
to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Securityholder Representative may
be filled by the holders representing an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of
greater than one-half (1/2). The immunities and rights to indemnification
hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of the Securityholder
Representative or any member of the Advisory Group, and the Closing and/or
any termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be
required of the Securityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or
from the Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties. The powers, immunities, and rights to indemnification
granted to the Securityholder Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable and binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Indemnifying Party of the whole or any fraction of his, her, or its interest
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(b) The Securityholder Representative (x) shall receive a copy in electronic
format of the contents of the electronic dataroom in connection with the
Closing and (y) shall have reasonable access to information about the
Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the Companys former
officers and employees for to the extent reasonably necessary for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder; _provided_ that the
Securityholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or
about the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation,
to anyone (except to the Indemnifying Parties or the Securityholder
Representatives employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or
authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case, who agree to
treat such information confidentially); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, shall
be obligated to provide any such access or information if it determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that: (i) it is prohibited from doing so pursuant to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party; (ii) the access
or disclosure would violate applicable Law; (iii) the access or disclosure
would cause the loss of or jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney work
product or other privilege; (iv) the access or disclosure would result in the
disclosure of a trade secret or other highly confidential, competitive, or
sensitive information; or (v) access or disclosure to a requested Contract
would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate any rights under such Contract. The Securityholder
Representative shall enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement
prior to being provided access to such information if reasonably requested by
Buyer.

 

10.2 _Exculpation and Indemnification of Shareholder Representation_. Neither
the Securityholder Representative nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents or employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the " _Securityholder Representative Group_ ") shall be
liable to any Indemnifying Party for any act done or omitted hereunder
as Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith and without gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties on whose behalf the
Indemnity Escrow Amount was contributed to the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall
indemnify the Securityholder Representative Group and hold the Securityholder
Representative Group harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee,
cost, judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Securityholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Securityholder Representatives duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel or other
professionals retained by the Securityholder Representative and costs incurred
in connection with seeking recovery from insurers (" _Securityholder
Representative Expenses_ "). A decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Securityholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or
waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ or _Section_ __ _
11.6_, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent
and Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Buyer are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative. Certain Indemnifying Parties (the " _Advisory
Group_ ") have concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with the
Securityholder Representative (the " _Securityholder Representative Engagement
Agreement_ ") regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to the
Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement. The Advisory Group
shall incur no liability to the Indemnifying Parties for any

 



-76- 

    

 liability incurred by the members of the Advisory Group while acting in good
faith and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of their duties (it being understood that any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith), even if such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part
of the Advisory Group or one of its members. The Indemnifying Parties agree
that the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Payment Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Indemnifying Party or other
party. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement.

 

10.3 _Expense Cash_.

(a) The Expense Cash shall be deposited with the Securityholder
Representative, to constitute an expense fund (the " _Expense Fund_ ") and to
be governed by the provisions set forth herein. The Expense Cash shall be
available to reimburse the Securityholder Representative for any
Securityholder Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the
Securityholder Representative, or to satisfy any claims against the
Indemnifying Parties hereunder if the Securityholder Representative shall
determine there are sufficient funds for such purpose, and shall be released
to the Indemnifying Parties and the Securityholder Representative, as the case
may be, pursuant to the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_. As soon as
reasonably determined by the Securityholder Representative that the Expense
Cash is no longer required to be withheld, the Securityholder Representative
shall deposit the remaining balance of the Expense Cash (if any) (the "
_Remaining Expense Fund Amount_ ") with the Payment Agent for further
distribution to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Portion of the Remaining Expense Fund Amount;  _provided_ , _that_ ,
if there are any pending but unresolved indemnification claims of any
Indemnified Parties, then all amounts shall remain in escrow and remain
available for release to the Securityholder Representative until
all indemnification claims have been finally resolved and the Securityholder
Representative has been reimbursed in full for all Securityholder
Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred and thereafter any
remaining Expense Cash shall be released to the respective Indemnifying
Parties (by the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as applicable) in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions. In the event such
Securityholder Representative Expenses exceed the remaining amount in the
Expense Fund, the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to recover
such Securityholder Representative Expenses: (i) following the expiration of
each Escrow Period from the Indemnity Escrow Amounts otherwise
distributable to or for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties only at the
time of distribution of such amounts (and not distributed or distributable to
an Indemnified Party or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an
Indemnified Party) pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement,
and such recovery will be made from the Indemnifying Parties according to
their respective Pro Rata Portions, or (ii) directly from the Indemnifying
Parties according to their Pro Rata Portions. The Indemnifying Parties agree
that no provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall require the
Securityholder Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its
powers, rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. For clarity, no Indemnified Party shall have any liability with
respect to the Expense Cash, including with respect to the distribution,
investment, holding and disposition thereof.

(b) The Securityholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability to the Indemnifying Parties for any loss of principal of the Expense
Cash other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholder Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any
similar capacity in connection with the Expense Cash, and has no tax reporting
or income distribution obligations. The Indemnifying Parties will not receive
any interest on the Expense Cash and assign to the Securityholder
Representative any such interest. The Securityholder Representative may
contribute funds to the Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise
distributable to the Indemnifying Parties.

 



-77- 

    

(c) For income Tax purposes, the Expense Cash shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties on the Closing
Date, and any Tax withholding required with respect to a Indemnifying Partys
deemed receipt of its Pro Rata Portion of the Expense Cash on the Closing Date
shall be satisfied from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement to such Indemnifying Party, consistent with _Section_ __ _
2.5_.

11.3 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_
or any information obtained pursuant to the notice requirements of _Section_
__ _ 7.13_, or otherwise pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
be governed by the terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated
December 19, 2018 (the " _Confidential Disclosure Agreement_ "), between
the Company and Buyer.

11.4 _Public Disclosure_. Neither the Company nor any of its Representatives
shall issue any statement or communication to any third party (other than its
agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions and other than to a
Governmental Entity to the extent required in the making of any filing or
notification required in connection with the transactions described herein or
to respond to any request for information or documents made by a Governmental
Entity investigating the transactions described herein) regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including,
if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor,
without the consent of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that in the event
that any party hereto alleges a breach of this Agreement, the Company and its
Representatives may make disclosures as needed to prosecute or defend against
such allegations to persons involved in dispute resolution proceedings (e.g.,
courts, attorneys, witnesses).

 

11.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sought.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, the Company Securityholders are
deemed to have agreed that any amendment, modification, alteration, or
supplement of this Agreement signed by the Securityholder Representative shall

not they have signed such any amendment, modification, alteration,
or supplement.

 



-80- 

    

11.6 _Extension and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the
one hand, and before the Closing the Company and after the Closing the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of
the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, the Company
Securityholders are deemed to have agreed that any extension or waiver signed
by the Company (if prior to Closing) or the Securityholder Representative (if
after the Closing) shall be binding upon and effective against all Company
Securityholders whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver.

11.7  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise, except that Buyer may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Buyer remains ultimately
liable for all of Buyers obligations hereunder.

11.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

11.9 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_.

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Company
Securityholder or the Securityholder Representative of any covenant,
obligation or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party
shall be entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to
any other remedy that may be available to it), to a decree or order of
specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant, obligation or other agreement and an injunction preventing or
restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall
be required to provide or post any bond or other security or collateral in
connection with any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any
related action or legal proceeding.

 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. However, following the Closing, _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_ shall control
exclusively on the topic of monetary remedies against the Indemnifying
Parties.

(c) The liability of any Person under  _Article_ __ _ IX_ will be in
addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may
have at law or in equity based on such Persons fraudulent acts or omissions,
or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions
set forth in this Agreement,

 



-81- 

    

 including the provisions set forth in _Article_ __ _ IX_, shall be deemed a
waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which such party
may have at law or in equity based on such Persons fraudulent acts or
omissions or willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation, nor will any
such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery
sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation (ii) the time period during which a claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation may be brought or (iii) the recourse which any
such party may seek against such Person with respect to a claim for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by such Person.

11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims, causes of action
(whether in contract, tort or statute) or other matter that may result from,
arise out of, be in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, administration, performance, or enforcement of this Agreement,
including any claim or cause of action resulting from, arising out of, in
connection with, or relating to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement (the " _Relevant Matters_ "), shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles
of conflicts of laws thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that all matters
related to the approval of the Merger by the Company, its board of directors
and its shareholders and the effects of and consummation of the Merger shall
be governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

 

11.11 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or in connection with any Relevant Matter shall be instituted first
in, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue
of, the Court of Chancery within New Castle County in the State of Delaware
(and any appellate court thereof located within such county) and to
the extent such Court of Chancery (or appellate court thereof located within
such county) lacks jurisdiction over the matter, the federal courts of the
United States of America located within New Castle County in the State of
Delaware, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service of process,
summons, notice or other document by mail to such partys address set forth
herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or other
proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or any proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waive and agree not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY RELEVANT MATTER.

11.13 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such
as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow
Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a
legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The parties
each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves
as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

 



-82- 

    

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, _Annex_ __ _ A_ hereto, the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related
Agreements, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except that the Company Indemnified Parties are intended third party
beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ and the Indemnified Parties are
intended third party beneficiaries of  _Article_ __ _ IX_.

11.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

 

11.16 _Consent to Representation; Conflict of Interest_. If the Securityholder
Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the Company Securityholders
and without the need for any consent or waiver by Company, Buyer, or Merger
Sub, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian LLP ("
_Gunderson_ ") shall be permitted to represent the Company Securityholders
after the Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements
referenced herein or any disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson shall
be permitted to represent the Company Securityholders, any of their agents and
Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation,
transaction, or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration, or other
adversary proceeding) with Buyer, the Company, or any of their agents or
Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated
by this Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising
under other agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement,
including with respect to any indemnification claims.
