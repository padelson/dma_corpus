conditions of this Agreement and (ii) approved this Agreement.

of incorporation.



(b) The by-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be amended in their entirety at the Effective Time to

qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 ARTICLE II



_E FFECTS OF THE MERGER; CONSIDERATION_



 SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Company Securities_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Merger Sub, Buyer, the Stockholders, the Warrant Holders or the Option
Holders:



(a) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation;



(b) Each Share that is owned by (i) the Company as treasury stock, (ii)
Buyer, (iii) Merger Sub, (iv) any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer or
(v) any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto;



(c) Except as otherwise provided in clause (b) above and subject to Section
2.4, each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive $26.50 in cash, payable to
the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Common Stock Consideration_ ");



(d) Except as otherwise provided in clause (b) above and subject to Section
2.4, each share of Series F Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive a sum in cash equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the
Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended
through the date of this Agreement) plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, if
any, through the Effective Time, payable to the holder thereof, without
interest;



(e) Each Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become exercisable (by way of a cashless exercise) into the right
to receive a sum in cash equal to the Warrant Cancellation Payment, without
interest. Upon surrender of such Warrants in accordance with this Agreement,
such Warrants shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each former Warrant Holder shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing.
Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) shall be net of all
applicable withholding and excise taxes;



(f) Each Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall fully vest and become exercisable
(by way of a cashless exercise) into the right to receive a sum in cash equal
to the Option Cancellation Payment, without interest. Upon surrender of such
Options in accordance with this Agreement, such Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each former Option Holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, other than the right to receive the consideration set forth
herein. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Any  



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(f) shall be net of all applicable
withholding and excise taxes. As of the Effective Time, the Option Plan shall
terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall be cancelled;



(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Companys
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the _"ESPP"_ ) and on such date of termination
the Company shall use participants contributions under the ESPP to purchase
Common Stock and no further purchases will be made thereunder. In addition,
the Company shall amend the ESPP to provide that all shares held in a deposit
account under the ESPP shall be released from such restrictions on transfer
as contained in the ESPP, effective as of the Effective Time, such that such
shares shall have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions
(including the conditions set forth in Section 2.2) hereunder as each share
of Common Stock not subject to any restrictions as provided in this Section
2.1;



(h) The restrictions on each share of Restricted Stock shall lapse
immediately prior to, and effective upon the occurrence of, the Effective
Time, and each share of Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder
thereof at such time, and each such share of Restricted Stock will be treated
at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to
the same conditions (including the conditions set forth in Section 2.2)
hereunder as, each share of Common Stock not subject to any restrictions as
provided in Section 2.1; and



(i) After the Effective Time, all capital stock of the Company, and all
Options and Warrants relating thereto, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired, or converted in accordance with
this Section 2.1, as the case may be, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares, Options or Warrants shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, other than the right to receive the
consideration provided herein, subject to Section 2.4.



 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint the Paying Agent to
act as agent for the holders of Shares and Warrants in connection with the
Merger and to receive the funds to which such holders shall become entitled
pursuant to this Article II.



(b) At the Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but not
later than two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be mailed, or otherwise make available, to each holder of record of
Shares or Warrants entitled to receive consideration pursuant to Section 2.1
the form of the Letter of Transmittal. After the Effective Time, each holder
of certificates or other instruments formerly evidencing Shares or Warrants
(the  _"Certificates"_ ), upon surrender of such Certificates to the Paying
Agent, together with the completed Letter of Transmittal, shall be entitled to
receive from the Paying Agent, in exchange therefor, the aggregate
consideration for such Shares or Warrants, as the case may be, in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Certificates so surrendered shall be
cancelled. The Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or  



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Warrants, as the case may be, such amounts as the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying
Agent or Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Warrants,
as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or Buyer, as the case may
be. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2 (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares), each Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the aggregate consideration for such Shares or Warrants, as the case may be,
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.



(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Shares or Warrants, as
the case may be, that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company,
subject to any applicable deductions or withholdings as described in Section
2.2(b) above, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Certificate shall be lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an undertaking of
indemnity by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(d) At any time following the expiration of six (6) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, in its sole discretion, be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and such funds shall thereafter become the property of the Surviving
Corporation. Such funds may be commingled with the general funds of the
Surviving Corporation and shall be free and clear of any claims or interests
of any Person. Thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable consideration payable as contemplated by this Agreement (net of
any amounts that would be subject to withholding) upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Any portion of such remaining cash
unclaimed by holders of Shares or Warrants, as the case may be, as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.



(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfer in the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares, Warrants or
Options, as the case may be, that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.



 

5 ##### Table of Contents

  

(f) At the Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but not
later than two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall, in
exchange for the Options that became entitled to receive the consideration
specified in Section 2.1, make the Option Cancellation Payment in respect of
each such Option to each Option Holder. The Surviving Corporation and Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Option Holder such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable Tax
Law or with respect to the making of other payments hereunder in connection
with other equity interests in the Company held by such Option
Holder (provided that such amounts have not been previously deducted and
withheld). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Option Holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Buyer, as the case may be.



 SECTION 2.3 _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, Buyer will make (or
cause to be made) payment to (i) the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Company in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
in an amount equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate Common Stock Consideration
and (y) the aggregate Warrant Cancellation Payments, and (ii) the Surviving
Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by Company in writing no later than two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the aggregate
Option Cancellation Payments, in each case to the extent payable as provided
in Section 2.1.



 SECTION 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares
of the Companys capital stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders who shall not have voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the _"Dissenting Shares_ _"_ ) shall
not be converted into or represent the right to receive the consideration set
forth in Section 2.1. Such holders shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Shares held by holders who shall have failed to perfect or
who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the consideration specified in Section 2.1 (as
adjusted, if applicable), without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in
the manner provided in Section 2.2, of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares.



(b) The Company shall give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The  



 

6 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Buyer, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.



 ARTICLE III



_R EPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_



Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as
follows:



 SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary because
of the property owned, leased or operated by it or because of the nature of
its business as now being conducted, except for any failure to so qualify or
be in good standing which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1
of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company prior to, or concurrently
with, the execution of this Agreement (the _"Disclosure Schedule"_ or the
_"Schedules"_ ) lists the jurisdictions of incorporation and foreign
qualifications of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the constitutive
documents of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and has made available to Buyer each such
entitys minute books and stock records. Section 3.1 of the Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and correct list of the directors and officers of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement.



 SECTION 3.2 _Authority; Approvals_.



(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within its corporate powers and have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (other than the adoption
of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholders, and the filing of a
Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer and Merger Sub) constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
by the application of general principles of equity.



(b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the _"Company Board"_ ) has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) resolved that
the Merger is fair to, and in the bests interests of, the Company and its
stockholders and declared this Agreement and the Merger to be advisable, (iii)
resolved to approve this Agreement and (iv) resolved to recommend that the  



 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof,
none of the aforesaid actions by the Board of Directors of the Company has
been amended, rescinded or modified.

(a) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Buyer
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present  



 

28 ##### Table of Contents

  

 directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company (" _Covered
Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Companys amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, as amended, second amended and restated bylaws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any Covered Persons for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer agrees to,
and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such
persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Covered Person
shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters
subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent provided in the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, _provided_  that
any person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by
the DGCL, to repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made
against any Covered Person with respect to matters subject to indemnification
hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.



(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons
then are currently set forth in the Companys amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, as amended, and second amended and restated by-laws. Any
indemnification agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of
this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without any further action, and shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.



(c) For six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide to the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring on or
before the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than
the Companys existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 5.8(c) more than an amount per year equal to 250% of
current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $462,500 in the aggregate)
but, in such case, shall purchase as much coverage as is reasonably practical
for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained (whether
purchased by Buyer or the Company, _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company expend more than $1.1 million in the aggregate to obtain such
policies) prior to or as of the Effective Time for purposes of this Section
5.8(c), which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage no
less favorable than the Companys existing policy for an aggregate period of
at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  



 

29 ##### Table of Contents

  

 hereby. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.



(d) The obligations under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee to whom this
Section 5.8 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being
expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 apply and their
respective heirs, successors and assigns shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.8). In the event Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.8.



 SECTION 5.9 _Expenses_. Except for expenses arising out of the filing of
a premerger notification and report form under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger (which such expenses shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Company)
and as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(b), each party hereto shall bear its
own fees, costs and expenses incurred in the pursuit of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and expenses of its
respective counsel, financial advisors and accountants.



 SECTION 5.10 _Continuity of Employees and Employee Benefits_.



(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall provide employees of the Surviving Corporation
who were employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") with annual rates of base
salary or hourly wages, as applicable, annual incentive opportunities and
coverage and benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements that are, in the aggregate, not materially less favorable
than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees under
the Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Where applicable, each
Company Employee shall receive full credit for service with the Company and
its ERISA Affiliates (including predecessor companies) for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual under each
employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement to be provided by Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation to such Company Employees to the same extent such
service was recognized under the applicable Plan immediately prior to the
Closing, except where such crediting would result in duplicate benefits;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such credit need be given with respect to new
equity incentive programs established by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, will, and Buyer will cause the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, honor, in accordance with their
terms, all individual employment, severance and change of control agreements
between the Company and any Company Employee including, without limitation,
bonuses, incentives or deferred compensation in existence on the date hereof
and disclosed to Buyer. Buyer acknowledges that consummation of the Merger
shall constitute a "Change of Control" as defined in such agreements.

Corporation, as applicable, will, and Buyer will cause the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company Benefit Plans to, provide or pay when due
to the Company Employees all benefits and compensation pursuant to any Plans,
programs or arrangements in effect on the date hereof earned or accrued
through, and to which such individuals are entitled as of, the Effective Time
(or such later time as such Plans as in effect at the Effective Time are
terminated or canceled by the Surviving Corporation subject to compliance
with this Section 5.10).



(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the continued employment of any
person, and, except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.10, no provision
of this Agreement shall prevent Buyer or Surviving Corporation from amending
or terminating any Plan.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as
may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Stock) that are treated as dispositions
under such rule and result from the Merger or other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company.



 SECTION 5.11 _Supplemental Information_. Prior to Closing, the Company
will inform Buyer and Merger Sub promptly upon becoming aware of any facts,
matters or circumstances arising after the date hereof which, individually or
in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or that would otherwise cause any condition to the
obligations of Buyer or Merger to effect the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied.



 SECTION 5.12 _Tax Matters_.



(a) Buyer shall be liable for all Transfer Taxes arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. " _Transfer Taxes_ " means all
sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, recording or similar Taxes, together with any
interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees or additions to tax. The

the Code.
