_Working Capital Adjustment_ ");

 



 

(ii) increased by the shortfall or decreased by the excess, as the case

(iv) increased by the excess or decreased by the shortfall, as the case
may be, of the Estimated Unpaid Transaction Expenses as compared to the Unpaid

amount, the " _Transaction Expenses Adjustment_ "); and

 



 

(v) increased by the shortfall or decreased by the excess, as the case may
be, of the Estimated Change of Control Payments as compared to the Change of
Control Payments, calculated in accordance with _Section _ _2.03_ (such
amount, the " _Change of Control Payments Adjustment_ ").

 



 

(b) The final amount of the consideration payable to the Sellers (the "
_Final Purchase Price_ ") shall be equal to the Provisional Purchase Price

Cash Balances Adjustment, the Indebtedness Adjustment, the Transaction
Expenses Adjustment and the Change of Control Payments Adjustment, as finally
determined pursuant to _Section _ _2.03_.

 



 

2.03 _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and provide to the Sellers'
Representative its good faith calculation of the Closing Accounts and a
written statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth: (i) the
calculation of the amount of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash
Balances and the Closing Indebtedness as resulting from the Closing Accounts,
as well as the calculation of the Change of Control Payments and the Unpaid
Transaction Expenses; (ii) the resulting adjustment to the Provisional
Purchase Price, if any; (iii) the resulting adjustment to the Aggregate
Preferred Share Consideration and the Aggregate Ordinary Share Consideration,
if any; and (iv) the Final Purchase Price. The Closing Accounts and the
Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in good faith and in accordance with
the Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, in connection with and until the
final determination of the Adjustment Statement pursuant to this _Section _
_2.03_ , the Purchaser and the Sellers shall, and shall ensure that their
Affiliates and representatives shall, provide all reasonable cooperation to
the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser and their representatives, as
applicable, for purposes of reviewing the Closing Accounts, the Adjustment
Statement and any Notice of Objection (subject to reasonable confidentiality
restrictions and other agreements customarily required in such circumstances),
including granting reasonable access to all applicable documents, books,
Records, data, working papers, files, other information under its control
reasonably related thereto, and to any of its staff, upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours; _provided_ that such access shall be
in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of the
Group Companies, the Purchaser or the Sellers.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) The Sellers' Representative shall have a period of forty-five (45)
calendar days from the date of receipt of the Closing Accounts and the
Adjustment Statement (the " _Examination Period_ ") to provide written notice
to the Purchaser of any objections to the Adjustment Statement, including any
objections the Sellers' Representative has to the Closing Accounts with
respect to the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash Balances and the
Closing Indebtedness or to the calculation of the Change of Control Payments
and the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the " _Notice of Objection_ "). If the
Sellers' Representative does not send a Notice of Objection to the Purchaser
during the Examination Period, the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to
have irrevocably accepted all of the terms of the Adjustment Statement, which
shall then become final and binding on the Parties.

 



 

(d) The Notice of Objection, if any, shall specifically mention each of
the corrections the Sellers' Representative believes should be made to the
Adjustment Statement, and shall specify the reasons therefor in reasonable
detail and provide reasonable supporting detail with respect to any
calculation of the Unpaid Transaction Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Cash Balances, the Change of Control Payments and the Closing Working
Capital set forth therein. All items of the Adjustment Statement not objected
to by the Sellers' Representative in the Notice of Objection in the manner
specified above shall be deemed to have been irrevocably accepted by the
Sellers' Representative on behalf of all of the Sellers and shall be final and
binding on the Parties and the Independent Auditor (as defined below).

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section _ _2.03(f)_ , if a Notice of Objection is sent to
the Purchaser, the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall in good
faith attempt to reach an agreement on the amounts and components of the
Adjustment Statement objected to by the Sellers' Representative.

 



 

(f) If the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative are unable to resolve
their differences on the matters specified in the Notice of Objection within
thirty (30) calendar days after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the
Notice of Objection, then the remaining disputed matters shall, at the request
of either the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, be submitted to an
internationally recognized firm of independent auditors that is mutually
agreed to by the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (the " _Independent
Auditor_ "). The Independent Auditor shall be Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by the
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(g) The Independent Auditor shall perform such procedures as it considers
appropriate to form an independent opinion on the amounts and components of
the Adjustment Statement that were not agreed upon between the Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative (the " _Disputed Amounts_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that: (i) the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Independent Auditor shall be limited to whether there were mathematical errors
in the Adjustment Statement or whether the Adjustment Statement was prepared
in accordance with the Accounting Principles (and the provisions of this
_Section_ _2.03_ and its related definitions) with respect to the matters
submitted for resolution to the Independent Auditor; (ii) only those matters
specifically raised in the Notice of Objection shall be opined upon by the
Independent Auditor; and (iii) with respect to each matter that is
quantifiable, the amount finally determined by the Independent Auditor shall
not be higher than the highest nor lower than the lowest of the amounts
respectively put forward by the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser. Any
disputes not within the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Independent
Auditor pursuant to this _Section _ _2.03(g)_ as well as any dispute about
the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Independent Auditor pursuant to
this _Section _ _2.03(g)_ shall be resolved in accordance with _Section _
_12.16_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(h) The Sellers' Representative shall provide the Independent Auditor with
a briefing paper as to the Disputed Amounts and shall simultaneously provide a
copy of such briefing paper to the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have the
opportunity to provide a response to the Independent Auditor within fifteen
(15) Business Days of receiving the Sellers' Representative's briefing paper,
which response shall also be simultaneously provided to the Sellers'
Representative. To the extent that either the Purchaser or the Sellers'
Representative so requests in its respective briefing paper, the Independent
Auditor shall give the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative the
opportunity to present their arguments orally at a joint hearing. Unless
expressly requested by the Independent Auditor, no further information shall
be provided by the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative to the Independent
Auditor regarding such Disputed Amounts. The Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Independent Auditor to issue a reasoned report setting forth the final
determination of the subject of the dispute within thirty (30) Business Days
from the date of its appointment.

 



 

(i) The Independent Auditor's final determination as to all disputed items
in accordance with this _Section_ _2.03_ shall be a final binding third-party
decision, except in the case of fraud or manifest error by any Party to this
Agreement. The dispute resolution by the Independent Auditor under this
_Section_ _2.03_ shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR
Article 76 and shall not constitute an arbitration.

 



 

(j) The cost of any dispute resolution (including the fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditor and reasonable documented attorney fees and expenses
of the Parties) pursuant to this _Section _ _2.03_ shall be borne by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Auditor,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Independent
Auditor at the time the determination of the Independent Auditor is rendered
on the merits of the matters submitted.

 



 

2.04 _Seller 's Pro Rata Share_. A calculation of each Seller's Pro Rata
Share has been included in _Exhibit C_. For the avoidance of doubt, all
Sellers hereto irrevocably and unconditionally acknowledge that _Exhibit C_
is true and correct as of the date hereof. Promptly after the finalization of
the Adjustment Statement in accordance with _Section _ _2.03_ , the Sellers'
Representative shall update _Exhibit C_.

Provisional Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price from the Escrow Fund
and to transfer to the Payments Administrator for further distribution to the
Sellers any remaining balance. If the Final Purchase Price is lower than the

Plan, (ii) plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, (iii) "multiple employer
plan" for purposes of Section 4063, 4064 or 4066 of ERISA, (iv) "multiple

Group Companies other than health continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA
and/or compliance with minimum coverage provided by applicable Laws, and no
circumstances exist that could result in any of the Group Companies becoming
obligated to provide any such benefits.

 



 

(c) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been maintained and
administered, and each Group Company is with respect thereto, in compliance in
all material respects with its terms and the applicable requirements of ERISA,
the Code, the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the French Labor and Social
Security Codes and any other applicable Laws. All required contributions,

or accrued as a current liability. Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code or

(e) None of the Group Companies or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
Participant, trustee or fiduciary of any Company Employee Benefit Plan (or any
related trust) has engaged in any transaction with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject the Group
Companies to any material Tax or penalty (civil or otherwise) imposed by
ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) Except as provided in the Employment Agreements, neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will cause (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount
or value of, any payment or benefit to any current of former employee,
officer, director or contractor of the Group Companies (each, a "
_Participant_ "), or result in any breach or violation of or default under, or
limit the Group Companies' right to amend, modify or terminate, any Company
Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone
or in combination with any other event) will not give rise to any payment (or
acceleration of vesting of any amounts or benefits) that will be an "excess
parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Code. No Participant is
entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of any Tax
being imposed on such Person, including any Tax required by Section 409A or
4999 of the Code. The Company has obtained any required waivers or consents
from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) with respect to any Group Company (a " _Disqualified Individual_ "), and
on March 10, 2017, submitted for approval or disapproval, by the Sellers of
the Company, in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the
final Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, the right of each Disqualified
Individual to receive or retain, as applicable, the payments and benefits
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) described in the
Seller disclosure memorandum provided to, reviewed and approved by the
Purchaser and its representative prior to such date.

 



 

(h) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan maintained outside the jurisdiction
of the United States primarily for the benefit of any Participant residing or
working outside the United States, which is required to be registered or

to the knowledge of the Company, has been maintained in good standing with
applicable requirements of Governmental Entities.

in each case that are in effect as of the date hereof. The Group Companies are
insured against such risks and in such amounts as required by applicable Law
or as the Company has reasonably determined to be necessary and prudent in
light of the business of the Group Companies. No written notice of
cancellation or nonrenewal with respect to or material increase in any premium
of any such insurance policy has been received by the Group Companies. All of
the insurance policies of the Group Companies are in full force and effect,
and no Group Company is in default with respect to its obligations under any
of such insurance policies or has been denied insurance coverage. There are no
claims by the Group Companies pending under any such policies or bonds as to

Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, provide the Sellers'
Representative and its authorized representatives with access (for the purpose

periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date, including with respect
to any insurance claims, governmental investigations, legal compliance and
financial statement preparation, but excluding any Tax Returns; _provided_

Representative such books and records or any portion thereof that the
Purchaser or the Company may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of;
_provided_ that, if the Sellers' Representative shall not promptly respond to
such notice, the Purchaser shall be entitled to dispose of such books and
records at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding to the contrary in the first
or second sentence of this _Section _ _7.01_ , the Purchaser shall not be
required to provide access to any books and records to the extent such access

7.02 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter
through August 31, 2017 (or, if shorter, the period of employment with the

the Group Companies who is employed primarily in the U.S. and continues to be
employed by the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date

substantially comparable to the salary or hourly wage rate and target annual
cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such U.S. Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits
(other than defined benefit pension and retiree medical benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided
under the Company Employee Benefit Plans in which such U.S. Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser further agrees that the Purchaser will, and will cause
the Group Companies to, grant all U.S. Continuing Employees full credit for
all service with the Group Companies (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Group Companies provide such past service credit) prior to the Closing
Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determining the level of
vacation and severance benefits under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy or agreement made available to U.S. Continuing Employees on or
after the Closing Date occurs (collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Closing Date by
the Group Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits. In addition, the Purchaser will, and will cause the Group
Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cause to be waived
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods, and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans that provide health benefits in which U.S.
Continuing Employees commence participation during the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs to the extent such exclusions, requirements, or
limitations were waived or satisfied by a U.S. Continuing Employee under any
Company Employee Benefit Plan providing health benefits in which the U.S.
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
cause any deductible, co-insurance, and out-of-pocket expenses paid by any
U.S. Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) prior to the Closing
Date under a Company Employee Benefit Plan that provides health benefits
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be taken into account
for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance, and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions under any New Plan that provides health
benefits for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(c) Following the Closing Date, each U.S. Continuing Employee's and each
Non-U.S. Continuing Employee's eligibility for vacation and other paid time
off shall be determined under the Purchaser's vacation policy, other than with
respect to amounts of accrued but unused vacation prior to the Closing Date,
which shall be honored solely to the extent that such amounts are reflected as
a Liability in the Company's calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing
Date.

 



 

(d) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries will
provide each employee of the Group Companies who is not a U.S. Continuing

following the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Non-U.S. Continuing_
___Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits in compliance with applicable
Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section _ _7.02_ , (i) is intended to
confer upon any U.S. Continuing Employee or Non-U.S. Continuing Employee or
any other Person any right to continued employment or any particular term or
condition of employment for any period, (ii) will prohibit or limit the
ability of the Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates

an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or Company Employee
Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract,
agreement or arrangement. Further, this _Section _ _7.02_ will be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement,
and nothing in this _Section _ _7.02_ , express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
(including any third-party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this
_Section _ _7.02_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

7.03 _Purchaser 's Release_. Effective as of the Closing, except as

manner of actions, causes of actions, claims, obligations, demands, damages,

ARTICLE VIII _ 

TAX MATTERS_

 



 

8.01 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers' Representative shall prepare (or cause to be prepared)
all Tax Returns (other than those relating to Transfer Taxes, which are
addressed by _Section _ _10.04_ ) that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Group Companies for any taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date (each, a " _Seller Prepared Return_ "). The Purchaser
will (and will cause the Company to) cooperate with the Sellers'
Representative to enable the Sellers' Representative to utilize the Company's
existing tax return preparation firm(s) (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Such
cooperation may include providing access to books and records and accounting
staff, and delegating authority to the Sellers' Representative under the
Accounting Firm's engagement agreement sufficient for the Accounting Firm to
take direction from the Sellers' Representative, or otherwise ensuring that
the Sellers' Representative will have access to (and the ability to direct,
even if indirectly through the Company) the Accounting Firm. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company will be responsible for filing the Tax Returns. All
Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared consistent with the past practice of
the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or agreed by the
parties in writing.

 



 

(i) The Company shall timely file or cause to be filed all Seller Prepared
Returns that are required to be filed (giving effect to any validly obtained
extensions) on or before the Closing Date.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(ii) In the case of any Seller Prepared Return that is required to be
filed (giving effect to any validly obtained extensions) after the Closing
Date, Sellers' Representative shall deliver a draft of such Seller Prepared
Return and related work papers to the Purchaser for its review and comment at
least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the respective due date of such
Seller Prepared Return. The Sellers' Representative shall consider and
incorporate in good faith into such Seller Prepared Return any changes
reasonably requested by the Purchaser with respect to such Seller Prepared
Return and the Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed such Seller
Prepared Return; _provided_ that, if Purchaser believes in good faith that
filing any such Seller Prepared Return would reasonably be expected to result
in the imposition of criminal penalties on the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, the Purchaser shall be entitled to make such changes as the
Purchaser reasonably believes are necessary to avoid such penalties.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser will prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared
and timely filed) all Tax Returns (other than those relating to Transfer
Taxes, which are addressed by _Section _ _10.04_ ) of the of the Group
Companies for all Straddle Periods; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with
respect to each such Tax Return, to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with prior
practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or agreed by the parties
in writing. The Purchaser shall provide a draft of any such Tax Return and
related work papers to the Sellers' Representative for its review and comment
at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the respective due date of such
Tax Returns. The Purchaser shall consider and incorporate in good faith into
such Tax Returns any changes reasonably requested by the Sellers'
Representative with respect to such Tax Returns insofar as they relate to
Taxes for which the Sellers have the obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
pursuant to _Section_ ___10.04_ and the Purchaser shall timely file (or cause
to be timely filed) such Tax Return with the relevant Tax Authority as so
adjusted.

 



 

(c) All Taxes due and payable with respect to Tax Returns described in
this _Section _ _8.01_ shall be paid or caused to be paid by preparer to the
relevant Tax Authority, subject to reimbursement by the other party pursuant
to _ARTICLE _ _IX_.

 



 

8.02 _Allocation of Tax Liability for Straddle Periods_. For purposes of
allocating responsibility for Taxes between the Sellers and the Purchaser for
a Straddle Period, Taxes shall be attributed to the pre-closing portion of a
Straddle Period as follows: (a) in the case of any Tax that is either based
upon or measured by income or gross receipts or imposed in connection with any
sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible), including any sales or use Tax and any withholding Tax, the
amount of Taxes attributable to the pre-closing portion of the Straddle Period
shall be equal to (i) the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax
period ended on and included the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of any such
Taxes attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in a partnership,
other "flow through" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code or any comparable applicable Law), as if
the taxable period of that entity ended on and included the Closing Date, and
(b) in the case of any Taxes not described in clause (a) above that are
imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item (e.g.,
property Taxes that are based upon valuation of the item), the amount of such
Taxes attributable to the pre-closing portion of the Straddle Period shall be
the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
and including the day prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 



 



 

 



   



 

8.03 _Amendment of Tax Returns; Other Tax Actions_. Without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not allow the Group Companies to, (a) re-file, amend or otherwise modify
(in whole or in part) any Seller Prepared Return after the date such Tax
Returns are filed, unless required by applicable Law, (b) extend or waive, or
cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period for
the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(c) except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to the

that is outside the ordinary course of business.

 



 

8.04 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Purchaser or
the Group Companies, and any amounts credited against Tax in lieu of a Tax
refund to which the Purchaser or the Company becomes entitled, that relate to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be for the account of the Sellers, except to the
extent any such Tax refund or credit against Tax in lieu of a Tax refund was
included as a Current Asset in the determination of Working Capital, as
ultimately determined pursuant to _Section_ _2.03_. Any Tax refunds that are
received by any of the Sellers, and any amounts credited against Tax in lieu
of a Tax refund to which any of the Sellers become entitled, that relate to a
Tax period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
the Purchasers. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall pay over, or cause to be
paid over, to the Purchaser or the Sellers, respectively, any such refund or
the amount of any such credit to which the Purchaser or the Seller,
respectively, is entitled under this _Section _ _8.04_ within ten (10) days
after receipt thereof, in the case of a Tax refund, or after filing the Tax
Return pursuant to which the credit is claimed, in the case of any credit
against Tax in lieu of a Tax refund. If any portion of a refund or credit is
subsequently disallowed by any Tax Authority, then amounts previously paid
hereunder in respect thereof shall be promptly reimbursed by the payee to the
payor. The Purchaser shall file for refunds of refundable French research tax
credits which relate to eligible research expenditures incurred on or before
December 31, 2016. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any French research credit
refunds shall be retained by the Purchaser.

 



 

8.05 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, the Company, and the
Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and the claiming
of Tax refunds pursuant to this _ARTICLE _ _VIII_ and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and the making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers agree
(i) to retain all financial books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Group Companies relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or the Sellers, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such financial books and records and, if the other party so
requests, the Company or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such financial books and records.

make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any and all
of the Group Companies that are not incorporated in the United States.

limitations contained in _ARTICLE IX_ , the Sellers shall be responsible for
and shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all Taxes for any

(iii) any Unpaid Transaction Expenses to the extent not reflected in the

remedies it may have under any applicable Law (it being understood that
nothing in this _Section _ _9.06_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect
the Parties' rights to specific performance or other equitable remedies to

the Company or the Sellers in this Agreement) to the extent that provision for
the matter or Damages that would otherwise give rise to the claim in question
has been provided in the Closing Accounts, unless the Damages are greater than
the amount that has been provisioned, in which case the Purchaser shall be
entitled to make a claim for the excess of such Damages above the amount
provisioned for in the Closing Accounts.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification under _Section _
_9.02(a)_ shall be calculated net of any Tax benefits actually received in
cash (or as a reduction in cash Taxes otherwise owing) in the Tax year the
indemnity payment is received by the Indemnified Party and any insurance
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party (including any proceeds
received pursuant to the RWI Policy) or any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment which has been recovered by the Indemnified Parties from any
third party with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not have the right to
indemnification under this Agreement for any Damages to the extent such
Damages are based on Taxes: (i) attributable to taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) resulting from transactions or
actions taken by the Purchaser, the Group Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing that are outside the ordinary course of business,
or (iii) that result from Purchaser's breach of any of the covenants contained
in _ARTICLE _ _VIII_.

 



 

(d) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
under _Section_ _9.02(a)(i)_ or _Section_ _9.02(b)_ , prior to seeking
recovery from any Seller, Purchaser agrees to make, or cause the appropriate
Purchaser Indemnified Party to make, a claim for the full amount of such
Damages under the RWI Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that, so long as the
Purchaser or the appropriate Purchaser Indemnified Party has first made such a
claim under the RWI Policy, the Purchaser or such Purchaser Indemnified Party
may also make a claim for indemnification under _Section_ _9.02(a)(i)_ or
_Section_ _9.02(b)_ , notwithstanding the fact that the Purchaser Indemnified
Party's claim under the RWI Policy is still pending. Purchaser also agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, and cause the appropriate
Purchaser Indemnified Party to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue, such claim under the RWI Policy. Purchaser agrees not to, and shall
cause the Company not to, cancel or otherwise consent to the termination of
the RWI Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event shall any
Purchaser Indemnified Party be entitled to recover any duplicate Damages
pursuant to this _ARTICLE _ _IX_ (for the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to recover Damages in respect
of a claim under both this _ARTICLE _ _IX_ and the RWI Policy, recovery under
this _ARTICLE _ _IX_ of any deductible in respect of such claim under the RWI
Policy shall not constitute duplicate Damages); and (ii) if any Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall recover any duplicate Damages pursuant to the RWI
Policy subsequent to recovering any such corresponding Damages from a Seller
pursuant to this _ARTICLE _ _IX_ , such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse and deliver the amount of the duplicate Damages recovered
pursuant to the RWI Policy to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the Sellers.

 



 

(e) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
under Section 9.02(a) severally against each of the Sellers, except in the
case of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of one or more of the Sellers,
such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall make, to the extent applicable, a
corresponding claim against each of the Sellers, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue such claim against each such Seller, unless the
Purchaser Indemnified Party has determined in good faith that pursuing such
claim against such Seller would not be commercially reasonable.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(f) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
under _Section_ _9.02(a)(iv)_ , prior to seeking recovery from any Seller,
Purchaser agrees that it shall, and shall cause the appropriate Purchaser
Indemnified Party, if applicable, to, prior to seeking indemnification from
Sellers, first, pursue recovery in respect of such Purchaser Indemnified
Party's claim(s) for Damages under the FinAnalytica Agreement from any amounts
(i) escrowed pursuant to Section 2.10 of the FinAnalytica Agreement (the "
_FinAnalytica Escrow Amount_ "); or (ii) recoverable by means of set-off,
pursuant to Section 2.15 and Section 7.5 of the FinAnalytica Agreement,
against any Earn-Out Amounts payable under the FinAnalytica Agreement.

 



 

(g) If the InvestPic Claim has not been finally determined in accordance
with Section 7.5(f) of the FinAnalytica Agreement (the " _Final Determination_
") on or prior to the date the Earn-Out Amount becomes payable pursuant to
Section 2.15 of the FinAnalytica Agreement, the Sellers' Representative,
solely on behalf of the Sellers, will transfer to the Purchaser an amount
equal to the Earn-Out Amount, if any (any such amount transferred to
Purchaser, the " _InvestPic Claim Reserve_ " and, the sum total of the
FinAnalytica Escrow Amount and the InvestPic Claim Reserve, the " _InvestPic
Claim Indemnity Amount_ ").

 



 

(h) Upon Final Determination of the InvestPic Claim, the InvestPic Claim
Reserve shall be dealt with as follows:

 



 

(i) In the event that the InvestPic Claim Damages are not greater than the
FinAnalytica Escrow Amount, the Purchaser shall transfer the full amount of
the InvestPic Claim Reserve to the Payments Administrator for further
distribution to the Sellers in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Share;

 



 

(ii) In the event that the InvestPic Claim Damages are greater than the
FinAnalytica Escrow Amount but less than the InvestPic Claim Indemnity Amount,
the Purchaser shall transfer the amount equal to the difference between the
InvestPic Claim Indemnity Amount and the InvestPic Claim Damages to the
Payments Administrator for further distribution to the Sellers in accordance
with each Seller's Pro Rata Share, and the Purchaser shall retain the balance
of the InvestPic Claim Reserve; or

 



 

(iii) In the event that the InvestPic Claim Damages are greater than the
InvestPic Claim Indemnity Amount, the Purchaser shall retain the entire
InvestPic Claim Reserve.

 



 

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate amount of InvestPic Claim
Damages for which Purchaser Indemnified Parties may make claims for
indemnification under _Section_ _9.02(a)(iv)_ hereunder shall be reduced on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by any amounts related to the InvestPic Claim that are
recovered pursuant to subsections (i) and (ii) of _Section_ _9.07(f)_ (or
retained by Purchaser from the InvestPic Claim Reserve pursuant to _Section_
___9.07(h)_ ), in each case by any Purchaser Indemnified Party.

 



 



 

 



   



 

9.08 _Procedure for Claims_.

 



 

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to: (i) the Sellers' Representative, in the
case of a claim against the Sellers; and (ii) the Purchaser, in the case of a
claim against the Purchaser; _provided_ that failure to so notify the
applicable Indemnifying Party shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from
any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this _ARTICLE _
_IX_ , except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, in each case where
the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party is, collectively, the Sellers,
then in each such case all references to such Indemnified Party or
Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, in this _Section _ _9.08_ shall be
deemed (except for provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to
receive any payments) to refer to the Sellers' Representative acting on behalf
of such Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as applicable.

 



 

(b) In the event of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
cause written notice of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim of which it has
knowledge that is covered by the indemnity set forth in this _ARTICLE _ _IX_
to be forwarded to: (i) the Sellers' Representative, in the case of a claim
against the Sellers; and (ii) the Purchaser, in the case of a claim against
the Purchaser (the recipient of such Third-Party Claim referred to as the "
_Third-Party Claim Indemnifying Party_ "). The failure of the Indemnified
Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third-Party Claim shall not
release, waive or otherwise affect the Third-Party Claim Indemnifying Party's
obligations with respect thereto, except to the extent that the Third-Party
Claim Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of
notice of such Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such
Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense and (ii)
subject to the terms of this _ARTICLE _ _IX_ , the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one (1) outside counsel of the
Indemnified Party in the event that the Third-Party Claim of which the
Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control involves a claim that outside legal
counsel to the Indemnified Party has advised the Indemnified Party is
inappropriate for joint representation because of an actual conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third-Party Claim. Such assumption of the conduct and control of the
settlement or defense shall not be deemed to be an admission or assumption of
liability by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense and control of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section _
_9.08(c)_ , the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. The
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, including by furnishing books and Records,
personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a
Third-Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement or
compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that such compromise, settlement or judgment does not
involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party, does not result in a liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation of or restriction on any
Indemnified Party, and provides to each Indemnified Party an unqualified
release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(d) Each Party hereto agrees to provide reasonable access to the other
Parties to such documents and information concerning the Group Companies as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party shall not, without prior approval (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld) of the Third-Party Claim Indemnifying Party,
settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment, unless the claimant or claimants and the Indemnified
Party provide to the Third-Party Claim Indemnifying Party an unqualified
release from all liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim.

the Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to seek such further
authorization or instruction from those Sellers appointed as "Advisors" under
that certain Engagement Letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the
Sellers' Representative, the Company and the Sellers. The appointment of the
Sellers' Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable

dissolution, disability, incapacity, or other inability to act of any
principal pursuant to any applicable Law. Shareholder Representative Services
LLC hereby accepts its appointment as the initial Sellers' Representative.

 



 

(c) _Actions by the Sellers ' Representative; Resignation; Vacancies_.
The Sellers' Representative may resign from its position as the Sellers'
Representative at any time by written notice delivered to the Purchaser and
the Sellers. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of the Sellers'
Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by the majority

For the avoidance of doubt, no resignation or vacancy by any Sellers'

(d) _No Liability_. All acts of the Sellers' Representative hereunder in
its capacity as such shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Sellers and
not of the Sellers' Representative individually. The Sellers' Representative
shall not have any liability for any amount owed to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement, including _Sections _ _2.05(a)(i)_ , _2.05(b)(ii)_ ,
_9.07(g)_ and _9.07(h)_. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable to
the Company, the Purchaser, or any other Person for any liability of a Seller
or otherwise or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement. The Sellers' Representative shall not be
liable to the Sellers for any liability of a Seller or otherwise, or for any
error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good
faith, or for any mistake in fact or Law, or for anything that it may do or
refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement, except in the case of
the Sellers' Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Sellers' Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel
and it shall incur no liability to the Sellers and shall be fully protected

(e) _Indemnification; Expenses_. The Sellers' Representative may use the
Sellers' Representative Amount to pay any fees, costs, expenses, or other
obligations incurred by the Sellers' Representative. The Sellers severally and
not jointly (in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Share) will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Sellers' Representative from and against any and
all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel
and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication
and shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Sellers' Representative's execution and performance of
this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that, in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Sellers'
Representative, the Sellers' Representative will reimburse the Sellers the
amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to
such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Sellers' Representative by the Sellers, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Sellers' Representative from (i) the Sellers' Representative
Amount and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining
amounts, if any, would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers; _provided_
that, while this section allows the Sellers' Representative to be paid from
the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Sellers from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Sellers' Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Sellers' Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Sellers or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability of the Sellers set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the

the Sellers' Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

engage in any transaction resulting in Aquiline's direct or indirect ownership
in (including by virtue of acquiring or owning, directly or indirectly, any
equity interest in), or affiliation with, StatPro Group plc or any of its

12.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by any Party hereto without the prior written consent of the non-
assigning Parties. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section _
_12.04_ shall be void.

 



 

12.05 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

12.06 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other
headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto
are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the

Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days (excluding Business
Days) or months shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All
references to "$" shall be deemed references to U.S. dollars and all

"Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule," or "Schedule" shall be deemed to
refer to a section of this Agreement, an exhibit to this Agreement, or a
schedule to this Agreement, as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein," and
"hereunder" and words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "including" or any variation thereof means "including,
without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any general statement
that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately
following it.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.07 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items,
are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or
outside of the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of
the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation
of Law or breach of contract). This Agreement is drawn up in the English
language. If this Agreement is translated into another language, the English
language text shall prevail.

 



 

12.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
(a) in the case of any amendment, by the Purchaser, the Company, and the
Sellers' Representative and (b) in the case of a waiver, by the Party or
Parties waiving rights hereunder. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any
breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

 



 

12.09 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, the other Transaction Documentation and that certain Engagement
Letter, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Sellers' Representative,
the Company and certain Sellers contain the complete agreement between the
Parties and supersede any prior understandings, agreements or representations
by or between the Parties, written or oral, which may have related to such
subject matter in any way, including any data room agreements, bid letters,
term sheets, summary issues lists or other agreements.

 



 

12.10 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Certain provisions of this Agreement
are intended for the benefit of the Sellers and shall be enforceable by the
Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers; _provided_ that no Seller
shall have the right to directly take any action or enforce any provision of
this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that all such actions shall be
taken solely by the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers as
provided in _Section _ _10.01_ hereof. In addition, (a) the Sellers'
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enforce any
rights of the Sellers after the Closing under this Agreement, (b) Aquiline
shall have the right to enforce its rights under _Section_ _12.01_ and
_Section_ _12.20_ , and (c) WFandG shall have the right to enforce its rights
under _Section _ _12.20_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement shall be construed to give
any Person, other than the Parties to this Agreement, any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.11 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND
THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER
OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



 

12.12 _Delivery to Representatives_. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that all documents or other items delivered or made available to such Parties'
authorized representatives shall be deemed to be delivered or made available,
as the case may be, to such Party for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

12.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party hereto or to any such
contract, each other Party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or
communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.
This Agreement is not binding, unless and until signature pages are executed
and delivered by each of the Company, the Purchaser, and the Sellers'
Representative.

 



 

12.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one
(1) Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

12.16 _Jurisdiction_. Any suit, Action, or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York; _provided_ that, if the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York does not have jurisdiction, any such suit,
Action, or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in any other court of the
State of New York, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, Action, or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, Action, or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, Action or proceeding which
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such suit, Action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in _Section _ _12.03_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.

 



 

12.17 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties agrees that this
Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that each of the Parties would be irreparably harmed
if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate
remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which a
non-breaching Party may be entitled at Law, a non-breaching Party shall be
entitled to injunctive relief without the posting of any bond or other
undertaking to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce
the terms and provisions hereof. Each Party further waives any defense that a
remedy at Law would be adequate in any action or proceeding for specific
performance or injunctive relief hereunder. The parties specifically consent
to the jurisdiction of the courts described in _Section _ _12.16_ for the
purpose of pursuing and administering such remedies.

 



 

12.18 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law, or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

12.19 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the Parties to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that this Agreement may
only be enforced against, and any Action, suit, or claim for breach of this
Agreement may only be made against, the Parties to this Agreement; _provided_
that the foregoing shall not in any way limit the Sellers' Representative's
rights of indemnification as provided in _Section_ _10.01(e)_.

 



 



 

 



   



 

12.20 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP (" _WF andG_") has acted as legal counsel to certain of the Sellers
(including Aquiline and its Affiliates) and the Company, its Affiliates, and
the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that WFandG intends to act as
legal counsel to certain of the Sellers (including Aquiline and its
Affiliates) after the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Company
(including on behalf of the Group Companies) hereby waives, on its own behalf
and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with WFandG representing any of the Sellers (including Aquiline and
its Affiliates) and/or its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation
may relate to the Purchaser, any Group Company, or the transactions
contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between any Sellers (including Aquiline and its Affiliates) and
its Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to such Sellers and their
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies or the Company). Accordingly, the
Group Companies and the Company shall not have access to any such
communications, or to the files of WFandG relating to engagement, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) the applicable Sellers and their
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies or the Company) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
none of the Group Companies or the Company shall be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of WFandG in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the applicable Sellers and their Affiliates (and
not the Group Companies or the Company) shall hold such property rights and
(c) WFandG shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies or the
Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between WFandG and any of
the Group Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the Company, or any of the Group
Companies and a third party (other than a Party or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company (including on behalf of the Group
Companies) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by WFandG to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor any of the Group Companies may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers.

 



 

12.21 _USD Equivalent_. For the avoidance of doubt, all payments to be
made hereunder shall be payable in U.S. dollars and, to the extent computation
of any amounts contemplated by this Agreement (including the Final Purchase
Price and any of the thresholds or other amounts contemplated by _ARTICLE _
_IX_ ) include a currency, other than U.S. dollar, such amounts shall be
converted to U.S. dollars using the USD Equivalent.
