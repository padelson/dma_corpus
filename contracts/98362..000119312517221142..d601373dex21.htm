General principles 

---|--- 



   

12.6.1

 |

When calculating the liability of the Seller in respect of a Claim (other than
a Claim under the Tax Indemnity), the following amounts shall be deducted: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

any Tax Benefit (either under paragraph (i) or paragraph (ii) of that
definition) arising to any Group Company or member of the Purchasers Group
in connection with such Claim, if any; and 

---|---|--- 



     |

(b)

 |

the amount of any allowance, provision or reserve (including any allowance,
provision or reserve taken into account in calculating the net value of any
asset) in respect of the fact, matter, circumstance or event giving rise to
such Claim which has been made in the Accounts or has otherwise been taken
into account or reflected therein, or has otherwise been taken into account
in calculating the Purchase Price. 

---|---|--- 



   

12.6.2

 |

If any payment has been made by the Seller to the Purchaser in respect of a
Claim (other than a Claim under the Tax Indemnity) and subsequently a Tax
Benefit connected with the facts on which the relevant Claim is based is
received or realized and paragraph (ii) of the definition of Tax Benefit is
applied in accordance with this Agreement, and accordingly such Tax Benefit
was not taken into account in calculating the liability of Seller pursuant to
Clause 12.6.1(a), then Purchaser shall inform the Seller and pay, by way of an
adjustment of the Purchase Price, the amount of such Tax Benefit to
the Seller within 10 (ten) Business Days after such receipt or realization. 

---|--- 



   

12.6.3

 |

If and to the extent the aggregate amount to be deducted in accordance with
Clause 12.6.1 exceeds the amount of the Claim concerned, the excess amount
shall be carried forward and offset against any future liability of the Seller
in respect of any Claim. 

---|--- 



   

12.7

 |

Purchasers Right to Recover 

---|--- 
 



   

12.7.1

 |

If the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group (including the

which has given rise to, or could give rise to, a Claim (a Right to Recover),
other than in relation to the Specific Indemnity, the Purchaser shall: 

---|--- 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  



 |  | Project Grease - share purchase agreement |  |   27  ##### Table of Contents

       |

(a)

 |

notify the Seller of the Right to Recover as soon as reasonably possible; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(b)

 |

use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise and enforce, and ensure that
each relevant member of the Purchasers Group exercises and enforces, each
Right to Recover. 

---|---|--- 



   

12.7.2

 |

The Seller shall not be liable in respect of a Claim (other than in relation
to the Specific Indemnity) to the extent that the Purchaser or any other
member of the Purchasers Group: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

has recovered pursuant to any Right to Recover (after deducting all reasonable
costs incurred by the Purchaser or the Group Company in recovering that sum
and any Tax paid or payable by the Purchaser or the Group Company in relation
to such recovery); or 

---|---|--- 



     |

(b)

 |

would have had a Right to Recover if the insurance policies effected by or for
the benefit of the Group Companies which are in effect as at the date of this
Agreement had been maintained on no less favourable terms after Completion. 

---|---|--- 



   

12.7.3

 |

Where the Seller pays an amount to the Purchaser in respect of a Claim (other
than in relation to the Specific Indemnity) and the Purchaser or any other
member of the Purchasers Group has a Right to Recover which relates (in whole
or in part) to the matter that gave rise to such Claim (other than in relation
to the Specific Indemnity), the Purchaser shall as soon as reasonably
possible notify the Seller thereof and: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

procure that the relevant members of the Purchasers Group take commercially
reasonable efforts to exercise and enforce such Right to Recover; and 

---|---|--- 



     |

(b)

 |

pay (or repay, as the case may be) to the Seller the lower of any amount so
recovered (after deducting all reasonable costs incurred by the Purchaser or
the Group Company in recovering that sum and any Tax paid or payable by the
Purchaser or the Group Company in relation to such recovery) or the relevant
amount paid to the Purchaser by the Seller, in either case within 10 (ten)
Business Days after receipt of the recovered amount. 

---|---|--- 



   

12.8

 |

Obligation to mitigate 

---|--- 
 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Purchaser from any
duty under applicable law to mitigate any loss or damage incurred by it as a
result of any breach of this Agreement, failing of which the Seller shall not
be liable in respect of such Claim to the extent that such failure adversely
affected its position.

 



   

12.9

INDEPENDENT EXPERT PROCEDURE



   

1

 |

Appointment of Independent Expert 

---|--- 
 



   

1.1

 |

The Parties will jointly appoint one of the following accountancy firms as the
Independent Expert, provided that such firm can be considered as independent:
(i) Deloitte, (ii) PwC, (iii) KPMG, (iv) Ernst and Young, or (v) such other
reputable firm of registered accountants ( _registeraccountants_ ) in the
Netherlands with international standing as they may mutually agree. 

---|--- 



   

1.2

 |

If the Parties fail to jointly appoint the Independent Expert within 10 (ten)
Business Days, each of them shall be entitled to request the chairman of the
Netherlands Institute of Chartered Accountants ( _Nederlandse
Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants_ ) to make a binding nomination for the
Independent Expert to be appointed by them from one of the
following accountancy firms: (i) Deloitte or (ii) PwC; provided that such
firm can be considered as independent. 

---|--- 



   

2

 |

Terms of reference for Independent Expert 

---|--- 
 



   

2.1

 |

The terms of reference for the Independent Expert shall be to resolve the
Additional Leakage items still in dispute between the Parties and to
determine, by means of a binding advice ( _bindend advies_ ), the Additional
Leakage Amount (incorporating the Additional Leakage items which are agreed
between the Parties and therefore not within the scope of its determination)
within 20 (twenty) Business Days after its appointment or as soon as
reasonably possible thereafter. The Independent Experts determinations shall
be final and binding on the Parties (in absence of manifest error).  

---|--- 



   

2.2

 |

The Independent Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
shall, subject to the terms of this Schedule, the relevant provisions of the
Agreement and such other terms as may be agreed between the Parties and the
Independent Expert, be entitled to determine the procedure applicable to its
determination. 

---|--- 
 



   

3

 |

Fees and expenses of Independent Expert 

---|--- 
 

The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne by the Seller
and the Purchaser on an inversely proportional basis, based upon the relative
portions of the amounts in dispute that have been submitted to the Independent
Expert for resolution that ultimately are awarded to the Purchaser and/or the
Seller (e.g., if EUR 100,000 is in dispute, and of that amount,
the Independent Expert awards EUR 75,000 to Purchaser and EUR 25,000 to
Seller, then Purchaser will be responsible for 25% and Seller will be
responsible for 75% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Expert).

Conduct of Tax Issues 

---|--- 
 



   

8.1

 |

If the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchasers Group is notified or
becomes aware of any fact, matter, circumstance or event which has given or
is likely to give rise to a claim against any of them and which, in turn, has
given or might give rise to (i) a Claim under the Tax Indemnity or (ii) a
Claim for breach of the Tax Warranties, (each a Tax Issue), the Purchaser
shall and shall procure that the relevant Group Company shall: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

notify the Seller thereof in writing as soon as reasonably possible after
becoming aware of such fact, matter, circumstance or Event and in any case
involving an assessment with a time limit for objection or appeal at least 10
(ten) Business Days before the expiry of that time limit and in any other
case, in any event within 10 (ten) Business Days after becoming aware,
providing reasonable information, including if requested by Seller, copies of
notices, correspondence or other documents that may be relevant for such Tax
Issue; 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(b)

 |

unless agreed otherwise in writing with the Seller, timely file a pro forma
objection ( _bezwaarschrift_ ) with the relevant Tax Authority to the extent
this is permitted by Law with respect to the relevant document received from
such Tax Authority; 

---|---|--- 



     |

(c)

 |

procure that the Seller and the Sellers Representatives shall be granted
reasonable access, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, to the books
and records, premises and relevant personnel of the Group and any other
information relating to the Group which may reasonably be required to enable
them to investigate such Tax Issue; and  

---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |

allow the Seller, at its election, to assume the conduct of the Tax Issue
(such conduct to be all-encompassing, including the right to instruct the
relevant Group Companies which legal counsel to engage and to pursue, settle
or compromise the conduct on their behalf), provided that Seller (i)
acknowledges that Purchaser has a valid and undisputed claim on Seller with
respect to such Tax Issue, (ii) indemnifies the Purchasers Group against any
reasonable costs and expenses of third parties in relation to such Tax
Issue and any other liability, cost, damage or expense reasonably incurred as
a result of such Tax Issue, and (iii) will take no action which is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the liability to Tax of a Group Company for
which the Seller is not liable under this Schedule, provided that the Seller
shall not, or no longer, have the right to assume the conduct if such claim is
criminal in nature or would reasonably be expected to lead to criminal
proceedings. 

---|---|--- 
 



   

8.2

 |

Upon the assumption of the conduct of the Tax Issue by the Seller, the
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies shall: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

act in accordance with any reasonable instructions of the Seller; and 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(b)

 |

provide the Seller, at Sellers costs, with all assistance, information and
documentation reasonably necessary in connection with the Sellers conduct of
the Tax Issue. 

---|---|--- 



   

8.3

 |

The Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Issue not assumed by the
Seller. The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies
shall: 

---|--- 



     |

(a)

 |

on an on-going basis keep the Seller promptly informed of and consult with
the Seller with respect to all material developments in relation to such Tax
Issue; 

---|---|--- 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  



 |  | Project Grease - share purchase agreement |  | ##### Table of Contents

       |

(b)

 |

take all reasonable efforts to keep any Tax Liability or Claim in respect of
such Tax Issue as low as possible;  

---|---|--- 



     |

(c)

 |

take into account any reasonable requests the Seller may have in pursuing the
conduct of any such Tax Issue; and  

---|---|--- 



     |

(d)

 |

take into account any reasonable comments the Seller may have on: 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(i)

 |

any material decisions relating to the conduct of the Tax Issue; 

---|---|--- 
 



     |

(ii)

 |

any material communication to any third party (including any Tax Authority or
competent court in relation to such Tax Issue); and 

---|---|--- 



     |

(iii)

 |

any admission of liability, or any agreement, settlement or compromise of any
kind in relation to such Tax Issue.  

---|---|--- 



   

8.4

 |

The Parties agree to, and the Purchaser shall procure that the Group Companies
will, preserve all information, records and documents that may be required
for the conduct of any Tax Issue until the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations or extensions thereof or for as long as the relevant
dispute continues and, upon reasonable notice, to provide each other access
to all books and records relating to the Group Companies as may be reasonably
required to exercise their rights under this Schedule.
