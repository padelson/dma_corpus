each outstanding Restricted Share shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted
into the right of the holder of such Restricted Share to receive (without
interest), an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (as

through the applicable vesting date, (A) with respect to Restricted Shares
that are not vested in accordance with their terms at the Effective Time, (i)
fifty percent (50%) upon the 60-day anniversary of the date that the Effective

fifty percent (50%) at or promptly after the Effective Time, and (B) with
respect to Restricted Shares that are vested as of the Effective Time in
accordance with their terms, at or promptly following the Effective Time, and

the "Restricted Share Payment Date"); provided, that if the employment of a
holder of Restricted Shares is, following the Effective Time, but prior to the
applicable Restricted Share Payment Date, terminated for any reason other than
(x) by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
for "Cause" (as such term is defined in the Company Stock Plan) or (y) by such
holder without Good Reason, then, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses
(x) and (y), the payment described in this Section 3.2(a) shall be accelerated
to the next practicable payroll date after the date of such termination. For
purposes of this Section 3.2(a), the term "applicable vesting date" means, (X)
with respect to the foregoing clause (A)(i), the 60-day anniversary of the
date that the Effective Time occurs, (Y) with respect to the foregoing clause
(A)(ii), the Effective Time and (Z) with respect to the foregoing clause (B),
the date that the applicable underlying Restricted Share otherwise vested in
accordance with its terms.

(b) Treatment of Performance Share Units. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding PSU (other than any Road to 300 PSU) shall
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder of such PSU
to receive (without interest), an amount in cash equal to (I) the product of
(A) the target number of Shares subject to such PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less (II)
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment (as
provided in Section 3.3(f)), which amount shall vest and be payable by the

date, the "PSU Payment Date"); provided, that if the employment of a holder of
PSUs is, following the Effective Time, but prior to the applicable PSU Payment
Date, terminated for any reason other than (x) by Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) for "Cause" (as such term is
defined in the Company Stock Plan) or (y) by such holder without Good Reason,
then, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the payment
described in this Section 3.2(b) shall be accelerated to the next practicable
payroll date after the date of such termination. Each Road to 300 PSU shall
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time without the
payment of any consideration to the holder thereof. For purposes of this
Section 3.2(b), "applicable vesting date" means, (X) with respect to the
foregoing clause (A)(i), the 60-day anniversary of the date that the Effective
Time occurs, (Y) with respect to the foregoing clause (A)(ii), the Effective
Time and (Z) with respect to the foregoing clause (B), the date that the
applicable underlying PSU otherwise vested in accordance with its terms.

(c) Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Where holders of Restricted Shares or
PSUs are entitled to Accrued Dividends in respect of such awards, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of such awards the cash amounts
in respect of such Accrued Dividends, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment (as provided in Section 3.3(f)), on the
same date that the corresponding payment is made under Section 3.2(a) or
3.2(b) in respect of the underlying Restricted Share or PSU, as applicable.
For PSUs, the total number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which
Accrued Dividends shall be payable shall be determined in the manner set forth
in Section 3.2(b).

(d) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
use reasonable best efforts to take any actions which are necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.2.

(e) Deposit. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate amount owed to holders of
Restricted Shares and/or PSUs (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)). As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to pay the applicable holders of Restricted Shares
and PSUs that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Sections 3.2(a) or
3.2(b), as applicable all amounts required to be paid to such holders in
respect of such Restricted Shares or PSUs through the Company's or the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system or payroll provider, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of
Restricted Shares and/or PSUs pursuant to Sections 3.2(a) or 3.2(b), as
applicable, cannot be made through the Company's or the Surviving
Corporation's payroll system or payroll provider, then Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to issue a check for such payment to such holder, which
check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the
Closing Date (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days thereafter).

3.3 Surrender of Shares.

Company in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(a). (i) At or prior to the
Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, that,
when taken together



-20-

* * *





with the amount to be deposited by the Company pursuant to clause (ii) below,
is sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the Shares that will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a); and (ii) at the Closing,
after all of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at Closing)
or waived (if permissible under applicable Law) and Parent has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that it will consummate the Closing, then the Company
shall, in consultation with and in accordance with the directions having been
given by Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of the Shares that will be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), an
amount of cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries designated by Parent (such
designation to be made no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date), which amount shall not exceed the Available Cash Amount. The
Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;
provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, a
division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of any such bank that are then publicly available), or in money
market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of
the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore, or cause to be replaced
or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or
other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under this Article III
shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Section 3.3(a) shall not be used for any purpose other than as
contemplated by this Section 3.3(a).

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(i) Transmittal Materials. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares, if any ("Certificates"), and
each former holder of record of Shares held in book-entry form ("Book-Entry
Shares") (other than holders of Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) (A)
transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in customary form as
agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing, specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with
respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agent's message"
regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request),
such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may agree prior to the Closing, and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(ii) Certificates. Upon surrender of one or more Certificates to the Paying
Agent, in accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials and
instructions as contemplated in Section 3.3(b)(i) above, the holder of record
of such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A)
the number of Shares represented by such Certificate(s) by (B) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall immediately
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of the Certificates.

(iii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to
deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation in
order to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and
Subsidiary Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's
message" in customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry
Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of such "agent's message" or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in U.S. dollars in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 3.3(f)) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares by
(B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

(iv) Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, is registered, a check for any cash to be
exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, formerly representing such
Shares is properly presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by all reasonable
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

(v) Cash Balances. The Company shall deliver to Parent, upon written request
delivered to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, a written notice delivered no later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date setting forth, in each
case as of the close of business on the immediately preceding Business Day,
the reasonable estimated aggregate cash balances (as determined by the Company
in good faith) held by the Company and its Subsidiaries (by Subsidiary) as
well as the reasonable estimated amounts of such cash balances (as determined
by the Company in good faith) that are not being used for other purposes and
that are available to be utilized in respect of the obligations set forth in
Section 3.3(a) (the "Available Cash Amount").

(vi) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender (together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the applicable Per

Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III. Any Per Share
Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Shares or the Shares
represented by such Certificates, as applicable. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
holders of Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter be
entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 3.3(f)) upon delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, without any
interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 3.3(b)
upon due surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented, and
acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this Article
III, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
Article III. The Per Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in the
case of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable.

(e) Lost Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 3.3(f)) equal to the amount the holder of such Certificate is entitled
as set forth in Section 3.3(b)(ii).

(f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of Shares,
Restricted Shares or PSUs, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts (i) shall
be remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect of which



-23-

such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

3.4 Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event
that the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a different number of
Shares or securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification,

complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material Company
Plan. A "Company Plan" means each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA), and each other employee benefit plan, policy,
program or arrangement providing compensation or benefits, including bonus
plans, employment, severance, fringe benefits, change in control, retention,
incentive equity or equity-based compensation, or deferred compensation
arrangements, in each case, contributed to, sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or pursuant to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has an obligation to contribute as of the date of this
Agreement for the benefit of any current, former or retired employee, director
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
liability, contingent or otherwise, excluding, in each case, the
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA set
forth on Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to each material Company Plan set forth on Section 4.12(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has made available to Parent a
true and complete copy thereof to the extent in writing or in the case of any
unwritten material Company Plan, a written description thereof, and, to the
extent applicable, (i) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument, (ii) the most recent determination letter, if any, received from

for which such summary plan description is required, and (iv) for the most
recent year available (A) the Form 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited

written communications to any Governmental Authority relating to such material

established and administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable Laws,
rules and regulations and (ii) with respect to each Company Plan, as of the
date of this Agreement, no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims
for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened. Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter to that effect
from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist
which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no Company Plan provides for post-employment or retiree health, medical or

of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, or similar Laws at the sole
expense of the former employee.

of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and (ii) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has, during the six-year period ending on the date of this
Agreement, maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any
such plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any unsatisfied
liability under Title IV of ERISA and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
condition exists that is reasonably likely to cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur a liability under Title IV of ERISA. Except as set forth
in Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has, or within the six-year period ending on the date

otherwise obligated under, any plan, policy, agreement or arrangement that

deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
that is subject to Section 409A of the Code is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 409A of the Code.

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution and

any of its Subsidiaries to any compensation or benefit; (ii) accelerate the
time of payment, vesting, or funding, or increase the amount of compensation
or benefit due any such Company Employee or director or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) result in any payments or benefits

the Code or that would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code.

Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement or similar agreement with any labor organization or other
representative of any Company Employees, nor is any such agreement being

Adverse Effect, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened actions or proceedings relating to
employees or employment practices. Except for such instances of noncompliance
as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is, and has been during the past three (3) years, in compliance
in all respects with all federal, state, local and foreign Laws regarding
labor, employment and employment practices. To the Knowledge of the Company,
each employee, officer, director and consultant of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries has all work permits, immigration permits, visas, or other
authorizations required by applicable Law for such service provider given the
duties and nature of such service provider's services. To the Knowledge of the

given written notice to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that such
employee intends to terminate his or her employment.

inquiries, investigations or reviews by any Governmental Authority or internal

Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and under which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries have material continuing obligations.

5.6 Operations and Ownership of Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of

all Laws applicable to Parent and Merger Sub.

5.8 Financing. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtain financing for, or related to, any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct
copies of (i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof,
from the lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents party thereto (the "Debt
Financing Sources") (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto,
and the executed fee letter associated therewith redacted in a manner as
described below, collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to
which the Debt Financing Sources have committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to provide the aggregate amounts set forth
therein (the "Debt Financing") for the purposes of funding a portion of the
Financing Uses and (ii) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, among Parent, the Guarantor and the other parties thereto (including
all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, the "Equity Commitment Letter"
and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters"),
pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, to invest cash in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has also delivered to
the Company true, complete and correct copies of any fee letter with the fee
amounts, economic, financial, dollar and ratio terms (including related dates)
of the "market flex" provision and the economic, financial, dollar and ratio
terms (including related dates) of the securities demand provisions redacted
in a customary manner, none of which redactions covers terms that would (i)
reduce the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to satisfy
the Financing Uses (after taking into consideration the amount of the Equity
Financing and available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or (ii)
impose any new condition or otherwise adversely amend, modify or expand any
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement,
(i) none of the Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or modified
prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) no such amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, by the
other parties thereto (other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or other similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement), and (iii) the respective
commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
such withdrawal, termination or rescission is



-44-

* * *





contemplated. Except for the fee letter referred to above and customary
engagement letters and fee credit letters with respect to the Debt Financing
(none of which (i) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing below the amount
required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into consideration the
amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) imposes any new condition or otherwise adversely amends,
modifies or expands any conditions precedent to the Debt Financing), there are
no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letters delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. As
of the date hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to
the date hereof pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters and Parent
will, directly or indirectly, continue to pay in full any such amounts
required to be paid pursuant to the terms relating to the Debt Financing as
and when they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the
case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto, subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There
are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant to any
"market flex" provisions in the fee letter), other than as expressly set forth
in the Commitment Letters and any related fee letter delivered to the Company
on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
under any of the Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
any other party thereto under the Commitment Letters or (iii) result in any
portion of the amounts to be funded or invested in accordance with the
Commitment Letters being unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, assuming the satisfaction or waiver of conditions to Parent's and
Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger, Parent has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be made available to Parent in full on the Closing Date.
Assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, Parent and Merger Sub will have on the Closing Date funds
sufficient to (i) pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the
other payments under Article III, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid at Closing by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
Merger and the Financing, (iii) prepay or repay any outstanding indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries required by this Agreement to be prepaid or
repaid and (iv) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub contemplated hereunder (clauses (i) through (iv), the "Financing
Uses").

5.9 Parent Guarantee. The Guarantor has furnished the Company with a true,
complete and correct copy of the Parent Guarantee. The Parent Guarantee is in
full force and effect and has not been amended or modified. The Parent
Guarantee is a (a) legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor and of
each of the other parties thereto and (b) enforceable in accordance with its
respective terms against the Guarantor and each of the other parties subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. There is no default under the Parent
Guarantee by the Guarantor, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of
time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by
the Guarantor.

5.10 Ownership of Shares. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any
rights to acquire or vote any Shares, or any option warrant, convertible
security, stock appreciation right, swap agreement or other security, contract
right or derivative position, whether or not presently exercisable, that
provides Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates or
Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement

determined in whole or part with reference to, or derived in whole or part

derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person or such
Person's Affiliates, (b) such derivative is required to be, or capable of
being, settled through delivery of securities or (c) such Person or such
Person's Affiliates may have entered into other transactions that hedge the
economic effect of such derivative.

5.11 Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or
on behalf of each of Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date it (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first filed with the SEC, or at the time it is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or warranty with respect to any statement made in the
Proxy Statement based on information supplied by the Company or any of its
Representatives which is contained or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement.

5.12 Interests in Competitors. Other than as set forth on Section 5.12 of the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.13 Solvency. Assuming (a) that the conditions to the obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have
been satisfied or waived, (b) (i) the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article IV hereof and (ii) the performance by the
Company and its Subsidiaries of the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and (c) that the Required Financial Information fairly presents the
consolidated financial condition of the Company as at the end of the periods
covered thereby and as of the Closing and the consolidated results of earnings
of the Company for the periods covered thereby and as of the Closing, then

consideration to which the stockholders and other equity holders of the
Company are entitled under Article III, the funding of any obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries which become due or payable by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result
of, the Merger and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent.

(xx) agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing actions described
in Section 6.1(b)(i) through Section 6.1(b)(xix).

(c) Without limiting any Parties' rights under this Agreement (including
Section 6.1(b)), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that: (i) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective operations and (iii) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Company has
determined in consultation with its outside legal advisors, no consent of
Parent or Merger Sub shall be required with respect to any matter set forth in
this Section 6.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent the requirement
of such consent would violate any Law. The failure of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to take any actions prohibited by this Section 6.1 shall not
be a breach of this Agreement.

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, during the Interim Period, it
shall not (i) directly or indirectly, engage in any business activities or
incur any liabilities or obligations other than as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) and shall direct each of its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, make any acquisition of (whether by merger,
consolidation or acquisition of stock or substantially all of the assets), or
any investment in any interest in, any Person that would materially delay or
prevent or make illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.2 Access to Information. During the Interim Period and subject to applicable
Laws and Section 6.5(b), Parent shall be entitled (at Parent's sole cost and
expense), through its Representatives, to have such access to the properties,
businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such
examination of the properties, offices, facilities, Contracts, Tax records,
books, records and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it
reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with
Parent's efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Any such access and examination shall be conducted during regular
business hours and under reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to
restrictions under applicable Law. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent and
Parent's Representatives in connection with such access and examination, and
Parent and its Representatives shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the business.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) no such access or
examination shall be permitted to the extent that (i) it would reasonably be
expected to unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) it would reasonably be expected to cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (iii) the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
access or examination would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege (so long as the Company has taken all reasonable steps to
permit such access or examination or to disclose the relevant information and
to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by Parent and its
Representatives based on such information on a basis that does not compromise
the Company's attorney-client privilege with respect thereto) or violate any
applicable Law or result in a breach of or default under any Contract (so long
as the Company has used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
relevant third parties necessary to permit such access or examination), (b)
nothing in this Section 6.2 shall require cooperation to the extent that it
would (i) cause any condition to the Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2
to not be satisfied or (ii) cause any breach of this Agreement and (c) the
Company may elect to limit, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to limit,
disclosure of any information to certain Persons designated, at the request of
the Company, as a "clean team" of Parent (which Persons must be reasonably
acceptable to the Company). Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to cause its and their representatives to, hold all information

provided or furnished pursuant to this Section 6.2 confidential in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, during the Interim Period, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall have any right to perform invasive or subsurface
investigations of the properties or facilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
may be withheld for any or no reason). The Company does not make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided (if
any) pursuant to this Section 6.2, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely
on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as expressly
set forth in the Company's representations and warranties contained in Article
IV; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 by Parent,
Merger Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed to modify any of the
Company's representations and warranties contained in Article IV. No rights
under this Section 6.2 can be exercised by Parent or any of its
Representatives to prepare for, or otherwise in connection with, any Action
relating to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will
not, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.2 for any competitive or other
purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.3 Consents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use (and the
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain all consents and approvals set forth on Section 6.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the consent of Parent
shall be required with respect to any amendment or modification to any
Contract for the purposes of obtaining any such consent or approval that is
adverse in any material respect to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries following the Closing; provided, further, that, except as set
forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
obtaining any such consent or approval shall not be a condition to Closing.

6.4 Further Action; Efforts.

(a) Subject to Section 6.3, without limiting any other covenant in this
Agreement (including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
this Section 6.4, Section 6.12 and Section 6.13), each of the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, agrees to use its
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action,
and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things
necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to (i) consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date
of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other, shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

(b) Each Party will use its best efforts to, and, in the case of Parent, cause
each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Group") to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.4, each
of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall provide or cause to be provided (including by (i) their "ultimate parent
entities" as that term is defined in the HSR Act and (ii) their other
Affiliates) as promptly as practicable to any applicable Governmental
Authority information and documents requested by such Governmental Authority
or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including filing any notification and report
form and related material required under the HSR Act (and any Antitrust



-52-

Law enforced by any Governmental Authority regarding preacquisition
notifications for the purpose of competition reviews) as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act (and any Antitrust Law enforced by any Governmental Authority
regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of competition
reviews). Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (and shall cause
its "ultimate parent entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause)
the filings under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early
termination," and make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be
necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith. Parent shall be
responsible for all fees and expenses in connection with the HSR Act filings
and any fees and expenses of the Company and its Affiliates in responding to
any requests for additional information. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall,
without the written consent of the Company, "pull-and-refile" pursuant to 16
C.F.R. 803.12 any filing made under the HSR Act, or take any similar action
without prior written approval from the Company with respect to any filing
made with any Governmental Authority.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.4(b)
to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations or expiration of waiting
periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law, use its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party; (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish to the
other Party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for
any application or other filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) promptly notify the other Party of any substantive
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority and
of any substantive communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private Party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and, subject to applicable Law, furnish the other Party
promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between
them and the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from, and supply as promptly
as reasonably practicable any additional information or documentation that may
be requested by the DOJ, FTC, or by any other Governmental Authority in
respect of such registrations, declarations and filings or such transactions;
and (v) permit the other Party to review any substantive communication given
by it to, and consult with each other in advance, and consider in good faith
the other Party's reasonable comments in connection with, any communication,
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person.

(d) No Party shall independently participate in any meeting or communication
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation
or other inquiry relating to Sections 6.4(b) or 6.4(c) without giving the
other Parties' sufficient prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting or communication. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, and in furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take any
and all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law or (ii) avoid the entry
of, effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned, any decree, order or judgment that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the contemplated transactions, so as to
enable the Parties to close the contemplated transactions expeditiously (but
in no event later than the Outside Date), including (A) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate

orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition, or license of any
assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of Parent,
Parent's Subsidiaries or the Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest
therein and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that would
limit Parent's, Parent's Subsidiaries or the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain any
assets, properties, products, rights, services or businesses of Parent or the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any interest or interests therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require
Parent to take any action with respect to any direct or indirect portfolio
companies of investment funds advised or managed by one or more Affiliates of
Parent (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its
Subsidiaries).

(e) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.4(d), in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other
agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall, and Parent shall cause each member of the Parent Group to, cooperate in
all respects with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest
and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at their cost and
expense, any action or actions, whether judicial or administrative, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to agree to any term or take any action in connection with its
obligations under this Section 6.4(e) that is not conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger.

(f) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of the
required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Antitrust Laws,
(ii) all approvals under applicable Antitrust Laws are obtained and (iii) the
consents required pursuant to this Section 6.4 are obtained, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates shall acquire or agree to acquire,
by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of
the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or
equity interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to,
or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could
reasonably be expected to: (A) hinder or delay, as applicable, the obtaining
of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR
Act, obtaining the approvals required under other such applicable Antitrust
Laws, obtaining of the consents required pursuant to this Section 6.4, or any
consents of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (C)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, commercially and/or
competitively sensitive information and materials of a Party may, at the
election of a providing Party, be provided to the other Party on an outside
counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in which
the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information has been redacted
available to the other Party.

6.5 Publicity; Confidentiality.

(a) The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press
release of the Parties. Except in connection with (i) a Change of
Recommendation, (ii) any dispute between or among the

material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by a Party in accordance with this Agreement, including in
investor conference calls, SEC filings, QandAs or other publicly disclosed
documents, in each case, to the extent such disclosure is still accurate,
thereafter or (B) as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Authority,
in each case, as determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing
to make such release, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, and in each case shall
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such release, announcement or filing; provided that the Company need not
comply with the foregoing provisions in respect of any public release it
desires to make that is issued in connection with the valid termination of
this Agreement and entry by the Company into a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the Company may, without any consultation

hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall not, and shall

acquisition agreement, option agreement or other agreement relating to any
Acquisition Proposal other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (each,
an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); provided that it is understood and
agreed that any determination or action, in and of itself, by the Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company expressly permitted under
Section 6.6(b) or Section 6.6(c) shall not be deemed to be a breach or
violation of this Section 6.6(a)(iv) or, in the case of Section 6.6(b), give
Parent a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), (v)
fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law, it being understood that, in such instance,
the Company will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive,
any provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent
that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal
being made to the Board of Directors; or (vi) authorize, agree or commit to do
any of the foregoing. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause
to be terminated, any activities, solicitations, discussions or negotiations
with any Person and its Affiliates and Representatives (other than the Parties
and their respective Representatives and designees) in connection with or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case that exists as of the date
hereof. The Company also agrees that it will promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) (I) request each Person (other than the Parties and
their respective Representatives and designees) that has prior to the date
hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company to return or destroy all confidential
information furnished to such Person or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
date hereof and (II) terminate any access to any data room (electronic or
otherwise) previously provided to any such Person, its Affiliates or
Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the (1) valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and (2)
the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours from the receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or bona fide inquiry from any Person or Group in respect
of a potential Acquisition Proposal or if any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives, which notice
shall include (x) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal,
inquiry, request or offer; and (y) a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if written, a copy
thereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis,
of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, or inquiry
or proposal in respect thereof, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.6(a) or Section 6.8,
without limiting Section 6.6(a), nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from:

(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of
the Company) or from making any legally required disclosure to stockholders
with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Board of Directors expressly publicly
reaffirms the Recommendation in such disclosure (other than a customary "stop-
look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company

pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company));

(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (A) participating or
engaging in discussions with or (B) providing access to the Company's or any
of its Subsidiaries' properties, books and records and providing information
or data in response to a request therefor by a Person or Group, that in each
case, has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement that was not solicited in breach of Section 6.6(a) (other than de
minimis breaches), but only if the Board of Directors of the Company (x) shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Superior Proposal,
(y) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (z) has received from the
Person so requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that the Company shall substantially contemporaneously
provide to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information or data that is
provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub;

(iii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, making a change of
Recommendation in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this Section
6.6, if (A) an event, fact, development, circumstance or occurrence (but
specifically excluding any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal) that (w)
does not relate to Parent or Merger Sub, (x) is first arising or occurring
after the date of this Agreement, (y) improves the business, assets,
operations or prospects of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (z) was not
known to the Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof, becomes
known to the Board of Directors of the Company after the date of this
Agreement (an "Intervening Event"), (B) as a result thereof the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (C):

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of its intention to
take such action, which notice will describe the Intervening Event in
reasonable detail; and 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

at least three (3) Business Days prior to effecting such change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event, the Company and its
Representatives have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Board of
Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such change of Recommendation in response to
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable Law and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to
make a presentation (which may be telephonic) to the Board of Directors of the
Company (or a committee thereof) regarding this Agreement and any adjustments
with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation); or 

(iv) resolving or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions, to the extent
such actions would be permitted by the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.6 to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section
6.6(a) (other than de minimis breaches), that such proposal is a Superior
Proposal, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) to contemporaneously with such
termination enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; provided that the Company contemporaneously pays to
Parent any Company Termination Payment required to be paid pursuant to Section
8.3(b)(i); provided further, that the Company will not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)(ii) unless (i) the
Company delivers to Parent a written notice (a "Company Notice") advising
Parent that the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company proposes to
take such action and containing the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action of the Company or
the Board of Directors of the Company, including the identity of the Person or
Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal and copies of all relevant documents (including the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Acquisition Proposal is
proposed to be consummated) relating to such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) at
or after 5:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the third (3rd) Business Day
immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00
p.m. Dallas, Texas time on the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following
the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice (it being understood
that any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new
Superior Proposal and shall require a new notice but with an additional two
(2) Business Day (instead of three (3) Business Day) period from the date of
such notice, the "Notice Period") the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside counsel
and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute
a Superior Proposal. If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, (x) during the Notice
Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and
(y) permit Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation (which may be
telephonic) to the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof)
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation).

(d) Except as provided by Section 6.6(b)(iii) or Section 6.6(c), at no time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of (x) the Closing
and (y) the valid termination of the Agreement may the Board of Directors of
the Company (or a committee thereof):

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, change or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify, change or modify, the
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub; (B) adopt, approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Recommendation within
ten (10) Business Days of the occurrence of a bona fide material event or
development (which is not a direct result of any action by Parent, Merger Sub
or their Affiliates) following the making of an Acquisition Proposal and after
Parent so requests in writing (or, if the Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to
be held within ten (10) Business Days, then such fewer days as are remaining
prior to the Stockholder Meeting) (provided that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not be required pursuant to this clause (C) to publicly reaffirm
the Recommendation on more than two (2) occasions in respect of any such
individual event or development); (D) take any formal action or make any
recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) to the
Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d‑9(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Board of Directors of the Company
(or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered
a violation of this Section 6.6); or (E) fail to include the Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through this clause
(E), a "Change of Recommendation") it being understood that neither (1) the
determination in itself by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a
committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal nor (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of any notice
contemplated by Section 6.6(b)(iii) or Section 6.6(c) will constitute a Change
of Recommendation or violate this Section 6.6; or

(ii) cause, permit or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(e) The Company agrees that any action taken by a Subsidiary of the Company or
Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than an employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is not an executive
or other officer of the Company) that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a material breach of this Section 6.6 will be deemed to constitute
a Willful Breach by the Company of this Section 6.6.

6.7 Proxy Statement.

(a) The Company shall, with the reasonable assistance of Parent, prepare and
file with the SEC, promptly after the date of this Agreement (and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days), the Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
Company shall include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, and anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), or any dissemination thereof to the stockholders of
the Company, or responding to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto,
the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity
to review and to comment on such document or response, which the Company shall
consider in good faith. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the
Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement and shall consider in good faith the
reasonable comments or revisions that Parent may request in writing. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to holders
of Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders Meeting
promptly (but in any event no more than five (5) Business Days) after the date
on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement.

(c) If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by a Party, which information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Party that discovers such



-59-

* * *





information shall promptly notify the other Party and the Company shall
prepare (with the reasonable assistance of Parent) and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable Law. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees
to promptly (i) correct any information provided by it specifically for use in
the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the
information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to
include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Company further agrees to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected or supplemented as promptly as practicable to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to its stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. Except in connection with a
Change of Recommendation or thereafter, no amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without the approval of Parent,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.8 Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Board of Directors of the Company has
made a Change of Recommendation, the Company, acting through its Board of
Directors (or a committee thereof), shall promptly following confirmation by
the SEC that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (but
subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.8), take all action required
under the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws and the applicable
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the "Stockholders Meeting"), with the record date and
meeting date being selected after reasonable consultation with Parent;
provided that the Company may postpone, recess, adjourn or cancel such meeting
(i) to the extent required by Law, (ii) with the written consent of Parent,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to
obtain the Company Requisite Vote or (iv) if as of the time for which the
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
the Stockholders Meeting. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors
(or a committee thereof), shall, subject to Section 6.6(b), (a) include in the
Proxy Statement the Recommendation, (b) reaffirm the Recommendation (which
Recommendation shall, for avoidance of doubt, be in respect of this Agreement
and the Merger, as may be modified pursuant to any changes to the terms of
this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by Parent pursuant to, and in
accordance with Section 6.6(b)(iii) or Section 6.6(c), as applicable) within
five (5) Business Days after a request therefor by Parent following the date
on which any Acquisition Proposal or material modification thereto is received
by the Company or is published, sent or communicated to the Company's
stockholders (or, if the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within
five (5) Business Days, within one (1) Business Day, if possible, before the
Stockholder Meeting) (provided that Parent may not make any such request on
more than one (1) occasion in respect of each Acquisition Proposal or material
modification thereof) and (c) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Requisite Vote, including by soliciting proxies therefor; provided
that the Board of Directors of the Company may fail to include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or withdraw, modify, qualify or change
the recommendation, or formally resolve to effect or publicly announce an
intention to effect any of the foregoing solely in accordance with Section
6.6(b)(iii) or Section 6.6(c) and following such Change of Recommendation, may
fail to use such reasonable best efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
without the prior written consent of Parent, the Stockholder Meeting will not
be postponed or adjourned (A) by more than 10 calendar days at a time without
the prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of Parent; or (B) with respect to Section 6.8(iii), by more than 30
calendar days after the date on which the Stockholder Meeting was (or was
required to be) originally scheduled. In no event will the record date of the
Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this



-60-

Agreement, the Company shall not be required to hold the Stockholders Meeting
if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with its terms.

6.9 Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the delisting
by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from the New York Stock Exchange as
promptly as practicable after (and only after) the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

6.10 Employment and Employee Benefits.

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time
(the "Benefit Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (each, a "Continuing
Employee" and collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), (i) an annual base-
salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term incentive opportunity
(other than equity-based benefits) that in the aggregate are substantially
similar to the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and short term
incentive opportunity that was provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee pension, welfare and
other benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee
pension, welfare and other benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the duration of the Benefit
Continuation Period, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain for the
benefit of each Continuing Employee a severance or termination arrangement no
less favorable than the severance or termination arrangement applicable to
such Continuing Employee set forth in Section 6.10(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed,
the terms of all Company Plans, subject to the amendment and termination
provisions thereof.

(c) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which
Continuing Employees participate, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Company and any Subsidiaries thereof) shall (i) waive or cause to be
waived any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work
requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that it
would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such
service was recognized under a similar Company Plan, give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment with the
Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but
excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each
applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been performed with
Parent; provided, however, that such recognition of service shall not apply
(A) for purposes of any Parent benefit plan under which similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior
service, (B) to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or (C)
for purposes of any plan or arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to the level of benefits or participation.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall



-61-

Active.22007448.8.doc

* * *





interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the
Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy
or program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent from amending or terminating any Company Plans in accordance with their
terms or (iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

6.11 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, to
the extent acting in such capacity) (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any
reasonable and documented costs or expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal in each case arising out of, relating to or in connection with
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including the fact
that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to
the Effective Time) (each, a "Proceeding"), to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under applicable Law or pursuant to any
indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent the Company would have been permitted under applicable Law,
advance expenses (including reasonable and documented legal fees and expenses)
incurred by an Indemnified Party in the defense of any Proceeding, including
any expenses incurred in enforcing such Indemnified Party's rights under this
Section 6.11; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein or otherwise, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.11). In
the event of any such Proceeding (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent relates only to
monetary damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible
or includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of or related to such Proceeding or such Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing, and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter. In the event any
Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party under this Section
6.11, (i) the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii)
each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such Proceeding, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
and documented fees and expenses of one counsel retained by an Indemnified
Party reasonably promptly after statements therefor are received by the
Surviving Corporation, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
control the defense of any such Proceeding, and (iv) no Indemnified Party
shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior express
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

(b) The provisions in the Surviving Corporation's and each of its
Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers shall be
substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in the Company's or such
Subsidiaries' articles of incorporation, bylaws and other similar
organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any such individuals without the prior written consent of
each such individual.

(c) Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for at least six (6)
years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Existing Policies") (provided that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage, with deductibles substantially equivalent to those in
the Existing Policies and containing terms and conditions and providing
benefits that are substantially equivalent to any beneficiary thereof) with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and
from insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance. At the Company's
option, the Company may purchase from insurance carriers with comparable
credit ratings, no later than the Effective Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail
policy" providing at least the same coverage and amounts, with deductibles
substantially equivalent to those of the Existing Policies and containing
terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to the insured than the
Existing Policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby, and from
insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided however that after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay in the aggregate for such coverage under each such policy more than 250%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto under each
such policy, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for
such amount. In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy",
the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect for such
six (6) year period. Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries to honor and perform under all indemnification agreements
entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party prior to the date hereof.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates, restructures, recapitalizes, merges
with or into any other Person or otherwise reorganizes and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation,
restructuring, recapitalization, merger or other restructuring or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. Nothing in this

officers and employees, it being understood that the indemnification provided

claims under any such policies.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this

Section 6.11 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11).

6.12 Financing.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Financing not later than the date Closing is required to be
effected in accordance with Section 2.2 on the terms and conditions described
in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters and any related fee letter
(including complying with any request requiring the exercise of so-called
"market flex" provisions in the fee letter) (or on other terms that, with
respect to conditionality, are not less favorable to Parent than the terms and
conditions (including any "market flex" provisions) set forth in the
Commitment Letters and any related fee letter so long as such other terms
would not (and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result, event or
consequence described in any of clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.12(d)),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and
effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and execute definitive
agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall
not be required until reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of
the Debt Financing) with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter (which may reflect
"market flex" provisions) (or on other terms that, with respect to
conditionality, are no less favorable to Parent than the terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee letter (including any "market
flex" provisions applicable thereto) so long as such other terms would not
(and would not reasonably be expected to) have any result, event or
consequence described in clauses (A) through (D) of Section 6.12(d)), in each
case, which terms shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to the
funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing below the amount required to satisfy the Financing Uses (after
taking into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) unless the Equity Financing is
correspondingly increased (such definitive agreement, the "Definitive
Financing Agreements") and (iii) satisfy and comply with on a timely basis
(or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of) all conditions and
covenants applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and
such Definitive Financing Agreements that are within their control that are to
be satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub and to consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing, which such reasonable best efforts shall include, for
the avoidance of doubt, taking enforcement action (including by instituting
litigation in respect thereof) to cause the Debt Financing Sources and Persons
committing to provide the Financing to comply with their obligations under the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements and to cause the
Debt Financing Sources and such Persons to fund such Financing at the Closing.
Parent shall, upon the request of the Company, keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of any material developments
concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. Upon the
request of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the
Company with copies of any Definitive Financing Agreements and such other
material information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall
be reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall release or consent
to

the termination of obligations of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements except in connection
with the addition of banks, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
other similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of
the date of this Agreement.

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and any related fee
letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, notify the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing on terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions) that are at least as favorable to
Parent and Merger Sub as those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
related fee letter (including the "market flex" provisions) from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing
that is and remains available and available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to pay the amount required by the Financing Uses ("Alternative Financing")
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and to
obtain and provide the Company with a copy of, the new financing commitment
that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter"), which Alternative Financing Commitment Letter will not
(i) include terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions
applicable thereto) that are less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto), (ii) involve any conditions to funding of the
Debt Financing that are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter or (iii)
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of, and not
in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but any
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing (or alternative bridge
facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 6.12(b)) are available on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, then Parent shall
to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such

to Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter shall include the Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter and (iii) to Definitive Financing Agreements shall
include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative
Financing.

(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Company of the
occurrence of any of the following: (i) termination, repudiation, rescission,
cancellation or expiration of any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreement, (ii) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) under any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreement by any party to such Commitment Letter or Definitive
Financing Agreement or (iii) receipt by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates of any written notice or other written communication
from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or
alleged breach, default, termination, rescission or repudiation by any party
to any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement or any provision of
any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement or (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter
or Definitive Financing Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Financing Uses (after taking
into account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) on the terms and in the manner contemplated by
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements.

Days), Parent shall provide to the Company and its Representatives any and all
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in this Section 6.12(c).

amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination or other
modification or waiver of any provision or remedy under, (i) the Equity
Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of Equity Financing
available thereunder) without the prior written consent of the Company or (ii)
the Debt Commitment Letters, without the prior written consent of the Company,
if such amendment, restatement, supplement, termination, modification or
waiver would (A) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the funding
of the Financing or would otherwise adversely change, amend, modify or expand
any of the conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing, (B) be
reasonably expected to prevent or delay the availability of all or a portion
of the Financing necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into
account the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (C) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below
the amount necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account
the amount of the Equity Financing and available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or (D) otherwise adversely affect the ability of the Parent or Merger
Sub to enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters; provided that Parent
may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Parent shall furnish
to the Company a copy of any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement,
modification, waiver or consent of or relating to the Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Financing Agreements as promptly as practicable upon execution
thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the Commitment Letters until the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated. For purposes of this Agreement
(other than with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Parent
or Merger Sub that speak as of the date hereof), (i) references to the
"Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters
as permitted by this Section 6.12 to be amended, restated, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified or waived and (ii) references to the "Debt
Commitment Letter", "Equity Commitment Letter" or "Commitment Letters" shall

from and after such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement or other
modification or waiver.

(e) Notwithstanding any in this Section 6.12 to the contrary, compliance by
Parent and Merger Sub with this Section 6.12 shall not relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement whether or not the Financing is available and each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are not contingent on Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to
obtain the financing (or any alternative financing) or any specific term with
respect to such financing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Section 6.12 will require, and in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than a counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any material fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter.

of the assistance required under Section 6.13(a) as compared to the assistance
that would be required or expected to be required in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this Agreement and the related Debt
Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiary's
logos in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that
is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage the Company or
the Company's Subsidiaries.

(c) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts, to update any
Required Financial Information provided to Parent and the Debt Financing
Sources as may be necessary so that such Required Financial Information (i) is
Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition
of "Required Financial Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect
to such update(s), cause the Marketing Period to cease pursuant to the
definition of "Marketing Period." For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to
most effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.13 at any time, and from
time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the
Closing Date. The Company agrees to (i) file all reports on Form 10-K and Form
10-Q and, to the extent required to include financial information pursuant to
Item 9.01 thereof, Form 8-K and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to file all
other Forms 8-K, in each case, required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time periods
required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing
effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests
the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act
that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and
its subsidiaries, which information Parent reasonably determines (and the
Company does not unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering
memorandum or other marketing materials for the Debt Financing, then the
Company shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

(d) Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and
all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with their
cooperation in arranging the Debt Financing and the performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 6.13 and the provision of any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by the Company or its Subsidiaries), in each case, other than to the extent
any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this
Agreement by, the Company and its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their
respective Representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon request of the
Company, reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including those of its Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with the
cooperation required by this Section 6.13.

6.14 Treatment of Company Indebtedness.

(a) Prepayment of Indebtedness. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts,
and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to
deliver to Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a
copy of a payoff letter (subject to the delivery of funds as arranged by
Parent) with respect to the Credit Facility (the "Subject Indebtedness") in
customary form, which payoff letter shall (i) indicate the total amount
required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment
premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other monetary obligations then
due and payable under the Subject Indebtedness as of the anticipated Closing
Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the "Payoff Amount"), (ii) state that
upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under such payoff letter, the Subject
Indebtedness



-69-

and all related loan documents shall be terminated and (iii) provide that all
Liens and guarantees in connection with the Subject Indebtedness relating to
the assets and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing
the obligations under the Subject Indebtedness shall be released and
terminated upon payment of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date. At Closing,
the Surviving Corporation shall repay the outstanding amount of the Subject
Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds as provided for
in the payoff letter.

(b) Senior Notes.

(i) Parent will be permitted to commence and conduct, in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, one or more offers to purchase, including any "Change
of Control Offer" (as such term is defined in the Indenture) and/or any tender
offer, or any exchange offer, and to conduct a consent solicitation, if any
(each, a "Debt Offer" and collectively, the "Debt Offers"), with respect to
any or all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date
hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent; provided that any such Debt
Offer is consummated using funds provided by Parent. Parent shall not be
permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer until Parent shall have
provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, letter of
transmittal or other related documents in connection with the Debt Offer
(collectively, the "Debt Offer Documents") a reasonable period of time in
advance of commencing the applicable Debt Offer to allow the Company and its
counsel to review and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will
reasonably consult with the Company regarding the timing and commencement of
any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or,
if applicable, effectiveness) of the Debt Offers shall be expressly
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing or the acceptance for purchase of
the Senior Notes by Parent or Merger Sub, and the parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Debt Offers to close on the Closing Date; provided
that the consummation of a Debt Offer with respect to the Senior Notes shall
not be a condition to Closing. The Debt Offers shall be conducted in
compliance with the Indenture and applicable Law, including SEC rules and
regulations, and the Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect
to any Debt Offer that is not in compliance with the Indenture and applicable
Laws. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with
this Section 6.14, Parent and the Company shall comply with the applicable Law
and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this
Agreement by such compliance.

(ii) Subject to the receipt of any requisite consents, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in
accordance with the Indenture, amending the terms and provisions of the
Indenture as described in the Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by
Parent, which supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than
the Effective Time or the acceptance for purchase of the Senior Notes by
Parent or Merger Sub, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Trustee to enter into such supplemental indenture prior to or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing as determined by Parent; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company or any of its officers, directors or other
Representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any
amendments or other agreement that is not permitted under applicable Law or
would become operative prior to the Effective Time or the time of acceptance
for purchase of the Senior Notes by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, in
each case, use their reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the execution of
supplemental indentures. If requested by Parent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its legal counsel to provide all customary
legal opinions required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Section 6.14 to the extent such legal opinion is required to be delivered
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
the Company or its legal counsel



-70-

* * *





be required to give an opinion with respect to a Debt Offer that in the
opinion of the Company, its legal counsel or the Trustee does not comply with
applicable Laws or the Indenture, or an opinion with respect to financing by
Parent or Merger Sub.

(iii) If requested by Parent, in lieu of or in addition to Parent commencing a
Debt Offer for the Senior Notes, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, to (A) issue one or more
notices of optional redemption for all or a portion of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (which may be delivered at
Parent's request in advance of the Closing Date so long as they are contingent
upon the occurrence of the Closing (it being understood and agreed that they
may also be contingent upon the occurrence of other events in addition to the
Closing)), pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture and (B) take
any other actions reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the
satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes pursuant to the satisfaction
and discharge provisions of the Indenture and the other provisions of the
Indenture applicable thereto; provided that prior to, or substantially
concurrently with, the Company being required under clause (A) above to issue
any notice of redemption to be issued substantially simultaneously with the
Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be, deposited with
the Trustee under the Indenture sufficient funds to effect such redemption and
satisfaction and discharge. If a conditional notice of redemption is given,
Parent shall ensure that at the Effective Time, so long as the applicable
conditions of such redemption are satisfied, the Company has all funds
necessary in connection with any such redemption and satisfaction and
discharge. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts
to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
this Section 6.14.

(iv) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable outside attorneys' fees) to the extent incurred by the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or the Trustee in connection with this Section 6.14.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the Company Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with any action taken by them in connection

7.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither the Company nor Parent may
rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or terminating this
Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth
in Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such
failure was primarily caused by such Party's breach in any material respect of
any provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

Party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such Party

either such case, such breach or failure is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured prior to the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice

8.2 Procedure Upon Termination. Subject to Section 8.3, in the event of a
valid termination by Parent or the Company, or both, pursuant to Section 8.1
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party or
Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made (other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(a)), and
this Agreement shall terminate and be null and void, and the Merger shall be
terminated, without further action by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.

8.3 Effect of Termination.

(a) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, in the event of
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void without any further force or effect and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party hereto (or
any direct or indirect equity holder, controlling person, partner, member,
manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other
representative of such Party or such Party's Affiliates or its or any of the
foregoing's successors or assigns), except, and subject in all respect to this
Section 8.3, Section 10.1 and Section 10.13 (in each case, including the
limitations set forth herein and therein), as provided in Section 6.5
(Publicity; Confidentiality), Section 6.13(d) (Financing Assistance), Section
6.14(b)(iv), this Section 8.3 (Effect of Termination), Section 8.4 (Expenses),
Article IX (Additional Agreements) and Article X (General Provisions), which
shall survive such termination; provided that, subject in all respects to the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.3, Section 10.1 and Section 10.13,
nothing herein shall relieve (i) the Company of any liability for damages
resulting from fraud or Willful Breach prior to such valid termination of this
Agreement, or (ii) Parent of any liability for damages resulting from fraud
prior to such valid termination of this Agreement (in each of the case of
clause (i) and this clause (ii), which the Parties acknowledge and agree will
not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs (including
for the avoidance of doubt the payment of the Parent Expenses), and in the
case of any damages sought by the non-breaching Party, including any Willful
Breach, such damages will include the benefit of the bargain lost by the non-
breaching Party, taking into consideration relevant matters, including
opportunity costs and the time value of money). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Parent Related Parties,
collectively, have any liability for monetary damages (including damages for
fraud or breach, whether willful, intentional, unintentional or otherwise
(including Willful Breach) or monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance) in the aggregate in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount and
subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(g). No
valid termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of
any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or the Parent Guarantee,
which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to
affect their right to specific performance in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 10.1.

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii), then the Company shall
pay the Company Termination Payment to Parent (or one of its Affiliates or
designees) (A) at or prior to the date of termination in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) or (B) as promptly as reasonably
practicable in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) (and,
in any event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination),
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b) or 8.1(f) or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(i) and (A) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the receipt of the Company Requisite Vote an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made to the Company or its Representatives or the Company's stockholders,
or an Acquisition



-76-

Active.22007448.8.doc

* * *





Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known or announced and (B)
within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
or shall have consummated any Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event,
the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Payment, such payment
to be made concurrently with the earlier of (x) two (2) Business Days from the
consummation of any Acquisition Proposal, and (y) the entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. For the purpose of this Section 8.3(b)(ii), all
references in the definition of the term Acquisition Proposal to "15% or more"
will be deemed to be references to "more than 50%."

(iii) this Agreement is validly terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(e)(i) or (B) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more of its designees) promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing to
the Company, an amount immediately available funds equal to that required to
reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby up to $6,250,000 (the "Parent Expenses").

(iv) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i) (and such material breach or material failure to perform by Parent
or Merger Sub is the primary reason for the failure of the Closing to be
consummated) or Section 8.1(g), Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of
$74,200,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing to Parent,
such payment to be made within two (2) Business Days of the applicable
termination.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Parent
Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and the Company Termination Payment, as
applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 8.3, shall not
constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in
which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge
and hereby agree that in no event shall either the Company be required to pay
the Company Termination Payment or Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that the damages resulting from
the termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Company
Termination Payment, Parent Termination Fee or Parent Expenses is or are
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to Sections 8.3(b)(i),
8.3(b)(ii) or 8.3(b)(iii), or Parent fails to timely pay an amount due
pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
suit that results in a final non-appealable judgment against the Company for
the amount set forth in Sections 8.3(b)(i), 8.3(b)(ii) or 8.3(b)(iii), or any
portion thereof, or a final non-appealable judgment against Parent for the
amount set forth in Section 8.3(b)(iv), or any portion thereof, as the case
may be, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or
Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket outside attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of
any expert or consultant engaged by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable) in connection with such suit in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000
(the "Expense

payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of
such payment. Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) shall be paid
by the applicable Party by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the
date such payment is required to be made under this Section 8.3(d).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise but subject to Section 10.13, in any circumstance in which this
Agreement is terminated and Parent is paid the Company Termination Payment
from the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Company Termination
Payment, the Parent Expenses and, if applicable, the costs and expenses of
Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(d) (subject in all respects to the Expense Cap)
shall, subject to Section 10.1, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
Related Parties against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of its or their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, representatives, agents or any their respective
assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or limited
partner, stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer,
employee, Affiliate, representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of
the foregoing (collectively, "Company Related Parties") for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or any other transaction to
be consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents or any certificate, agreement or
other document delivered in connection herewith, therewith or otherwise or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such amounts, none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
(monetary or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or any certificate, agreement or other documents
delivered in connection herewith, therewith or in respect of representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, therewith or otherwise,
whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, except that
notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.3(e) and/or payment of one or
more of the Company Termination Payment, the Parent Expenses and, if
applicable, any amounts owed pursuant to Section 8.3(d), shall not relieve the
Company from liability for fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement, or
from any of its obligations under Section 6.5(b).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
otherwise, but subject to Section 8.3(g), Section 8.3(h) and Section 10.13, in
any circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and the Company or any
Affiliate or designee thereof is paid the Parent Termination Fee from Parent
pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Parent Termination Fee and, if applicable,
the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(d) (subject in
all respects to the Expense Cap), and the reimbursement obligations set forth
in Sections 6.13(d) and 6.14(b)(iv), shall, subject to Section 10.1, be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantor, any of their respective former, current or future equityholders,
controlling Persons, limited or general partners, managers, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, stockholders,
assignees or Representatives (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") and
the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the failure of the Merger or any other transaction to be
consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or any certificate, agreement or other
document delivered in connection herewith, therewith or otherwise or in
respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith and upon payment of such amounts, none of the
Parent Related Parties or Debt Financing Sources Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation (monetary or otherwise) relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any certificate,
agreement or other document delivered in connection herewith, therewith or in

otherwise, except that nothing shall relieve Parent of its obligations under
Sections 6.5(b), 6.13(d) and 6.14(b)(iv); provided, that the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing shall not apply to claims, if any,
against any Person that is a party to and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any other
agreement referenced herein or therein or otherwise, under no circumstances
may the Company receive both (i) an award of monetary damages, on the one
hand, and (ii) any of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any of the amounts, if
any, as and when due, pursuant to Section 8.3(d), on the other hand, and in
any event, the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Company to receive

agreements, shall survive the Effective Time, except for (a) those covenants
and agreements contained herein that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time and (b) those contained
in Sections 4.28, 5.15, and 5.17 or this Article IX, which, in each case,

ARTICLE X 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1 Remedies; Specific Performance.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damages for which monetary damages,
even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject in all respects to Section 10.1(b), the Parties shall be entitled to
seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without any requirement for the posting of security, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,
subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The Parties hereby
further acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, subject in all
respects to Section 10.1(b), the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to
prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement, including Sections 6.4 and 6.12,
by Parent and/or Merger Sub and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with Section 2.2, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement. The pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable
remedies by any Party hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or
waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in
equity) to which such Party may be entitled at any time.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject in
all respects to this Section 10.1, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that
the Company shall be entitled to seek specific



-80-

* * *





performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to consummate the Closing if, but only if, (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been and continue to
be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied at
the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing provided for by the Debt Commitment
Letter has been funded or will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) Parent and Merger Sub are required
to complete the Closing pursuant to Section 2.2 and Parent or Merger Sub fails
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.2 and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Parent that, if specific performance is granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will occur,
and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within two (2) Business
Days after delivery of such irrevocable written confirmation; provided, that
the Company remains ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing during
such two (2) Business Day period. In no event will the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing
(i) will not be simultaneously funded with the Equity Financing or (ii) has
not been funded in full.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) either Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, for the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may concurrently seek (i) specific
performance, subject in all respects to this Section 10.1 and (ii) payment of
the Parent Termination Fee or monetary damages, if, as and when required
pursuant to this Agreement, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive (1) both a grant of specific performance to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, monetary damages and/or any of the
other amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant to Sections 6.13(d),
6.14(b)(iv) and 8.3(d), on the other hand, or (2) both payment of any monetary
damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of any of the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any of the amounts, if any, as and when due, pursuant
to Sections 6.13(d), 6.14(b)(iv) and 8.3(d), on the other hand.

in order to confer jurisdiction over it, and Parent stipulates that such
