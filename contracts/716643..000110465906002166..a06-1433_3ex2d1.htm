the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date therefor
after the Effective Time payable with respect to shares of Regis Common Stock

any other rights of a shareholder of Regis. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional share, cash adjustments will be paid to holders in
respect of any fractional share of Regis Common Stock that would otherwise be
issuable, and the amount of such cash adjustment shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying such stockholders fractional share of Regis
Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable by the closing price per share
of Regis Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Tape on the Closing Date.

such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to

Fund, as directed by Regis, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and

shall be paid to Regis promptly upon request by Regis. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Regis shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such payment obligations.

  

### 

  

### (h) Regis or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Alberto-Culver Common Stock as of the Alberto-Culver Record Date

withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are

of Alberto-Culver Common Stock as of the Alberto-Culver Record Date in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Regis or the

### (d) _Reports and Financial Statements_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Regis has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses,
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC since July 1, 2003 (collectively, including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Regis SEC Reports_"). No Subsidiary of Regis
is required to file any form, report, registration statement, prospectus or
other document with the SEC. Each of the Regis SEC Reports, at the time it
was filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing), complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes Act_ ") and the NYSE and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as applicable, and none of such
Regis SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Regis Filed SEC Reports contain
the audited consolidated balance sheet of Regis and its Subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related audited consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and shareholders equity for the fiscal years ended June
30, 2005 and 2004 (such statements, together with the notes thereto, the "
_Regis Financial Statements_ "). Each of the Regis Financial Statements and
each of the other financial statements (including the related notes) included
in the Regis SEC Reports fairly presents, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of Regis and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates or for the respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied
during the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and subject,
in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments.  All Regis SEC Reports, as of their
respective filing dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the
respective Regis SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects to
the extent in effect at the time of filing, with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes Act and the NYSE and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Except as disclosed in the Regis SEC Reports filed after July 1,
2003 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (the " _Regis Filed SEC
Reports_ ") or in the Regis Financial Statements, since July 1, 2005, Regis
and its Subsidiaries have not incurred any liabilities that are of a nature
that would be required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of
Regis and its Subsidiaries or in the footnotes thereto prepared in conformity
with GAAP, other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
or that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Each of the principal executive officer of Regis and the principal
financial officer of Regis (or each former principal executive officer of
Regis and each former principal financial officer of Regis, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Act with respect to the
Regis SEC Reports and the statements contained in such certifications are
true, complete and correct. For purposes of this _Section 5.1(d)_,

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

#### "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes Act.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Regis and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.  Regis
(A) has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by Regis in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to Regiss management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Regis
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls
and procedures prior to the date hereof to Regiss auditors and the audit
committee of Regiss Board of Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Regiss ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Regiss internal controls over financial reporting.  Regis has delivered to
Alberto-Culver and Spinco any such disclosure made by management to Regiss
auditors and the audit committee of Regiss Board of Directors.

  

#### 

  

### (e) _Information Supplied_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Regis
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Form S-4
will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading and (B) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, on
the date it is first mailed to Regis shareholders or Alberto-Culver
stockholders or at the time of the Regis Shareholders Meeting or the Alberto-
Culver Stockholders Meeting, respectively, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.1(e)_,
no representation or warranty is made by Regis, Merger Sub or Subco with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by or on
behalf of Alberto-Culver or Spinco for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

Issuance and the Regis Charter Amendment are advisable and in the best
interests of Regis and its shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement, the

resolved to recommend that the shareholders of Regis (A) approve the Regis
Share Issuance and (B) approve the Regis Charter Amendment and directed that

"fair price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other form of
anti-takeover statute or regulation under Minnesota law or any anti-takeover
provision in the Articles of Incorporation of Regis, By-laws of Regis or
other similar organizational documents of Regis is, or at the Effective Time
will be, applicable to the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Agreements.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Votes Required_. The only votes of the holders of capital stock or
other securities of Regis necessary in connection with the Regis Share
Issuance, the Regis Charter Amendment, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Required Regis
Votes_ ") are the affirmative vote of holders of (i) a majority of the shares
of Regis Common Stock represented at the Regis Shareholders Meeting and
entitled to vote (provided that a majority of the shares of Regis Common

Issuance Vote_ ") and (ii) a majority of the shares of Regis Common
Stock represented at the Regis Shareholders Meeting and entitled to vote

### 

  

### (h) _Litigation; Compliance with Laws_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Except as set forth in the Regis Filed SEC Reports or in the Regis
Financial Statements, there is no suit, action, arbitration, proceeding,
claim, charge, regulatory or accrediting agency investigation or other
proceeding (an " _Action_ ") pending or, to the Knowledge of Regis,
threatened against Regis or any Subsidiary of Regis or any property or asset
of Regis or any Subsidiary of Regis which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis, nor
is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Regis or any Subsidiary of Regis
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Regis.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis, Regis and its
Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities which are necessary for the

(the " _Regis Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation of any of the
Regis Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Regis, threatened, except
for suspensions or cancellations which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis.

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

#### Regis and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the
Regis Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Regis. None of Regis or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation
of, and Regis and its Subsidiaries have not received since July 1, 2003 any
written notices of violations with respect to, any Applicable Laws, except
for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis.

this Agreement, except as set forth in the Regis Filed SEC Reports, none of
Regis or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken during

and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid

#### (iii) None of Regis or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, and
Regis has no Knowledge of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance,
that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of

set forth in the Regis Tax Certificate, if made on the date hereof (assuming

#### (vii) None of Regis or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make, or is
required to make, any material adjustment affecting any open taxable year or

deductions, credits or allowances, or of any item or element affecting
taxable income, by reason of Section 482 of the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (ix) Neither Regis nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or
similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign Applicable Laws), as a

guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

maintained pursuant thereto, has been determined to be so qualified and
exempt from federal income Taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the
Internal Revenue Service, and to the Knowledge of Regis, nothing has occurred
with respect to the operation of any such Regis Plan that would reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification of exemption from Tax.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) As of the date hereof, none of Regis or any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability under or obligation to any Multiemployer Plan and no Regis Plan

or (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or materially
increase the amount of compensation, due any such employee, director or

the Knowledge of Regis, there are no labor union organizing activities with
respect to any employees of Regis or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) since

Subsidiaries and any other offering circulars previously used by Regis
and its Subsidiaries do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in

  



  

29   

     
   

  



  

#### order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for such
untrue statements or omissions that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Regis.
Regis and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Applicable Laws
(including, in the United States, the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular
Guidelines adopted by the North American Securities Administrators
Association) relating to the offer and sale of Regis Franchises and the
relationship between Regis and its Subsidiaries and their
respective franchisees, except where the failure to so comply, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Regis.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The franchise agreements and other agreements of Regis and its
Subsidiaries granting rights to a Regis Franchisee do not obligate Regis or
any of its Subsidiaries to buy back or otherwise acquire any amount of stock,
assets or contractual rights of the Regis Franchisee, where such amounts
would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Regis and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Regis and its Subsidiaries do not (1)
guaranty any obligations of any Regis Franchisee that, individually or in the
aggregate with such other guaranties, are material to Regis and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) have any Contracts to lend or advance
money to a Regis Franchisee that, individually or in the aggregate with such

its Subsidiaries consolidated in such Tax Returns. Since October 1, 2000, no

circumstance, that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of Alberto-
Culver and Spinco, the representations set forth in the Alberto-Culver
Tax Certificate, if made on the date hereof (assuming the Distribution and
the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, were consummated on the

information not available on the date hereof), would be true and correct in
all material respects.

Tax sharing or Tax indemnity agreements entered into after October 1, 2000
(other than the Tax Allocation Agreement and any agreements between or among
Spinco and its Subsidiaries) that could reasonably be expected to result in a
material Tax liability to Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Other than with respect to the Distribution, within the past five
years, none of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to
qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) None of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to make any
payments, or is a party to any Contract or Spinco Plan that could obligate it
to make any payments, that would not be deductible by reason of Section
162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) None of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make, or
is required to make, any material adjustment affecting any open taxable year

#### (viii) Since October 1, 2000, none of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries
has been required to reallocate, or is subject to an IRS or other
Governmental Entity challenge that would require the reallocation of, gross
income, deductions, credits or allowances, or of any item or element
affecting taxable income, by reason of Section 482 of the Code.

#### (ix) Neither Alberto-Culver nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or
similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign Applicable Laws), as a
transferee or successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise
for any Taxes of any person other than Alberto-Culver or any of its
Subsidiaries.

#### (x) Neither Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
"reportable transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b) (not including Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(6)), or
any transaction that is the same as or substantially similar to one of the
types of transactions the IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance
transaction and identified by notice, regulation, or other form of published
guidance as a "listed transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

any member of the Alberto-Culver Group (excluding purchase orders made in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). Each Contract
of the type described in this _Section 5.3(l)_ is referred to herein as a "
_Spinco Material Contracts_." Neither Spinco nor any of its Subsidiaries has
Knowledge of, or has received notice of, any violation of or default
under (or any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Spinco Material
Contract or any other Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any
of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. As of the date of this Agreement, neither

true and complete list of each material Spinco Plan. With respect to each
material Spinco Plan, Spinco has made available to Regis a true, correct and
complete copy of: (A) all plan documents, trust agreements, and insurance
contracts and other funding vehicles; (B) the two most recent Annual Reports
(Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedules and exhibits, if any; (C) the
current summary plan description and any material modifications thereto, if
any (in each case, whether or not required to be furnished under ERISA); (D)
the two most recent annual financial reports, if any; (E) the two most recent
actuarial reports, if any; and (F) the most recent determination letter from

the extent applicable, all material provisions of ERISA, the Code and all
other Applicable Laws and regulations. Each Spinco Plan has been operated
and administered, in all material respects, in accordance with its terms.
Except as set forth in _Section 5.3(m)(ii)_ of the Spinco Disclosure
Schedule, no Spinco Plan is (or was, during the past six years) subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. No liability under Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA has been incurred by Spinco or any of its ERISA Affiliates and
other Subsidiaries that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to Spinco or any of its ERISA Affiliates

#### (iii) As of the date hereof, each Spinco Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust
maintained pursuant thereto, has been determined to be so qualified and
exempt from federal income Taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the
Internal Revenue Service, and to the Knowledge of Spinco and Alberto-Culver,
nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any such Spinco Plan
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification of
exemption from Tax.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) As of the date hereof, none of Spinco or any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability under or obligation to any Multiemployer Plan and no Spinco
Plan is a

#### Multiemployer Plan. The Spinco Plans provide benefits only to current
and former Spinco Employees.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) Except as contemplated by the Employee Matters Agreement or this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A)

benefits, or materially increase the amount of compensation, due any such
Spinco Employee.

its Subsidiaries; (ii) no labor organization or group of Spinco Employees has
made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and there are

activities with respect to any Spinco Employees and (iii) since October 1,
2003, there have been no actual, or to the Knowledge of Spinco, threatened

### 

  

### (p) _Liens_. No Liens exist on any assets of Spinco or any of its

### 

  

#### (i) Spinco has provided to Regis a true, correct and complete list of
all states in the United States and countries or jurisdictions in which

Spincos and its Subsidiaries Uniform Franchise Offering Circulars and any
other international disclosure documents (" _Spinco UFOCs_ "), which are
currently being used in connection with the offers to sell and the sales of
its franchises. The Spinco UFOCs currently used by Spinco and its
Subsidiaries and any other offering circulars previously used by Regis
and its Subsidiaries do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except for such untrue statements or
omissions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. Spinco and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Applicable Laws (including, in the
United States, the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular Guidelines adopted by
the North American Securities Administrators Association) relating to
the offer and sale of Spinco Franchises and the relationship between Spinco
and its Subsidiaries and their respective franchisees, except where the
failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) The franchise agreements and other agreements of Spinco and its
Subsidiaries granting rights to a Spinco Franchisee do not obligate Spinco or
any of its Subsidiaries to buy back or otherwise acquire any amount of stock,
assets or contractual rights of the Spinco Franchisee, where such amounts
would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Spinco and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Spinco and its Subsidiaries do not (1)
guaranty any obligations of any Spinco Franchisee that, individually or in
the aggregate with such other guaranties, are material to Spinco and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) have any Contracts to lend or advance
money to a Spinco Franchisee that, individually or in the aggregate with such
other Contracts, are material to Spinco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Spinco has delivered to Regis a true, correct and complete copy of the
current form or forms of franchise agreement used by Spinco and its
Subsidiaries.
