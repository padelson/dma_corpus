AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of October 26, 2020, by and among: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "); Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ ");
and Xilinx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

A. The parties intend that Acquisition Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with this Agreement and the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). Upon consummation
of the Merger, Acquisition Sub will cease to exist and the Company will
continue as the Surviving Corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

B. The Company Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the Merger is fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and (iii) recommended that the
Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement.

C. The Parent Board has unanimously: (i) determined that the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and
its stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection therewith, each on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and (iii)
recommended that Parents stockholders approve the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

D. The board of directors of Acquisition Sub has: (i) determined that it is
advisable and in the best interests of Acquisition Sub and its sole
stockholder for Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement; (ii) approved
and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger; and (iii) recommended that its sole stockholder
adopt this Agreement.

 

E. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger will
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and that this Agreement is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

   

SECTION 1\. THE MERGER

 

1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate
existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. From and after the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, powers, privileges and franchises of the Company and
Acquisition Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation and all of the
debts, obligations, liabilities, restrictions and duties of the Company and
Acquisition Sub shall become the debts, obligations, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

1.2 Closing. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall be held
(a) at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, CA
94025, or (b) remotely by exchange of documents and signatures (or their
electronic counterparts), in either case unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties to this Agreement, on a date to be designated jointly
by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder and by
applicable Legal Requirements, waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived
of all conditions to the parties respective obligations to effect the Merger
set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 5.1_, _5.2_ and _5.3_ , other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions at the
Closing, unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_ ". Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, the parties shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ ") and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in
connection with effecting the Merger. The Merger shall become effective on
the date and at such time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as may be mutually agreed to
in writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective being referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(a) Subject to the requirements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.13(a)_, at
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
in its entirety to read as the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub
until thereafter changed or amended as set forth in the form of certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.13(a)_, the parties hereto shall take all
requisite actions so that, from and after the Effective Time, the bylaws of
the Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to conform to the
bylaws of Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except (i) for the provisions thereof referring to the name of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall instead be amended to refer to "Xilinx,
Inc.", and (ii) for the provisions of Article VI of the bylaws of the Company,
which shall not be amended and shall remain in effect as Article VI of the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation upon the Effective Time, and as so amended
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements, subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.13(a)_.

 



2

    

1.4 Directors and Officers.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and the Surviving Corporations Organizational Documents: (i) the
directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation; and (ii) the officers of
Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such actions as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate such that, as of the Effective Time, the
Parent Board shall include at least two directors designated by the Parent
Board (after reasonable consultation with, and reasonable consideration of
the recommendations of, the Company) from among the directors serving on the
Company Board as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of whom must
qualify as an "independent director" under applicable Nasdaq rules and
regulations. Each of such directors shall hold office until the earliest to
occur of the appointment or election and qualification of his or her
respective successor or his or her death, resignation, disqualification or
proper removal as a member of the Parent Board. Parent agrees to nominate such
individuals appointed to the Parent Board pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.4(b)_ for reelection at Parents first annual stockholders meeting that
occurs after the Closing.

1.5 Conversion of Securities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company
or any stockholder of the Company:

 

(a) all shares of Company Common Stock that are held in the Companys treasury
or are held directly by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid or payable in respect thereof;

 

(b) except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_, each share of Company
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest,
a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the per share consideration payable
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, the " _Merger Consideration_
"); and

 

(c) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.6 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock are changed or converted into a different number or class or
series of shares by reason of any stock split, division, combination,
change, exchange or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split,

 



3

    

 consolidation of shares, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization
or other similar transaction, or a record date with respect to any such event
shall occur during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 1.6_ shall be construed to permit the parties to take any action except
to the extent consistent with, or not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of
this Agreement.

1.7 Treatment of Equity Awards.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Option held by an
individual who, as of immediately after the Effective Time, constitutes an
"employee" of Parent within the meaning of Form S-8 that is outstanding and
unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, an " _Assumed Company Option_ ") shall cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be assumed by Parent and
converted automatically into a Parent Option on the same terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) as applied
to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed
Company Option shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product
down to the nearest whole share; and (ii) the per share exercise price of each
Assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing: (A) the per share
exercise price of the Assumed Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such quotient up
to the nearest whole cent.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs held by an
individual who, as of immediately after the Effective Time, constitutes an
"employee" of Parent within the meaning of Form S-8 that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Assumed Company RSU
Award_ ") shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock upon vesting and shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically
into a restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock and shall otherwise remain subject to the same vesting and other terms
and conditions that applied to the underlying Company RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that: (i) after giving any effect to clause (ii)
below, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
Assumed Company RSU Award shall be determined by multiplying: (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time; by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole number and (ii) with respect to each Assumed Company
RSU Award that vests based on the achievement of one or more performance
criteria, the Company shall determine the number of earned Company RSUs
subject to such award based on actual, or, in the event the Closing occurs
during or after the Companys fiscal year 2022, the greater of target-level
and actual, performance through a date that is not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing, any unearned Company RSUs based upon such
determination shall be forfeited as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and any earned Company RSUs shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_ and shall vest on the time-based vesting schedule
applicable to the Company RSUs following achievement in accordance with their
terms but based on service to Parent and its Affiliates.

 



4

    

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate
action necessary to provide that the vesting of each Company Option and each
Company RSU held by a non-employee member of the Companys Board of Directors
shall accelerate in full and, in the case of Company RSUs, be settled, in
each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate action
necessary to provide that each Company Option that does not constitute an
Assumed Company Option and each Company RSU that does not constitute an
Assumed Company RSU Award, and in each case, which is not
accelerated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)_ shall be terminated for no
consideration as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery with respect
to all Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company RSU Awards. Parent shall
file and cause to be effective as of no later than the Effective Time, a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or other
appropriate form under the Securities Act, relating to shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable with respect to all Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company
RSU Awards, and Parent shall use its best efforts cause such registration
statement to remain in effect for so long as such Assumed Company Options and
Assumed Company RSU Awards remain outstanding.

 

1.8 No Fractional Shares.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares
shall be issued.

(b) Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.5(b)_ (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise issuable to such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_) shall,
in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ")
or book-entry positions representing non-certificated shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Company Book-Entry Shares_ ") in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.10_, be
paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest and subject to any required tax withholding, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Average Parent Stock Price. No such holder
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been
issuable as part of the Merger Consideration. The payment of cash in lieu
of fractional share interests pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(b)_ is not
a separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

1.9 Closing of Transfer Books.

 

At the Effective Time:

(a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and all holders of Company Stock Certificates and of Company Book-Entry
Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except
(unless such holder is subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_) the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.8(b)_ and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.10(f)_; and

 



 



5

    

(b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or a Company
Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Share shall be cancelled and shall be exchanged as provided in _Section_ __ _
1.10_.

1.10 Exchange of Certificates and Cancellation of Book-Entry Positions.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select Parents transfer agent or
(after consultation with the Company) another reputable bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company to act as exchange agent
with respect to the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to or concurrent
with the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent: (i) certificates or evidence of book-entry shares representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_; and
(ii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.8(b)_. The shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 1.10(a)_, together with any dividends or distributions received by the
Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and any
interest or other income with respect to such cash amount, are referred to
collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash available in the Exchange Fund in obligations, funds or accounts typical
for (including having liquidity typical for) transactions of this nature as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that no losses on such investments shall
affect the cash payable to former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1_ (and Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient to replenish any deficiency in
the Exchange Fund).

(b) With respect to Company Stock Certificates, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the

or distributions, in each case, that a holder of such Company Stock
Certificates or Company Book-Entry Share has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1_ in respect of such Company Stock Certificate or

requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the transfer of shares of Parent Common Stock to a
Person other than the registered holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the officers and directors of Parent

otherwise) be fully authorized to take such action.

to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement any amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or any other applicable
Legal Requirement relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and, if required, paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

Company Subsidiary, and there is no agreement between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any employee or independent
contractor of the Company or Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, that will

amended from time to time, or domestic legislation implementing such directive
into the national applicable law of any country in the EEA, as amended from
time to time, or any legislation that has substantially the same effect in
any country outside the EEA. For purposes of this Section, " _EEA_ " means

Subsidiary of all Company Permits required under applicable Environmental Laws
to conduct their respective business and operations), and there are no
investigations, actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each
case, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not constituted or
resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. During the three-year period prior to the

Company or any Company Subsidiary is violating, or has or may have, violated
any Environmental Law, or may have any liability or obligation arising under,

there has been no release of any hazardous materials by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary at or from any facilities owned or leased by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, at any other
locations where any hazardous materials were generated, manufactured,
refined, transferred, stored, produced, imported, used, processed or disposed
of by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and, in each case, for which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary would 

 



31

    

 reasonably be expected to be subject to any liability, except as,
individually or in the aggregate, has not constituted or resulted in and would
not reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.18_ and _Section_ __ _
3.13_, " _Environmental Law_ " shall mean any Legal Requirement relating to
pollution or protection, preservation or restoration of the environment
(including air, surface water, groundwater, drinking water supply, surface
land, subsurface land, plant and animal life or any other natural resource),
including any such Legal Requirement regulating emissions, discharges or
releases of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances, exposure to or
release of, or the management of any hazardous materials.

 

2.19 Insurance. Since January 1, 2018, neither the Company nor any Company

any Company Subsidiary of any: (a) premature cancellation or invalidation of
any material insurance policy held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary;
or (b) refusal of any coverage or rejection of any material claim under any
insurance policy held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. As of the date
of this Agreement, there is no pending material claim by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary against any insurance carrier under any material
insurance policy held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries maintain insurance with reputable insurers in
such amounts and against such risks as the management of the Company has in
good faith determined to be prudent and appropriate in all material respects.
Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not constituted or resulted
in and would not reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, all insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are in full force and effect,
all premiums and other payments due on such policies have been paid by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary and all claims thereunder have been filed in
due and timely fashion, and neither the Company nor any of Company Subsidiary

taken any action that could permit cancellation, termination or
modification of, any such insurance policies.

(a) Since January 1, 2018, all Company Products that are sold and currently
supported by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been provided in
conformity with the Companys and its Subsidiaries applicable contractual
commitments, warranties and specifications, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Companys warranty reserve reflected on the Most Recent Company
Balance Sheet was calculated utilizing historical warranty experience rates
consistent with past practice and, to the knowledge of the Company, was
sufficient as of the date of the Most Recent Company Balance Sheet to cover
the unexpired warranty liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
any products (including Company Products) sold by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to their respective customers as of the date of the Company
Balance Sheet, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Since the date of the Most Recent Company Balance Sheet, the Company has not

knowledge of the Company, the Companys current warranty reserve is
sufficient as of the date hereof to cover the unexpired warranty liabilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any products (including Company
Products) sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries to their respective
customers as of the date hereof, except as, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

substantially concurrently with providing any non-public information to such
third party, the Company shall make such non-public information available to
Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously made
available by the Company to Parent). The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) inform Parent if the Company furnishes non-public
information and/or enters into discussions or negotiations as provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_ and will keep Parent reasonably informed in
writing, on a current basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the
status and terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes to the terms thereof) and the status of any discussions and
negotiations with respect thereto.

 

(b) If the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
request for information with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or
that is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, then the
Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after its receipt
of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request) notify Parent in writing of
such Company Acquisition Proposal or request (which notification shall include
the identity of the Person making or submitting such request or Company
Acquisition Proposal and an unredacted copy of any such written request or
proposal (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof)),
together with copies of any proposed transaction agreements, and the Company
shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed in writing, on a current
basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the status of such Company
Acquisition Proposal or request, including informing Parent of any material
change to the terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, and the status of
any negotiations, including any change in its intentions as previously
notified.

(c) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Person
(other than Parent and its Representatives) relating to any Company
Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date hereof and any access any such
Persons may have to any physical or electronic data room relating to any
potential Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any
standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of
its Affiliates is a party.

(d) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_
by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any Representatives of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _
4.2_ by the Company.

 

4.3 Parent No Solicitation.

 

(a) Parent will not, and Parent will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives not to, except as expressly permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries regarding, or the submission or announcement by any Person of, any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Parent Acquisition Proposal;

 

(ii) furnish any information regarding Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
(other than to the Company and its Subsidiaries), or afford access to
Parents or its Subsidiaries Representatives, books, records or property, in
each case, in connection with, for the purpose of soliciting, initiating,
encouraging or facilitating, or in response to, any inquiry, proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Parent Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(iv) approve, adopt, recommend, agree to or enter into, or propose to approve,
adopt, recommend, agree to or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in
principle with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal; or

 

(v) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Required
Parent Stockholder Vote, Parent and its Representatives may engage or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide
information to, any Person (or its Representatives) that has made a _bona
fide_ written Parent Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not
result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
4.3(c)_ by

 



55

    

 Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives if: (A) prior to taking any such action, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal and that failure to engage in such
discussions or negotiations, or provide such information, would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary duties to Parent
and its stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; and (B) prior
to providing any information regarding Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
such third party in response to such Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent
receives from such third party (or there is then in effect with such party) an
executed confidentiality agreement that contains nondisclosure provisions
that are at least as restrictive of such third party as the Non-Disclosure
Agreement and that does not prohibit compliance by Parent with this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.3_. Prior to or substantially concurrently with providing
any non-public information to such third party, Parent shall make such non-
public information available to the Company (to the extent such non-public
information has not been previously made available by Parent to the Company).
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) inform the Company
if Parent furnishes non-public information and/or enters into discussions or
negotiations as provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ and will keep
the Company reasonably informed in writing, on a current basis (and, in any
event, within 24 hours), of the status and terms of any Parent Acquisition
Proposal (including any material changes to the terms thereof) and the status
of any discussions and negotiations with respect thereto.

(b) If Parent receives a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or
request for information with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or that
is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, then Parent
shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after its receipt of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal or request) notify the Company in writing of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal or request (which notification shall include the
identity of the Person making or submitting such request or
Parent Acquisition Proposal and an unredacted copy of any such written
request or proposal (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions
thereof)), together with copies of any proposed transaction agreements, and
Parent shall thereafter keep the Company reasonably informed in writing, on a
current basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the status of such
Parent Acquisition Proposal or request, including informing the Company of any
material change to the terms of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and the
status of any negotiations, including any change in its intentions as
previously notified.

(c) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Person (other than
the Company and its Representatives) relating to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal made prior to the date hereof and any access any such Persons may
have to any physical or electronic data room relating to any potential Parent
Acquisition Proposal. Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or
grant permission under, or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in any
agreement to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party.

(d) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_
by any of Parents Subsidiaries or any Representatives of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ by
Parent.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the
SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in preliminary form, and Parent
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4 Registration
Statement, in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, in preliminary
form, will be included as a prospectus. Each of the parties shall: (i) use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to comply in all material respects with all
applicable rules, regulations and requirements of the Exchange Act or
Securities Act; (ii) promptly notify the other upon receipt of, and cooperate
with each other and use reasonable best efforts to respond to, any comments
or requests of the SEC or its staff, including for any amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 Registration Statement of Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; (iii) promptly provide the other party with copies of
all written correspondence and a summary of all oral communications between it
or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, relating to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; (iv) use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after it is filed with the SEC; (v) use reasonable
best efforts to keep the Form S-4 Registration Statement effective through the
Closing in order to permit the consummation of the Merger; and (vi) cooperate
with, and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment in advance on the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including any amendments or supplements to the Form S-4
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and any
substantive correspondence (including all responses to SEC comments), prior
to filing with the SEC or mailing, and shall provide to the other a copy of
all such filings or communications made with the SEC, except to the extent
such disclosure or communication relates to a Company Acquisition Proposal or
Parent Acquisition Proposal. The Company will, prior to filing the preliminary
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, obtain all necessary consents of the Company
Financial Advisors to permit the Company to include in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus the opinion of the Company Financial Advisors
that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinion, the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Parent will, prior to filing the
preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, obtain all necessary consents of
the Parent Financial Advisors to permit Parent to include in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus the written opinion of the Parent Financial Advisors
that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and limitations set forth in such opinion, the Exchange
Ratio set forth in this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent.

(b) Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after receipt of notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 Registration Statement becomes
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto, or the suspension of the shares of Parent Common
Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC or
its staff for any amendment of or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as practicable
have any stop order relating to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or any
such

 



57

    

 suspension of the shares of Parent Common Stock lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be mailed to Parents stockholders, and the Company shall cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, in each
case as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of the parties shall
promptly furnish the other parties all information concerning such party, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably available to
such party) stockholders that may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements or reasonably requested by the other party or its Representatives
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_. If,
at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote or
Required Parent Stockholder Vote, any party becomes aware of any information
that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4
Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in order to
make any statement therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it
is made, not false or misleading with respect to a material fact, or in order
to avoid the omission of a material fact necessary to make the statements in
the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
not misleading, then such party: (A) shall promptly inform the other party
thereof; (B) shall provide the other party (and its counsel) with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
prior to it being filed with the SEC; (C) shall provide the other party with a
copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is filed with the SEC;
and (D) if mailing is required by law or otherwise appropriate, shall
cooperate in mailing such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of
Parent or the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all other actions required
to be taken under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder, or any applicable state securities or "blue sky"
laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, including the
Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of converted Company
Options and upon vesting of converted Company RSUs; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall not be required to qualify to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or file a general consent to
service of process in any jurisdiction.

 

4.5 Meeting of the Companys Stockholders; Company Change in Recommendation.

 

(a) The Company: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable
Legal Requirements and the Companys Organizational Documents to, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective (and in any event within 45 days thereafter), duly call,
give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock to vote on a proposal to adopt this Agreement (the " _Company
Stockholder Meeting_ "); and (ii) shall submit such proposal to, and, except
in the case where the Company Board has made a Company Change in
Recommendation in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_, use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such proposal from, such holders
at the Company Stockholder Meeting, and the Company shall not submit any
other proposal to its stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company, in
consultation with Parent, shall set a record date 

 



58

    

 for determining the Persons entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the Company shall not postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent, other than: (1) to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that
any supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the
Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation with Parent and
outside counsel is required by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to
the Companys stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be promptly
disseminated to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of
time (as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting; (2) if
required by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the SEC or its
staff; or (3) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business to be conducted at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B) the
Company may, and if Parent so requests at any time prior to the date that is
four months from the date the Form S-4 Registration Statement shall have
become effective, shall, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement if, on the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled, there would be insufficient votes to obtain the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, in which case, except in
the case where the Company Board has made a Company Change in Recommendation
in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or adjournment to solicit
and obtain such proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable; _provided_ that without the prior written consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, in the cases of clauses (A)(1) and
(A)(2)), (x) no single such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clauses
(A) or (B) shall be for more than five (5) Business Days, except as may
be required by applicable Legal Requirements and (y) all such adjournments
and postponements together shall not cause the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting to be more than twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled or, in the case of the
foregoing clauses (A)(3) and (B), less than five (5) Business Days prior to
the End Date. Subject to the foregoing and applicable Legal Requirements, (I)
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Company Stockholder Meeting to initially be called for the same
date as the Parent Stockholder Meeting; and (II) if, notwithstanding such
efforts, the Parent Stockholder Meeting is initially called for a date prior
to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to call its meeting on a date that is as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting. The Company
shall use reasonable efforts to, on a daily basis during the ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, advise Parent as to
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at
the Company Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by the
Company with respect to the Required Company Stockholder Vote and the number
of such proxies authorizing the holder thereof to vote in favor of
the Required Company Stockholder Vote.

 



59

    

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement, including by _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_: (i) withhold, withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation, or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable
(or publicly propose to do so) any Company Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to
publicly announce, within ten (10) Business Days after a tender offer or
exchange offer relating to the equity securities of the Company shall have
been commenced by any third party other than Parent and its Affiliates (and in
no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 4.5(a)_), a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the avoidance of doubt, the
taking of no position or a neutral position by the Company Board in respect of
the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer as of the end of
such period shall constitute a failure to publicly announce that the Company
Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer); or (iv) if
requested by Parent, fail to issue, within ten (10) Business Days after a
Company Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced (and in no event later than
one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, as
it may be postponed or adjourned pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_), a press
release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation (any action described in
clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a " _Company Change in
Recommendation_ "); (v) cause or permit the Company to enter into any
Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle or other arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.2(a)_)
contemplating or relating to a Company Acquisition Transaction; (vi) take any
action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover or similar statute or
regulation inapplicable to any Company Acquisition Proposal or counterparty
thereto; or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the
Company Board may make a Company Change in Recommendation related to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement if
and only if (x) the Company receives from a third party a _bona fide_ written
Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that has not
been withdrawn and did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ and
(y) prior to making such Company Change in Recommendation and/or authorizing
the Company to terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal:

 

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements;

(ii) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (the " _Company Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") no less than four (4) Business Days in advance stating
that the Company Board intends to make a Company Change in Recommendation
and/or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include
the identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and a copy
of such proposal and a draft of the definitive agreement to be entered into in
connection therewith (or, if not in writing, the material terms and
conditions thereof);

 



60

    

(iii) (A) during the four (4) Business Day period commencing on the date of
Parents receipt of such Company Superior Proposal Notice, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding a
possible amendment of this Agreement so that the Company Acquisition Proposal
that is the subject of the Company Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a
Company Superior Proposal; and (B) after the expiration of the negotiation
period described in clause (A) above, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that
Parent and Acquisition Sub have committed in writing to make as a result of
the negotiations contemplated by clause (A) above, that such Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that if there is any change to any of the financial terms or any
other material terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall,
in each case, be required to deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (ii) above and a new negotiation period under
clause (A) above shall commence (except that the original four (4) Business
Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above shall instead be equal to
the longer of (1) three (3) Business Days and (2) the period remaining under
the original four (4) Business Day notice period of clause (A) above), during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)(iii)_ anew with respect to such additional notice
(but substituting the time periods therein with the foregoing three (3)
Business Day period); and

(iv) in the case of the Company terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, the Company
shall have paid, or caused the payment of, the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the
Company Board may make a Company Change in Recommendation that is not related
to a Company Acquisition Proposal if and only if any state of fact, event,
change, effect, circumstance, occurrence or development, or combination
thereof, arises following the date of this Agreement (I) that (x) was neither
known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of
this Agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company
Board, the consequences of which were neither known to nor reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (y) is
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and
(II) that is not related to (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company
Superior Proposal or any inquiry or communications relating thereto, any
matter relating thereto or consequences thereof, (B) in each case in and of
itself, any changes in the market price or trading volume of Company Common
Stock or the fact that the Company meets, fails to meet or exceeds any
internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any
period (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause of any of the
foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant to clauses (A),
(C) or (D)), (C) any event, condition or circumstance related to Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or (D) any changes in Legal Requirements (any
such state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance,

 



61

    

 occurrence, development, condition, circumstance, or combination thereof,
being referred to as a " _Company Intervening Event_ "); and, prior to making
such Company Change in Recommendation, (1) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, a failure
to effect a Company Change in Recommendation would be reasonably expected to
be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to its stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) less than four (4) Business Days
prior to the making of such Company Change in Recommendation, Parent receives
a written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board intends to
effect such Company Change in Recommendation, specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail; (3) during such four (4) Business Day period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the
Company Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation; and (4) following
the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor and after taking into account any amendments to this Agreement that
Parent and Acquisition Sub have committed in writing to make as a result of
the negotiations contemplated by clause (3) above, that, in light of such
Company Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements, even if such changes committed to in writing were to be given
effect.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless this
Agreement has been earlier terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
6.1_ (including by the Company in order to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Company Superior Proposal), this Agreement shall be
submitted to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the Company
Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this
Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
the Company of such obligation.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company, the
Company Board or their Representatives from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) directing any Person (or the Representative of that
Person) who makes a Company Acquisition Proposal to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of either
clause (i) or clause (ii), no such communication or statement that would
constitute a Company Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made or
taken except in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)_.

 

(g) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_
by any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or any Representatives of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 4.5_ by the Company.

 



62

    

4.6 Meeting of Parents Stockholders; Parent Change in Recommendation.

 

(a) Parent: (i) shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements and Parents Organizational Documents to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared
effective (and in any event within 45 days thereafter), duly call, give notice
of and hold a meeting of the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock to vote
on a proposal to approve the Parent Share Issuance (the " _Parent Stockholder
Meeting_ "); and (ii) shall submit such proposal to, and, except in the case
where the Parent Board has made a Parent Change in Recommendation in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_, use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies in favor of such proposal from, such holders at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting, and Parent shall not submit any other proposal to its
stockholders in connection with the Parent Stockholder Meeting without the
prior written consent of the Company. Parent, in consultation with the
Company, shall set a record date for determining the Persons entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall ensure
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent Stockholder Meeting
are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (A) Parent shall not postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company, other than: (1) to
the extent reasonably necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the Parent Board has determined in
good faith after consultation with the Company and outside counsel is required
by applicable Legal Requirements is disclosed to Parents stockholders and
for such supplement or amendment to be promptly disseminated to Parents
stockholders within a reasonable amount of time (as determined by the Parent
Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel) prior to the
Parent Stockholder Meeting; (2) if required by applicable Legal Requirement or
a request from the SEC or its staff; or (3) if as of the time for which the
Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting; and (B) Parent may, and if the Company so requests at
any time prior to the date that is four months from the date the Form S-4
Registration Statement shall have become effective, shall, postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the approval of the Parent Share Issuance, if, on the date for which
the Parent Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, there would be insufficient votes
to obtain the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, whether or not a quorum is
present, in which case, except in the case where the Parent Board has made a
Parent Change in Recommendation in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts during any such postponement or
adjournment to solicit and obtain such proxies in favor of the approval of the
Parent Share Issuance as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ that
without the prior written consent of the Company (not to be
unreasonably withheld in the cases of clauses (A)(1) and (A)(2)), (x) no
single such adjournment or postponement pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) shall
be for more than five (5) Business Days, except as may be required by
applicable Legal Requirements and (y) all such adjournments and postponements
together shall not cause the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting to be more
than twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the Parent Stockholder
Meeting was originally scheduled or, in the case of the foregoing clauses
(A)(3) and (B), less than five (5) Business Days prior to the End Date.
Subject to the foregoing and applicable Legal Requirements, (I) Parent shall
cooperate with the Company and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Stockholder Meeting to initially be called for the same date as the
Company Stockholder Meeting; and (II) if, notwithstanding such efforts, the
Company Stockholder Meeting is initially called for a date prior to the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
call its meeting on a date that is as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to, on a daily basis during the ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, advise the Company as to
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Parent Stockholder Meeting for which proxies have been received by Parent
with respect to the Required Parent Stockholder Vote and the number of such
proxies authorizing the holder thereof to vote in favor of the Required Parent
Stockholder Vote.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
shall include the Parent Board Recommendation. Neither the Parent Board nor
any committee thereof shall, except as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement, including by _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_: (i) withhold, withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify (or publicly propose to withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify), in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation,
or fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable (or
publicly propose to do so) any Parent Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail to
publicly announce, within ten (10) Business Days after a tender offer or
exchange offer relating to the equity securities of Parent shall have been
commenced by any third party (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the date of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or
adjourned pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_), a statement disclosing that
the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for
the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the
Parent Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or
exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to
publicly announce that the Parent Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer); or (iv) if requested by the Company, fail to issue, within
ten (10) Business Days after a Parent Acquisition Proposal is publicly
announced (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date
of the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as it may be postponed or adjourned
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.6(a)_), a press release reaffirming the Parent
Board Recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv) being
referred to as a " _Parent Change in Recommendation_ "); (v) cause or permit
Parent to enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or other arrangement or understanding
(other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_) contemplating or relating to a Parent Acquisition
Transaction; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any anti-takeover
or similar statute or regulation inapplicable to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal or counterparty thereto; or (vii) publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent
Board may make a Parent Change in Recommendation related to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal and authorize Parent to terminate this Agreement if and
only if (x) Parent receives from a third party a _bona fide_ written Parent
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that has not been
withdrawn and did not result from a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ and (y)
prior to making such Parent Change in Recommendation and/or authorizing Parent
to terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal:

(i) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
Parents outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and that failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Parent Boards fiduciary duties to Parent and its stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements;

 



64

    

(ii) Parent delivers to the Company a written notice (the " _Parent Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") no less than four (4) Business Days in advance stating
that the Parent Board intends to make a Parent Change in Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of
the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such proposal
and a draft of the definitive agreement to be entered into in connection
therewith (or, if not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof);

(iii) (A) during the four (4) Business Day period commencing on the date of
the Companys receipt of such Parent Superior Proposal Notice, if requested by
the Company, Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company
regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement so that the Parent
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Parent Superior Proposal
Notice ceases to be a Parent Superior Proposal; and (B) after the expiration
of the negotiation period described in clause (A) above, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement that the Company has committed in writing to make as a result
of the negotiations contemplated by clause (A) above, that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that if there is any change to any of the financial terms or any
other material terms of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, Parent shall, in
each case, be required to deliver to the Company an additional notice
consistent with that described in clause (ii) above and a new negotiation
period under clause (A) above shall commence (except that the original four
(4) Business Day notice period referred to in clause (A) above shall instead
be equal to the longer of (1) three (3) Business Days and (2) the period
remaining under the original four (4) Business Day notice period of clause
(A) above), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the
requirements of _Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)(iii)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice (but substituting the time periods therein with the
foregoing three (3) Business Day period); and

(iv) in the case of Parent terminating this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall
have paid, or caused the payment of, the Parent Termination Fee in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent
Board may make a Parent Change in Recommendation that is not related to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal if and only if any state of fact, event, change,
effect, circumstance, occurrence or development, or combination thereof,
arises following the date of this Agreement (I) that (x) was neither known to
nor reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board as of the date of this
Agreement (or, if known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Parent Board, the
consequences of which were neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the
Parent Board as of the date of this Agreement) and (y) is material to Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (II) that is not related
to (A) a Parent Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Superior Proposal or any
inquiry or communications relating thereto, any matter relating thereto or
consequences thereof, (B) in each case in and of itself, any changes in the
market price or trading volume of Parent Common Stock or the fact that Parent
meets, fails to meet or exceeds any internal or published projections,
forecasts or estimates of its

 



65

    

 revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations
for any period (it being understood, however, that any underlying cause of any
of the foregoing may be taken into account unless excluded pursuant to
clauses (A), (C) or (D)), (C) any event, condition or circumstance related to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (D) any changes in Legal
Requirements (any such state of fact, event, change, effect, circumstance,
occurrence, development, condition, circumstance, or combination thereof,
being referred to as a " _Parent Intervening Event_ "); and, prior to making
such Parent Change in Recommendation, (1) the Parent Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that, in light of such Parent Intervening Event, a failure to effect
a Parent Change in Recommendation would be reasonably expected to
be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary duties to Parent and its
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (2) less than four (4)
Business Days prior to the making of such Parent Change in Recommendation, the
Company receives a written notice from Parent confirming that the Parent
Board intends to effect such Parent Change in Recommendation, specifying the
reasons therefor in reasonable detail; (3) during such four (4) Business Day
period, if requested by the Company, Parent engages in good faith
negotiations with the Company to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change in
Recommendation; and (4) following the end of such four (4) Business Day
period, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any
amendments to this Agreement that the Company has committed in writing to
make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause (3) above, that,
in light of such Parent Intervening Event, a failure to effect a Parent Change
in Recommendation would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
Parent Boards fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements, even if such changes committed to in writing were to be given
effect.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement
has been earlier terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_
(including by Parent in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Parent Superior Proposal), the Parent Share Issuance shall be
submitted to the holders of shares of Parent Common Stock at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of the approval of the Parent Share
Issuance and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
the Parent of such obligation.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent, the Parent
Board or their Representatives from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement to the stockholders of Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii)
directing any Person (or the Representative of that Person) who makes a
Parent Acquisition Proposal to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.6_;
provided, however, that in the case of either clause (i) or clause (ii), no
such communication or statement that would constitute a Parent Change in
Recommendation shall be permitted, made or taken except in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.6(c)_.

 

(g) Any violation of the restrictions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.6_
by any of Parents Subsidiaries, or any Representatives of Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ by
Parent.

4.7 Filings; Other Action.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End
Date) and to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing
promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary and advisable
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws) that are or
may become necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the End Date) all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Entity or third party that are or may become necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ " shall mean the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as amended, and all other applicable Legal Requirements issued by a
Governmental Entity that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(b) Each party shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to file, as
soon as practicable and advisable after the date of this Agreement, all
notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to submit as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Entity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other: (i) within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (or such other date as
may be mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company), prepare and file the
notifications required under the HSR Act; and (ii) as promptly as practicable
and advisable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than as
required by applicable Legal Requirements, prepare and file, or pre-file with
regard to any Governmental Entity that requires such pre-filing prior to any
formal filing of, all other notifications required under any Legal
Requirement with respect to any other Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Company
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional information
or documentary material received from any state attorney general, antitrust
authority or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust or related
matters.

 



67

    

(c) Subject to the provisions of each of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
Clean Team Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement, Parent and the Company
each shall promptly supply the other with any information that may be required
in order to effectuate any filings (including applications) pursuant to (and
to otherwise comply with its obligations set forth in) _Section_ __ _ 4.7(a)_
and _Section_ __ _ 4.7(b)_. Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems
advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate competitively sensitive
material provided to the other as "outside counsel only" or with similar
restrictions. Each of Parent and the Company may also reasonably redact the
material as necessary to (i) comply with other contractual arrangements or
applicable Legal Requirements or (ii) prevent the loss of protection under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction
indicates, and be subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense
agreement between the parties. Except where prohibited by applicable Legal
Requirements or any Governmental Entity, and subject to the provisions of each
of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Clean Team Agreement and the Joint
Defense Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall: (i) consult with the
other in good faith prior to taking a position with respect to any filing
required or advisable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.7(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
4.7(b)_; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs,
white papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting
any of the foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party
in connection with any such filing or any Legal Proceeding in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) coordinate with
the other in preparing and exchanging such information; (iv) promptly provide
the other partys counsel with copies of all filings, notices, analyses,
presentations, memoranda, letters, responses to requests, briefs, white
papers, opinions, proposals and other submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any filing required by  _Section_ __ _ 4.7(a) _and
_Section_ __ _ 4.7(b)_ in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (v) consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting, video conference or teleconference with any Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings, video conferences and teleconferences. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties agree that it is Parents ultimate right to devise the
strategy and direct all matters for obtaining clearances, approvals,
and waiting-period expirations under Antitrust Laws, including any filings,
notifications, submissions and communications with or to any Governmental
Entity in connection therewith, and taking into account in good faith any
comments of the Company or its Representatives relating to such strategy.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation law to enable the parties to close the
transaction as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the End
Date, including using reasonable best efforts in connection with (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, whether by consent
decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, to sell, divest, hold separate,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of, commit to behavioral or conduct
remedies, or otherwise encumber, limit or impair or take any other action with
respect to Parents or any of its Affiliates ability to own or operate any
assets, properties, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any assets, properties, businesses or product lines of the
Company or any of its Affiliates; and (ii) avoiding the entry of any permanent
or preliminary injunction or other Order that would make consummation of the
contemplated transaction unlawful or that would otherwise prevent or delay
consummation of the contemplated transaction; _provided_ , that, anything 

 



68

    

 to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, (I) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not enter into or make any consents,
offers, agreements or commitments with respect to the actions contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii) except as and to the extent requested in writing by
Parent, (II) no Party shall be required pursuant to the foregoing to commit to
or effect any action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger, and (III) Parent shall not be required to (x) sell, divest,
exclusively license, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of, or (y) grant any
non-exclusive license, accept any operational restrictions or take or commit
to any actions which restrictions or actions would limit Parents or any of
its Affiliates freedom of action with respect to assets, licenses, product
lines, operations or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on (A) the Company
and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (B) Parent and its Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole), but for purposes of this clause (B), deemed to be the same
size as the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will grant or offer to grant any accommodation
or concession (financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with
seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(g) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that, prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6.1_, it shall not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall, consummate, enter into any agreement providing for, or
authorize, announce, commit to or approve, any investment, acquisition,
divestiture, business combination or other transaction that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay, materially impede or prevent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall submit to the United States Defense Counterintelligence and
Security Agency (" _DCSA_ ") and, to the extent applicable, any other
Governmental Entity that is a cognizant security agency, a notification of the
transfer of ownership contemplated hereby whether or not such notice is
required by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual ("
_NISPOM_ "), and the other applicable national or industrial security
regulations (the " _DCSA Notification_ "). The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in preparing the DCSA Notification and any other
submissions to DCSA required by NISPOM or requested by DCSA as soon as
reasonably practical. The Company and Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain approval from DCSA as promptly as practicable
for the continuation of all necessary U.S. government facility security
clearances.

personnel, properties, Contracts, filings with Governmental Entities and books
and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to
Parent all available information concerning its business as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to permit any inspection or provide other access, or to disclose

such information. All information obtained by or provided to Parent and its
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as "Confidential

Company all available information concerning its business as the Company may

Representatives) access to such information. All information obtained by or
provided to the Company and its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as "Confidential Information" of Parent for purposes of the
Non-Disclosure Agreement.

privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, the
parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with
respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual
understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall
not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its
continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other applicable privilege. All such information that is
entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or any other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such

Amended and Restated 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Company ESPP_ ") so that: (i) any offering period in effect as of the last
payroll date occurring prior to the Closing shall be shortened by setting a

Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with a total target cash
opportunity (i.e _._ , inclusive of an annual base salary or base wage rate
and a target annual cash bonus opportunity, and excluding an equity or equity-
linked compensation opportunity) that is, in each case, not less
favorable than the total target cash opportunity that was provided to such
Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time; and (ii) each Continuing Employee with employee welfare
and retirement benefits (excluding any benefits provided under any defined
benefit pension plan or post-retirement medical plan) that are no less

Parent or Parents Subsidiaries.

(d) All service of the Continuing Employees to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors shall be recognized for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual and
level of benefits with respect to, without limitation, each Parent Plan
(including, but not limited to, any Parent Plan related to vacation and
severance benefits, but excluding any defined benefit pension or post-
retirement medical plan that was not a Company Plan prior to the Effective
Time under which service was credited as of the Effective Time) pursuant
to which service credit is provided to any Parent Employee, in each case in
which any Continuing Employee will participate after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of
benefits. In addition, Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA to: (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements other than preexisting
condition limitations, exclusions or waiting periods that are already in

satisfied or waived as of the Effective Time under the analogous welfare
benefit plan maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) recognize for each Continuing Employee and his or
her spouse, domestic partner and dependents for purposes of applying annual
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Plan any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by the Continuing
Employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner and dependents under an
analogous Company Plan during the plan year of such plan in which occurs the
date on which the Continuing Employee begins participation in such Parent
Plan.

(e) Parent shall or shall cause one (1) of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) to pay to any Continuing
Employee who participates in an annual bonus plan covering the Companys
fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, a prorated annual bonus in
respect of such fiscal year for the period of the fiscal year following the
Effective Time (or if prorated bonuses are not paid to Continuing Employees in
connection with the Closing for the portion of the fiscal year prior to the
Effective Time, then the full fiscal year), with such bonus calculated based
on actual, or, in the event the Closing occurs during or after the Companys
fiscal year 2022, the greater of target and actual, performance through the
end of the fiscal year, based on achievement of such performance metrics as
Parent shall reasonably determine for such period.

 

(f) If requested by Parent not less than ten (10) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall
adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to
terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective
as of the day prior to the Closing Date. In the event that Parent requests
that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to reasonable prior review and comment by
Parent) not later than the day preceding the Closing Date and (ii) following
the Effective Time and as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of
a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of
the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by Parents 401(k)
plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Continuing Employees who are
then actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
inclusive of loans) to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash, in an
amount equal to the full account balance (including any promissory notes)
distributed to such Continuing Employees from the Company 401(k) Plan.

(g) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to create a right in any employee of

Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent or any of its Affiliates, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
and the Continuing Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
amend or modify any compensation or benefit arrangement of Parent, the

7.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will

the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. Each
