Holders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of
such Effective Time Holders to be bound by and comply with, the Escrow
Agreement and all of the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement
relating thereto, including the deposit of the Escrow Amount into escrow and
the indemnification obligations set forth in _Sections 6_ and _10_ hereof.

 

(d) _Holdback Amount; Closing Date Parent Shares_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
respect of the Merger Consideration (as set forth and represented on the
Merger Consideration Certificate, but without regard to whether such Merger
Consideration is contributed to the Escrow Fund or issued in the form of
Closing Date Parent Shares and excluding any Earn-Out Consideration) to be
paid to the Founder, at the Effective Time, Parent shall withhold an amount of
cash equal to fifty-four percent (54%) of such Merger Consideration (the "
_Holdback Amount_ "), which shall be retained by Parent. Interest shall
accrue, and shall be payable annually, on the unpaid balance of such Holdback
Amount at a per annum rate equal to the short-term "applicable Federal rate"
determined under Section 1274(d) of the Code. On each of the first and second
anniversaries of the Effective Time (or, if such anniversary falls on other
than a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day) and the Business
Day immediately prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall pay to Founder an amount equal to thirty-three and one-third
percent (33 1/3%) of the total Holdback Amount, together with all accrued but
unpaid interest thereon through such date. Parents payment obligations set
forth in the preceding sentence are absolute and unconditional and Parent
shall have no right to offset against or withhold or deduct from such payments
any amounts including, without limitation, any amounts any Parent Indemnitee
may be seeking pursuant to  _Section 6_ or _Section 10_ of this Agreement.

(ii) _Closing Date Parent Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Founder shall receive ten percent (10%) of his
portion of the Merger Consideration (as set forth and represented on the
Merger Consideration Certificate, but without regard to whether such Merger
Consideration is contributed to the Escrow Fund or issued in the form of
Closing Date Parent Shares and excluding any Earn-Out Consideration) in the
form of Parent Common Stock in lieu of cash. At the Effective Time,
Parent shall withhold an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Merger
Consideration payable to Founder (as set forth and represented on the Merger
Consideration Certificate, but without regard to whether such Merger
Consideration is contributed to the Escrow Fund or issued in the form of
Closing Date Parent Shares and excluding any Earn-Out Consideration) and, in
lieu of delivering such portion of Founders Merger Consideration to the
Payment Agent, Parent shall retain such portion of Founders Merger
Consideration and deliver to Founder the Closing Date Parent Shares, which
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

 

(e) _Adjustments_. In calculating the consideration payable under this
_Section 1.5_, Parent shall be entitled to rely on the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 2.3_, the Company Closing Certificate and
the Merger Consideration Certificate. If such representations and warranties
or Certificates are not accurate, Parent shall have the right to adjust the
Merger Consideration

 



5  accordingly and, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate merger consideration payable
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the holders of equity
interests in the Company (including the holders of Company Options, RSUs and
Company Warrants) in connection with the Merger contemplated hereby exceed
such consideration payable assuming such representations and warranties
contained in _Section 2.3_, the Company Closing Certificate and the Merger
Consideration Certificate are accurate. In the event that the Company, at any
time or from time to time between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, declares or pays any dividend on Company Common Stock
payable in Company Common Stock or in any right to acquire Company Common
Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock into a greater number of shares of Company Common Stock, or in the
event the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares
of Company Common Stock, or a record date with respect to any of the
foregoing shall occur during such period, then the amounts payable in respect
of shares of Outstanding Capital Stock pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and the
amounts payable in respect of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
Outstanding In-the-Money Options, RSUs, and Outstanding Warrants pursuant to
_Section 1.6_ shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

(f) _Earn-Out Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each holder of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have the right to receive his,
her or its Post-Closing Pro Rata Share of the Earn-Out Consideration, if any,
as and when payable, as calculated and determined in the manner set forth in
_Exhibit E_.

 

1.6 Treatment of Company Options, Company Warrants and Restricted Stock Units.

 

(a) _Stock Options_. Subject to _Sections 1.5(c)_ , _1.5(d)_ , _1.5(e)_ ,
_1.8(h) 1.9_ and _1.11_ , at the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, an amount in cash equal to: (A) the product of (1)
the Per Share Amount _multiplied by_ (2) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock purchasable under such Company Option; _minus_ (B) the
product of (1) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option _multiplied by_ (2) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock purchasable under such Company Option (it being
understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of a share of
Company Common Stock subject to any Company Option that is unexercised and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time exceeds the Per
Share Amount (an " _Underwater Option_ "), then the amount payable hereunder
with respect to such Company Option shall be zero) (each Company Option that
is unexercised and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(after giving effect to any exercises of Company Options prior to
the Effective Time), other than any Underwater Option, is referred to in this
Agreement as an " _Outstanding In-the-Money Option_ ")). Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under
the Company Stock Plan or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 1.6(a)_ and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, each
holder of an Outstanding In-the-Money Option cancelled as provided in this 
_Section 1.6(a)_ shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the consideration specified in this _Section 1.6(a)_ and
_Section 1.11_, without interest (except as otherwise set forth herein or
therein).

(b) _Warrants_. Prior to the Closing, to the extent not already provided for
in connection with such Company Warrants, the Company shall cause to be
amended each agreement evidencing Company Warrants to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Warrant_ ") that is outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement (each such Company Warrant being referred to herein as
an " _Outstanding Warrant_ "; and each such amendment being referred to herein
as a " _Warrant Surrender_

 



6   _Agreement_ ") to provide that each such Company Warrant shall be
cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the
cancellation thereof be converted into the right to receive, subject to
_Sections 1.5(c)_ , _1.5(d)_ , _1.5(e)_ , _1.8(h) 1.9_ and _1.11_ , an amount
in cash equal to: (A) the product of (1) the Per Share Amount _multiplied by_
(2) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under
such Company Warrant immediately prior to such cancellation, termination and
extinguishment; _minus_ (B) the product of (1) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Company Warrant _multiplied by_ (2) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock purchasable under such
Company Warrant immediately prior to such cancellation, termination and
extinguishment (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under any Company
Warrant exceeds the Per Share Amount, the amount payable hereunder with
respect to such Company Warrant shall be zero).

 

(c) _Warrant Surrender Agreement_. Each Warrant Surrender Agreement shall be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and the Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of each Warrant Surrender Agreement as
promptly as practicable following its execution. The Company shall take all
actions that may be necessary to ensure each holder of an Outstanding
Warrant cancelled as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
specified in _Section 1.6(b)_ and _Section 1.11_, without interest (except
as otherwise set forth herein or therein).

(d) _RSUs_. Subject to _Sections 1.5(c)_ , _1.5(d)_ , _1.5(e)_ ,  _1.8(h)
1.9_ and _1.11,_ prior to the Effective Time, the Companys board of directors
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding award of restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ") with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall
vest in full and be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the Per Share Amount _multiplied by_ (B) the aggregate number of shares
subject to such holders outstanding award(s) of RSUs.

 

(e) _Payment_. Parent: (i) shall cause to be paid through the payroll services
of the Company or Parent to each holder of an Outstanding In-the-Money Option
or RSU (other than Outstanding In-the-Money Options and RSUs with respect to
which the Company has no Tax withholding obligations (" _Non-Employee Equity
Award_ ")), the consideration specified in  _Section 1.6 and_, to the extent
applicable, _Section 1.9(c)(i)_ or _(ii)_ and _Section 1.11_, without
interest, _less_ applicable withholding Taxes; and (ii) shall cause to be paid
by the Payment Agent (as defined in _Section 1.8(a)_): (A) to each holder of
a Non-Employee Equity Award the consideration specified in _Section 1.6_,
without interest, and (B) to each holder of an Outstanding Warrant that
delivers a duly executed Warrant Surrender Agreement to Parent, the
consideration specified in _Section 1.6(b)_, without interest. Any payments
required to be made to holders of Outstanding In-the-Money Options or RSUs
pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ shall be paid as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time and any payments required to be made pursuant to
_Section 1.9(c)(i)_ or _(ii)_ or _Section 1.11_ (subject to the terms
set forth in _Exhibit E_ ), if applicable, shall be made as promptly as
practicable following the final determination of the amounts due to the
Effective Time Holders under those provisions. The parties intend that any
deferred payments under this Agreement with respect to any Outstanding In-
the-Money Option or RSU shall be governed by the provisions of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A), and the provisions of this Agreement
shall be interpreted and applied consistently with such intent.

(f) _Earn-Out Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each holder of Outstanding In-the-Money Options, Outstanding Warrants or RSUs
shall have the right to receive his, her or its Post-Closing Pro Rata Share of
the Earn-Out Consideration, if any, as and when payable, as calculated and
determined in the manner set forth in  _Exhibit E_.

 



7 1.7 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) _Effect on Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder
who is entitled to exercise, has exercised and has properly perfected a demand
for dissenters rights with respect to such holders shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and as of the Closing has
not failed to perfect, has not effectively withdrawn and has not lost such
holders dissenters rights under the WBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into or exchangeable for the applicable Merger
Consideration, but shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the
WBCA. Parent shall be entitled to retain any Merger Consideration not paid on
account of such Dissenting Shares pending resolution of the claims of
such holders, and the Effective Time Holders shall not be entitled to any
portion of such retained Merger Consideration.

(b) _Loss of Dissenting Share Status_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_Section 1.7(a)_, if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
exercise and who exercises dissenters rights with respect to such holders
shares under the WBCA shall effectively withdraw or lose (through the failure
to perfect or otherwise) such holders dissenters right under the WBCA, then
as of the Closing or the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be deemed to
have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon.

 

(c) _Notice of Dissenting Shares_. The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any exercise of dissenters rights with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of any such exercise
of dissenters rights, and any other instruments or notices served or
otherwise delivered pursuant to the WBCA and received by the Company; and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such exercise of dissenters rights, subject to the terms of _Section
10.7_. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make
any payment with respect to any demands for dissenters rights with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock or offer to settle any such demands. Each
holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the WBCA,
becomes entitled to payment of the value of the Dissenting Shares will receive
payment therefor but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to such provisions. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration that would otherwise have been payable with respect to
Dissenting Shares if such Shares were not Dissenting Shares will be retained
by Parent.

 

1.8 Exchange of Certificates and Payment.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. shall act as payment agent in
the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). On or immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent for the benefit of the Non-
Dissenting Shareholders and the holders of Non-Employee Equity Awards and
Outstanding Warrants, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration
(excluding the Escrow Amount (which shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent),
Holdback Amount, the amount issued to Founder in the form of Closing Date
Parent Shares pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ and any Earn-Out Consideration).
The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will be instructed to invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent and the Payment
Fund shall be held in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
terms of the Payment Agent Agreement. Any interest or other income resulting
from the investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid
to, Parent. The Company shall deliver Form W-9s for all holders of Non-
Employee Equity Awards to the Payment Agent.

 



8 (b) _Letter of Transmittal_. To the extent not previously delivered, the
Payment Agent shall as soon as possible following the Effective Time (but in
no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), mail to each Person who
is a record holder of Outstanding Capital Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the exchange of Company Stock Certificates
for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent of a Company
Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as described in
_Section 1.8(e)_), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and
such other documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably request,
the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall, subject to _Section
1.8(h)_, if applicable, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_ or _Section 1.5(d)_, and the
Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. From
and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate which prior to
the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any,
payable with respect to such shares, and the holder of each such Company Stock
Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby except as provided in this
Agreement.

(c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to _Section 1.5_ is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Company
Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment (i)
that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (ii) that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares
of Outstanding Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented
to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided
for in _Section 1.5_. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificate
representing shares of Outstanding Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and indemnification agreement
in form acceptable to Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliated
party with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

 

(f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to Effective Time Holders as of the date that is one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of this Agreement shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and Effective Time Holders who have not theretofore
received their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 1.5_ and _1.6_ , shall thereafter look only to
Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements).

 



9 (g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any Effective Time
Holder or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar
applicable Legal Requirement. Any Merger Consideration or other amounts
remaining unclaimed by Effective Time Holders three (3) years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Body) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become
the property of Parent free and clear of any Encumbrance.

 

(h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent, the
Company, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (including
all amounts payable from funds contributed to the Escrow Fund in accordance
with _Section 1.5(c)_) such amounts as Parent determines in good faith are
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

1.9 Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration.

 

(a) _Calculation_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
(i) prepare or cause to be prepared in accordance with GAAP an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Parent Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement (the "
_Parent Closing Date Schedule_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the
Surviving Corporations calculation of (A) the Closing Cash Amount, (B) the
Closing Current Asset Amount, and (C) the Closing Deductions ((A), (B) and
(C), collectively, the " _Closing Adjustments_ ") and (ii) deliver to the
Securityholders Agent the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing
Date Schedule.

 

(b) _Review/Disputes_.

 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide
the Securityholders Agent and any accountants or advisors retained by the
Securityholders Agent with reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the relevant books and records of the Surviving Corporation used by the
Surviving Corporation in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably relevant
to, the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing Date Schedule. If
the Securityholders Agent disputes the calculation of one or more of the
Closing Adjustments set forth in the Parent Closing Balance Sheet or the
Parent Closing Date Schedule, then the Securityholders Agent shall deliver a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Surviving Corporation at any
time during the thirty (30) day period commencing upon receipt by the
Securityholders Agent of the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent
Closing Date Schedule (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set
forth the basis for the dispute of any such calculation in reasonable detail.

(ii) If the Securityholders Agent does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the
Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Surviving Corporations calculation of the Closing Adjustments set forth in
the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and the Parent Closing Date Schedule shall be
deemed final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders Agent and the Effective Time Holders for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 



10 (iii) If the Securityholders Agent delivers a Dispute Notice to
the Surviving Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
the Securityholders Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to reach agreement on the
disputed portion of the Closing Adjustments within the thirty (30) day period
commencing upon receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the Dispute Notice. If
the Securityholders Agent and the Surviving Corporation are unable to reach
agreement on the disputed portion of the Closing Adjustments within such
thirty (30) day period, then either the Surviving Corporation or the
Securityholders Agent may submit the unresolved objections to a national
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to both the Surviving Corporation and
the Securityholders Agent (such firm, and any successor thereto, being
referred to herein as the " _Accounting Firm_ "), and such Accounting Firm
shall be directed by the Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders Agent
to resolve the unresolved objections in accordance with the immediately
following sentence. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by
the Accounting Firm: (A) each of the Surviving Corporation and
the Securityholders Agent shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with
the Accounting Firm to provide their views as to any disputed issues with
respect to the calculation of the disputed portion of the Closing Adjustments,
(B) the Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing Adjustments in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event, within sixty (60) days of its engagement) and upon reaching such
determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the " _Expert
Calculations_ ") to the Securityholders Agent and the Surviving Corporation
and (C) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Closing
Adjustments shall be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Securityholders Agent and the Effective Time Holders for all purposes of
this Agreement, absent manifest error. In calculating the Closing Adjustments,
the Accounting Firm (x) shall be limited to addressing the particular
disputes referred to in the Dispute Notice and (y) for each component of the
Closing Adjustments, such calculation shall, with respect to any disputed
item, be no greater than the higher amount calculated by the Securityholders
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, and no less than the lower amount
calculated by the Securityholders Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences,
if any, between the Closing Adjustments reflected therein and the Closing
Adjustments set forth in the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and Parent Closing
Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such determination or,
if the Accounting Firm determines that neither party could be fairly found to
be the prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be borne equally by
the Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders Agent.

(c) _Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments_.

 

(i) If (A) the Purchase Price, calculated based on the Closing Adjustments as
finally determined in accordance with _Section 1.9(b)_, is less than (B) the
Purchase Price set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate (the positive
amount of such difference, the " _Closing Adjustments Shortfall_ "), then
Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall, no later than two (2) Business
Days after such determination, deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Working Capital
Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Closing Adjustments Shortfall by
delivery of immediately available funds to Parent and to pay the remaining
portion of the Working Capital Escrow Fund (if any) to the Effective Time
Holders on a Pro Rata Share basis (with the portion allocable to holders of
Outstanding In-the-Money Options and RSUs (other than Non-Employee Equity
Awards) to be paid in a manner consistent with _Section 1.6(e))_. If the
Closing Adjustment Shortfall exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Fund, then
Parent shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund in the amount of such shortfall, and Parent and the Securityholders
Agent shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
an amount in cash equal to such shortfall.

 



11 (ii) If (A) the Purchase Price, calculated based on the Closing Adjustments
as finally determined in accordance with _Section 1.9(b)_, is greater than
(B) the Purchase Price set forth in the Merger Consideration Certificate (such
amount, the " _Parent Underpayment_ "), then (I) Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, no later than two (2) Business Days after such
determination (or, with respect to any Effective Time Holder that has not
exchanged such Effective Time Holders Company Stock Certificates pursuant to
_Section 1.8_, then upon such exchange by such Effective Time Holder), pay
directly to (or fund the Payment Agent and cause the Payment Agent to pay to)
each Effective Time Holder by delivery of immediately available funds such
Effective Time Holders Post-Closing Pro Rata Share of the Parent Underpayment
(provided that the portion allocable to holders of Outstanding In-the-Money
Options and RSUs (other than Non-Employee Equity Awards) will be paid in a
manner consistent with _Section 1.6(e))_, and (II) Parent and the
Securityholders Agent shall, no later than two (2) Business Days after such
determination, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Working Capital Escrow Fund to
the Effective Time Holders on a Pro Rata Share basis (with the portion
allocable to holders of Outstanding In-the-Money Options and RSUs (other than
Non-Employee Equity Awards) to be paid in a manner consistent with _Section
1.6(e))_.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 1.9_ shall limit any rights of any Indemnitee
as set forth in _Sections 6_ or _10_.

1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights
and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

1.11 Earn-Out. In addition to the payments contemplated by _Sections 1.5_ and
_1.6_ , the Effective Time Holders shall have the right to receive as
additional Purchase Price cash proceeds up to an aggregate amount of
$350,000,000, based upon 2015 Adjusted EBITDA, calculated in accordance with
_Exhibit E_ , and Parent shall pay to such Persons additional cash proceeds
as calculated and determined in the manner set forth in _Exhibit E_. Such
right to receive additional Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 1.11_
shall not be represented by a certificate or other instrument, shall not
represent an ownership interest in Parent or the Surviving Corporation and
shall not entitle the Effective Time Holders to any rights common to any
holder of any equity security of Parent.

 

2\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Letter prepared by the Company and

with the appropriate regulatory authorities.

(g) _Absence of Certain Retiree Liabilities_. No Acquired Company Employee
Plan provides (except at no cost to any Acquired Company), or reflects or
represents any Liability of any Acquired Company to provide, retiree life
insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare benefits
to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by applicable Legal
Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any
Acquired Company, no Acquired Company has ever represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Acquired Company employee
(either individually or to Acquired Company employees as a group) or any other

pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, by any Person with
respect to any Acquired Company Employee Plan.

 

(i) _No Conflict_. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will or may (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) constitute an
event under any Acquired Company Employee Plan, trust or loan that will or
may result (either alone or in connection with any other circumstance or
event) in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits (through a grantor trust or otherwise) with
respect to any Acquired Company employee; or (ii) create or otherwise result
in any Liability with respect to any Acquired Company Employee Plan. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable by an
Acquired Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby

or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Body with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for any Acquired Company employee (other than routine payments to
be made in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice).
Each Acquired Company Employee Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable Internal
Revenue Service determination letter with respect to such qualification and
the Tax-exempt status of its related trust, and, to the Knowledge of the

in liability to any Acquired Company in respect of such qualified status.
No Acquired Company Employee Plan is intended to meet the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(k) _Title IV of ERISA_. No Acquired Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate of any
Acquired Company, has ever maintained, been a participating employer,

policy, long-term disability policy, safety, retaliation, immigration
or discrimination matter involving any Acquired Company employee, including
charges of unfair labor practices or harassment complaints.

Acquired Company Employee Plans or the Acquired Companies, or the Acquired

Company Employee Plans with respect to the operation of such Acquired Company
Employee Plans (other than routine, uncontested benefit claims) or asserting

(r) agree or commit to take any of the actions described in clauses "(a)"
through "(q)" above.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Acquired Company may take any action
described in: (i) clauses "(a)" through "(q)" above if: (A) Parent gives its
prior written consent to the taking of such action by the Acquired Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); or
(B) such action is expressly required to be taken by this Agreement; and (ii)
_Schedule 4.2_.

4.3 Notification. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent in writing of any of the Acquired Companies obtaining Knowledge
of: (i) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs or arises after
the date of this Agreement and that would cause or

 



39  constitute a breach of or an inaccuracy in any material respect in any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement if such
representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence,
existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, such
that the condition in _Section 7.1_ would not be satisfied; (iii) any breach
of any covenant or obligation of the Company such that the condition in
_Section 7.2_ would not be satisfied; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7_ impossible or unlikely. No notification under this
_Section 4.3_ shall be required with respect to matters consented to in
writing by Parent pursuant to the last paragraph of _Section 4.2_ or the
actual taking of actions contemplated by _Schedule 4.2_.

4.4 No Negotiation. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and
the Company shall not authorize or permit, any of the Acquired Companies or
any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies to (a) knowingly initiate
or solicit, encourage or facilitate the initiation or submission of, any
expression of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or Entity
(other than Parent) relating to an Acquisition Transaction; or (b) participate
or engage in any discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement with,
or provide any information to, any Person or Entity relating to or
in connection with an Acquisition Transaction. The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with a reasonable description of any expression of interest,
inquiry, proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition Transaction that is
received by the Company or any of its Representatives from any Person (other
than Parent) during the Pre-Closing Period (it being understood that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide Parent with a description of any
unsolicited expression of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer relating to an
Acquisition Transaction received from a third party after the date hereof to
the extent prohibited by an applicable non-disclosure agreement that was in
place with such third party as of September 29, 2014). 

4.5 Termination of Certain Benefit Plans. The Company shall take (or cause to
be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date: (a) any Acquired
Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _401(k) Plans_ "); and (b)
any other Acquired Company Employee Plan requested by Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, unless, in the case of clauses "(a)"
and "(b)", Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and
maintain any such 401(k) Plans by providing the Company with written notice of
such election (an " _Election Notice_ ") at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. Unless Parent provides an Election Notice to the
Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior to the Closing Date,
evidence that the Companys board of directors has validly adopted resolutions
to terminate the 401(k) Plans and other Acquired Company Employee Plans (the
form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective no later than the date immediately preceding
the Closing Date. In the event that the distributions of assets from the
trust of a 401(k) Plan which is terminated is reasonably anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed
upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or
upon any Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Parent prior to the Effective Time.

 

4.6 Termination/Amendment of Agreements and Release of Encumbrances. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) cause the
agreements identified in _Schedule 4.6(a)_ to be terminated effective as of
the Effective Time; (b) cause the agreements identified in _Schedule 4.6(b)_
to be amended effective as of the Effective Time in the manner set forth on
_Schedule 4.6_; and (c) secure the termination and release of any and all
Encumbrances upon the assets or properties of the Acquired Companies; in each
case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

 



40 4.7 Communications with Employees. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly develop and agree on a
communications plan with respect to Acquired Company Service Providers ("
_Communications Plan_ ") regarding post-Closing employment matters with Parent
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent, including post-Closing employee
benefit plans and compensation (collectively, " _Post-Closing Employment
Matters_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall only communicate
with Acquired Company Service Providers regarding Post-Closing Employment
Matters in a manner that is materially consistent with the Communications
Plan.

4.8 Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide to Parent, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to provide, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
provide, on a timely basis, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing, including (i) furnishing Parent the Required
Information, (ii) furnishing Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following Parents request, with such pertinent and customary information
(other than the Required Information, which is covered by clause (i) above),
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to consummate the arrangement and borrowings of loans and offerings of
debt securities contemplated by the Financing, including all documentation and
other information required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-
money laundering rules and regulations (including the Patriot Act), (iii)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers, managers, bookrunners,
agents or in similar capacities for, and prospective lenders and Parents of
debt securities to be offered in, the Financing and management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, and reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Parent and their Financing Sources, in each case in connection with
the Financing, including by consenting to the use of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection therewith, (iv) assisting with the
timely preparation of materials for rating agency and lender presentations,
offering documents, bank information memoranda, private placement memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing
and cooperating in the preparation of pro forma financial information for the
Merger, (v) obtaining accountants comfort letters, consents and legal
opinions reasonably requested by Parent, (vi) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to
permit the consummation of the Financing and the execution and delivery of the
documents related to the Financing, (vii) in connection with the Financing or
any bridge loan or securities offering in connection therewith, providing
customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
prospective lenders and containing a representation that the public side
versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
securities, (viii) cooperating reasonably with the due diligence of the
Financing Sources, to the extent customary and reasonable and to the extent
not unreasonably interfering with the business of the Company, and using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the participation of its
accountants in a reasonable number of accounting due diligence sessions, (ix)
co-operating with Parent in Parents efforts to obtain corporate, index, debt
securities and/or facilities ratings and (x) facilitating the granting or
pledging of collateral under Parents existing or future credit facilities
including assisting Parent in obtaining surveys, estoppels and memoranda of
lease from landlords, SNDAs and title insurance (including delivering GAP
indemnities and owners affidavits to the title company) as reasonably
requested by Parent and its lenders; _provided, however_ , that, no obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate,
document or instrument (other than the authorization letters referred to
above) shall be effective until the Closing and, none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or
other fee or incur any other Liability in connection with the Financing prior
to the Closing. If the Closing does not occur, Parent shall, within thirty
(30) days following written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of

 



41  its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 4.8_. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, supplement any information supplied in writing by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Parent on a
reasonably current basis to ensure that such information is Compliant.

Company to the same extent such persons are indemnified by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Companys Charter Documents, any
applicable employment agreements or indemnification agreements or under
applicable Legal Requirements for acts or omissions which occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time. The provisions with respect to indemnification
and exculpation contained in the Surviving Companys Articles of
Incorporation and bylaws shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years in any manner that would materially adversely
affect the rights of the past and present officers and directors of the
Company when compared to such provisions in the Companys Articles of
Incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the date hereof.

 



43 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") for the
Acquired Companies directors and officers in a form mutually acceptable to
the Company and Parent, which shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable
to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,

and present officers and directors of the Company under this _Section 5.4_
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract,
applicable Legal Requirements or otherwise.

 

6\. TAX MATTERS

 

6.1 Liability for Taxes.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. Subject to _Section 10.3(e)(ii)_, from and after the
Effective Time, each Effective Time Holder shall, severally and not jointly,
hold harmless and indemnify each of the Parent Indemnitees from and against
such Effective Time Holders Indemnity Pro Rata Share of any Damages that are
directly or indirectly suffered or incurred at any time by any of the Parent
Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise directly
or indirectly become subject at any time (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any Third Party Claim) and that arise directly
or indirectly from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected
with: (i) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company, or for which any Acquired
Company may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a
Company Group (including Taxes for which any Acquired Company may be liable
pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state,
local or foreign law as a result of having been a member of a Company Group
and any Taxes resulting from any Acquired Company ceasing to be a member of
any Company Group), and (ii) Taxes imposed on any Acquired Company, or for
which any Acquired Company may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or
period that ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that no Effective Time Holder shall be
liable for any liability for Taxes to the extent such Tax Liability is taken
into account as a liability for current Taxes payable in computing the Closing
Adjustments; and _provided further_ that the foregoing indemnification shall
not apply to any Taxes arising as a result of any (1) action taken outside
the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the Effective Time
(other than transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement), or (2)
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



44 (b) For purposes of paragraph (a), whenever it is necessary to determine the
liability for Taxes of any Acquired Company for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes of an Acquired Company for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which
began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of an Acquired Company for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of any
Acquired Company were closed at the close of the Closing Date,  _provided,
however_ , that exemptions, allowances, deductions or Taxes that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as property Taxes and depreciation
deductions, shall be apportioned between such two (2) taxable years or periods
on a daily basis.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (a), whenever it is necessary to determine the
liability for Taxes of a United States shareholder (within the meaning of
Section 951(b) of the Code) of a controlled foreign corporation (within the
meaning of Section 957 of the Code) attributable to amounts included in the
income of such United States shareholder under Section 951 of the Code for
the taxable year or period of such controlled foreign corporation that begins
on or before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of liability
for any such Taxes shall be made by assuming that the taxable year or period
of the controlled foreign corporation consisted of two taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other of
which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and
relevant items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the controlled
foreign corporation shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
controlled foreign corporation were closed at the close of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Subpart F income (within the meaning of Section
952 of the Code) of the controlled foreign corporation shall be determined
without regard to Section 952(c) of the Code.

6.2 Tax Returns.

 

(a) The Acquired Companies shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns (including any
carryback or refund claims) that are permitted or required to be filed by or
with respect to each Acquired Company on or before the Closing Date, and shall
remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Parent shall file or
cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to
each Acquired Company after the Closing Date and Parent shall remit or cause
to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(b) All Tax Returns that the Acquired Companies are required to file or cause
to be filed in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ shall be prepared and
filed in a manner consistent in all material respects with past practice and,
on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method
adopted that is materially inconsistent with positions taken, elections made
or methods used in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods
(including positions, elections or methods that would have the effect of
deferring any material amount of income to periods ending after the Closing
Date or accelerating any material amount of deductions to periods beginning
before the Closing Date). With respect to any Tax Return to be filed by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ that relates to any taxable year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, Parent, not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into
account extensions (or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date),
shall provide the Securityholders Agent with a draft copy of such Tax Return
for review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
(provided that the Securityholders Agent shall not withhold consent with
respect to any positions consistent with any Tax refund or credit taken into
account as an asset or similar item in computing the Closing Adjustment).
Parent shall make any revisions to such Tax Return that relate to a taxable
year or period ending on or before the Closing Date as are reasonably
requested by the Securityholders Agent.

 



45 (c) Any Tax deductions of the Company attributable to payments of compensation
(including with respect to any payments to holders of Outstanding In-the-
Money Options or RSUs), Company Transaction Expenses or repayment of any
Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies, in each case, to the extent such Tax
deductions arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall, to the maximum extent permitted under Legal Requirements, be
treated as allocable to the taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the
Closing Date.

 

(d) Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Effective Time Holders,
based on each Effective Time Holders Indemnity Pro Rata Share basis
(provided that any such reimbursement shall be first applied against the
Indemnity Escrow Fund), for Taxes for which the Effective Time Holders are
liable pursuant to _Section 6.1_ but which are remitted or caused to
be remitted by Parent pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.2_, upon
written request setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed to
Parent.

 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or
otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of any Acquired Company with
respect to any Tax period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date without
the prior written consent of the Securityholders Agent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

6.3 Contest Provisions.

 

(a) Parent shall notify Securityholders Agent in writing upon receipt by
Parent, any of its Affiliates or, after the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period of an
Acquired Company ending on or before the Closing Date or to any Straddle
Period of an Acquired Company; _provided_ , that failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect Parents right to indemnification under this
Agreement unless such failure materially prejudices the rights of the
Securityholders Agent pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

(b) Securityholders Agent shall have the sole right to represent any
Acquired Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to a Tax liability for which the Effective Time Holders
would be required to indemnify Parent Indemnitees pursuant to Section 6.1 and
that relates to a taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date, and to employ counsel of Securityholders Agents choice at
Securityholders Agents expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Securityholders Agent shall have no right to represent any Acquired
Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
unless (1) Securityholders Agent shall have first notified Parent in writing
of Securityholders Agents intention to do so and of the identity of
counsel, if any, chosen by Securityholders Agent in connection therewith, and
(2) Securityholders Agent shall have agreed with Parent that, as between
Parent and the Effective Time Holders, the Effective Time Holders shall be
liable for any Damages relating to Taxes that result from such audit or
proceeding, but solely to the extent such Damages would otherwise be subject
to indemnification by the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and its representatives shall be
permitted, at Parents expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such
audit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Securityholders Agent
shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could adversely affect
the liability for Taxes of any Parent Indemnitee or any Acquired Company in
any material respect for any period after the Closing Date, unless
Securityholders Agent shall have agreed that the Effective Time Holders will
indemnify each Parent Indemnitee against the effects of any such settlement
(other than the reduction of asset basis

 



46  or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any amortization or depreciation
periods, the denial of amortization or depreciation deductions, or the
reduction of loss or credit carryforwards or other Tax attributes), without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

(c) Parent shall have the sole right to represent each Acquired Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax liabilities other than those for which Securityholders Agent has
exercised such right pursuant to paragraph (b) of this _Section 6.3_ and to
employ counsel of Parents choice at Parents expense. To the extent such
audit or proceeding could result in any material indemnification obligation of
the Effective Time Holders under this Agreement, Parent shall keep
Securityholders Agent reasonably informed regarding the status of such audit
or proceeding. With respect to any such period that ends on or prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively
or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could
adversely affect any indemnification obligation of the Effective Time Holders
hereunder in any material respect without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. 

(d) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Parent any obligation to
defend any Acquired Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding. Any proceeding with respect to which Securityholders Agent does
not assume control in accordance with this _Section 6.3_ (including any
Straddle Period) may be settled or compromised in the discretion of Parent,
and any such settlement or compromise shall not affect (and shall not be
determinative of) any Parent Indemnitees right to indemnification under this
Agreement.

Securityholders Agent and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to):

(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to sales, transfer and similar Taxes;

(b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section
6.2_;

 

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Acquired Company;

(d) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies; and

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period; provided, that Parent shall only be
obligated to furnish copies of such correspondence to Securityholders Agent
to the extent such audit or information request relates to Taxes for which
the Effective Time Holders may be liable under the terms of this Agreement.

 

6.5 Termination of Tax Sharing Arrangements. Any Tax Sharing Arrangement
entered into by any Acquired Company, other than this Agreement, shall be
terminated as to each Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing, and after
the Closing no Acquired Company shall have any Liability thereunder.

 



47 6.6 Survival, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including  _Section 10_), the obligations of the parties set forth in this
_Section 6_ shall survive the Effective Time until the date that is sixty
(60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations
(including any extensions thereof); _provided, however_ , that if, at any
time on or prior to the expiration date referred to in this sentence, any
Parent Indemnitee delivers to the Securityholders Agent a written notice
asserting a claim for recovery under this _Section 6_ based on such alleged
breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive until such time
as such claim is fully and finally resolved. No claim made pursuant to this
_Section 6_ shall be subject to the limitations in _Section 10.3_. The
obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section 6_ shall not be subject
to any limitation under _Section 10.3_.

 

6.7 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by Parent or any Acquired
Company and any amounts credited against Taxes payable to which Parent or any
Acquired Company becomes entitled, that relate to Taxes of any Acquired
Company for a Tax year or period ending on or before the Closing Date and the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
and which are not included as an asset in computing the Closing Adjustments
shall be for the account of the Effective Time Holders, and Parent shall pay
over to the Securityholders Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders)
any such refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof or actual reduction of Tax payable. Parent shall cooperate
with Securityholders Agent, and take reasonable steps requested by
Securityholders Agent, to obtain any such refund or credit (including by
timely preparing applicable carryback claims). For purposes of this Agreement,
whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for (or any refund of or
amount credited with respect to) Taxes of any Acquired Company for a Straddle
Period, the principles of _Section 6.1(b)_ will apply. For the avoidance of
doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies) shall
be entitled to any refund of (or amount credited against) Taxes taken into
account as an asset or similar item in computing the Closing Adjustments, and
the Securityholders Agent shall cooperate with Parent, and take reasonable
steps requested by Parent, to obtain any such refund or credit.

6.8 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, real estate excise, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
paid one-half by Parent and one-half by the Securityholders Agent (on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders) when due, and the party required by Law
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable Law, Parent and Securityholders Agent will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

of the Holder Indemnitees, on the other hand, exceeds $4,850,000 in the
aggregate (the " _Basket Amount_ "). If the total amount of such Damages
exceeds the Basket Amount, then the Parent Indemnitees or Holder Indemnitees,
as applicable, shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated
and reimbursed for the entire amount of such Damages, and not merely the

limit the indemnification or other obligations of any Effective Time Holder):
(A) in the event of fraud with respect to another party hereto or an
Indemnified Party hereunder; (B) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
Specified Representations; or (C) to any of the matters to which _Section 6_
applies. Each Effective Time Holder shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold 

 



55  harmless each Parent Indemnitee from and against such Effective Time
Holders Indemnity Pro Rata Share of any Damages arising directly or
indirectly from, resulting from, or directly or indirectly related to (W)
fraud with respect to another party hereto or an Indemnified Party hereunder
(whether on the part of any Effective Time Holder, any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company); (X) inaccuracies in or breaches of
any of the Specified Representations; (Y) any of the matters to which _Section
6_ applies or (Z) any of the matters referred to in _Sections 10.2(a)(ii)_ ,
_(iv)_ , and _(v)_ , to the extent that the Indemnity Escrow Fund is not
available to satisfy all or any portion of any claim relating thereto.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the total amount of
indemnification payments that each Effective Time Holder can be required to
make to the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 6_ or _Section 10.2_
(in excess of the amount, if any, that was withheld from such Effective Time
Holder as a contribution to the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
_Section 1.5(c)_, and paid to Parent or any other Parent Indemnitee out of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund) shall be limited to the aggregate Merger
Consideration such Effective Time Holder actually received pursuant to
_Sections 1.5_ and _1.6_. The total amount of indemnification payments that
Parent can be required to make to the Holder Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
10.2_ shall be limited to the Purchase Price.

(f) _Insurance Recoveries_. In the event that an insurance recovery is
actually received by any Indemnitee from a third party with respect to any
Damages for which such Indemnitee has been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of such recovery not to exceed the
applicable indemnification payment paid by the Indemnifying Party (net of
costs and expenses incurred in recovering such amounts, including any
increases in premium (whether retroactive or prospective)) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnifying Party.

(g) _Effect of Closing Adjustments_. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent
Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification for any Liability solely
to the extent such Liability is taken into account in determining the final
Purchase Price under _Section 1.9_.

 

10.4 No Contribution. With respect to the Surviving Corporation and the
Acquired Companies, each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise
or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against
the Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which such Effective Time
Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreement, document or instrument delivered to Parent in connection
with this Agreement. Effective as of the Closing, the Securityholders Agent,
on behalf of itself and each Effective Time Holder, and each Effective Time
Holder expressly waives and releases any and all rights of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Acquired Company.

 

10.5 Claim Procedures. Any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10_
(and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any claim based upon fraud with
respect to a party hereto or an Indemnified Party hereunder) shall be brought
and resolved exclusively as follows:

 

(a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to indemnification under _Section 6.6_ or this
_Section 10_ or for which it is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary
remedy relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a
" _Claim Notice_ ") to the Securityholders Agent,

 



56  subject to the survival periods set forth in _Section 6_ or _Section
10.1_. Each Claim Notice shall: (i) contain a brief description of the facts
and circumstances supporting the Indemnitees claim; and (ii) if practicable,
contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which
the Indemnitee might be entitled (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
applicable Indemnitee shall provide a good faith estimate of the amount to
which the Indemnitee might be entitled prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 10.1_).

 

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall be entitled under  _Section 6_
or this _Section 10_ shall be determined (i) by the written agreement between
the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent or Parent, as applicable, (ii)
by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii)
by any other means to which the Indemnitee and the Securityholders Agent or
Parent, as applicable, shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be
deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. So long as the amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund exceeds the
aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification that have been asserted
but not resolved, the Parent Indemnitees shall seek to recover amounts in
respect of such claims from the Indemnity Escrow Fund prior to seeking to
recover amounts in respect of such claims directly from any Effective Time
Holder.

 

10.6 Release From Escrow.

 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days after the Expiration Date, Parent will
notify the Securityholders Agent in writing of the amount, if any, in
addition to any amounts that have previously been retained or reserved that
Parent determines in good faith to be necessary to satisfy all claims for
indemnification that have been asserted in accordance with  _Section 10.5_,
but not resolved on or prior to 11:59 p.m. (Central time) on the Expiration
Date (each such claim a " _Continuing Claim_ " and such amount, together with
any amounts that have previously been retained or reserved, the " _Retained
Escrow Amount_ "). Subject to _Section 10.6(c)_ , within ten (10) Business
Days following the Expiration Date, Parent and the Securityholders Agent
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund an
amount in the aggregate equal to (i) the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund as of the Expiration Date (as reduced from time to time pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement) _minus_ (ii) the Retained Escrow Amount, for
distribution to each Effective Time Holder in accordance with such Effective
Time Holders Indemnity Pro Rata Share, it being acknowledged and agreed that
a portion of such aggregate amount sufficient to pay holders of Outstanding
In-the-Money Options or RSUs (other than Non-Employee Equity Awards) shall be
released to the Company (and, promptly thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Company to pay through the payroll services of the Company to each such
holder its Indemnity Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Release Amount), and the
remaining portion of such aggregate amount shall be released to the Payment
Agent for distribution to the other Effective Time Holders.

(b) Upon the full and final resolution of any Continuing Claims, all remaining
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Effective Time
Holders in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 10.6(a)_.

 

(c) With respect to any amount to be released from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this _Section 10.6(c)_ or the
Escrow Agreement: (i) if any former holder of Outstanding Capital Stock has
not executed and delivered a properly completed Letter of Transmittal and
either surrendered such Effective Time Holders Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with _Section 1.8(b)_ or executed an affidavit of lost certificate
and complied with _Section 1.8(e)_ (collectively, the " _Payment Conditions_
") prior to the delivery to the Escrow Agent of the applicable joint written
instructions, then any amount that would otherwise be released to such
Effective

 



57  Time Holder shall be held by the Payment Agent, without interest, until such
holder satisfies all of such Effective Time Holders applicable Payment
Conditions; (ii) each distribution to be made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
to a particular Effective Time Holder shall be effected in accordance with the
payment delivery instructions set forth in such Effective Time Holders Letter
of Transmittal, with respect to amounts to be distributed in respect of such
Effective Time Holders Outstanding Capital Stock; and (iii) all written
instructions to be delivered to the Escrow Agent with respect to any
distribution from the Escrow Fund shall be consistent with this  _Section
10.6(c)_.

(d) The release of any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Effective
Time Holders pursuant to this Section 10.6 shall be deemed an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

10.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 10.7_ is referred to as the "
_Indemnified Party_ ," and the party against whom such claim for
indemnification is asserted under this _Section 10.7_ is referred to as
the " _Indemnifying Party_."

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
the Company, Parent or any other Person) made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_
") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to promptly give such written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained
by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in or, upon providing written notice to the Indemnified Party
within twenty (20) days of receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim in
which the Indemnifying Party acknowledges without qualification its
indemnification obligation hereunder (subject only to the applicable
limitations set forth in _Sections 10._ 1, _10._ 3 and _10.7_ ), to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by
the Indemnifying Partys own counsel. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to _Section 10.7(b)_,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably in the defense thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ ,
that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there
are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the portion of
such fees and disbursements attributable to such additional defenses shall be
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to give timely and
sufficient notification to the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement, or loses its right to defend such Third
Party Claim by failing to diligently defend such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 10.7(b)_, without prejudice to its
right to indemnification hereunder, pay, compromise and defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Damages based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Section 10.7_, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume control of a Third Party Claim if (i) the
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, investigation or allegation, (ii) the Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable relief or relief other than
for monetary Damages against the Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes that the Third Party Claim, if adversely determined,
would materially impair the financial condition, business, operations,
reputation or prospects of the

 



58  Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) an actual or readily
apparent conflict of interest (as determined by the Indemnified Party after
obtaining advice of counsel) exists between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party Claim that precludes
effective joint representation or (v) the amounts reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection with such Third Party Claim, together with all other
outstanding claims on the Indemnity Escrow Fund, exceed the amount remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If, pursuant to this _Section 10.7(a)_, the
Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or settles a Third
Party Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for the
reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses of defending the Third Party
Claim which are incurred from time to time, promptly following the
presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for such attorneys
fees and other expenses, subject, however, to any applicable limitations set
forth in _Sections 10._ 1, _10._ 3, and  _10.7_. Subject to any applicable
limitations set forth in _Sections 10._ 1, _10.3_ , and _10.7_ , all expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection
with the foregoing shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. __

(b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so
long as: (i) a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim that (A) does
not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates (including any equitable remedies or other
obligations or restrictions upon the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates), (B) would not lead to any liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, and (C) provides, in customary form, for the full,
unconditional written release of each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the
Indemnified Party that it desires to accept and agree to such offer and the
terms thereof. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to
_Section 10.7(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

(c) _Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
each use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including, upon the reasonable request of the Indemnifying
Party, providing copies of records within the Indemnified Partys possession
or control relating to such Third Party Claim and making available, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses), Representatives of the Indemnified Party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(d) _Coordination with Tax Contests_. If there shall be any conflicts between
the provisions of this _Section 10.7_ and  _Section 6.3_, the provisions of
_Section 6.3_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

10.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) in the event of fraud (other than any fraud
claim based upon negligent misrepresentation) with respect to another party
hereto or an Indemnified Party hereunder (but subject to _Section
10.3(e)(ii)_), and (b) for equitable remedies and remedies that cannot be
waived as a matter of law, from and after the Effective Time, the rights to
indemnification, compensation and reimbursement set forth in this _Section
10_ shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Indemnitees with
respect to any matters arising under or relating to this Agreement.

 



59 10.9 Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent. No Parent Indemnitee (other
than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.

10.10 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The parties agree to report each
indemnification payment made in respect of any Damages as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes unless the indemnified party
determines in good faith that such reporting position is incorrect (it
being understood that if any reporting position is later disallowed in any
administrative or court proceedings, the indemnifying party shall indemnify
the indemnified party for the effects of such disallowance, and it being
further understood that the obligations under this parenthetical clause shall
remain in effect without limitation as to time).

11\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

11.1 Securityholders Agent.

 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement,
the Acknowledgment and Release Agreements and/or the Warrant Surrender
Agreements, the Effective Time Holders irrevocably nominate, constitute and
appoint Founder as the agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of the
Effective Time Holders (the " _Securityholders  Agent_"), with full power of
substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of the Effective Time
Holders for purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions that
the Securityholders Agent may, in the Securityholders Agents
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in
connection with this Agreement and any other agreement, document or instrument
referred to in or contemplated by this Agreement and any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or any such other agreement, document or
instrument, including with respect to or in connection with: (i) any claim for
indemnification under _Sections 6_ and _10_ or the Escrow Agreement; (ii)
enforcing any rights of the Effective Time Holders to receive or make
payments pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the
Earn-Out Consideration, the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Working Capital Escrow
Fund, the Holdback Amount and the Earn-Out Holdback Amount; (iii) negotiating
and settling or compromising indemnification claims or claims to enforce the
rights of the Effective Time Holders that may include amendments to the rights
Effective Time Holders hereunder; and (iv) giving and receiving notices as
provided for herein.

(b) _Authority_. The Effective Time Holders grant to the
Securityholders Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge,
certify and file on behalf of such Effective Time Holders (in the name of any
or all of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise) any and all documents that
the Securityholders Agent may, in his sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Securityholders Agent may, in his sole discretion,
determine to be appropriate, in performing his duties as contemplated by
_Section 11.1(a)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) each Parent Indemnitee shall
be entitled to deal exclusively with the Securityholders Agent on all
matters relating to any claim for indemnification under _Section 10_ or under
the Escrow Agreement); and (ii) each Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to
rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Effective Time
Holder by the Securityholders Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the
Securityholders Agent, as fully binding upon such Effective Time Holder.

(c)  _Power of Attorney_. The Effective Time Holders recognize and intend
that the power of attorney granted in _Section 11.1(a)_: (i) is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Securityholders
Agent; and (iii) shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up of each of the Effective Time Holders.

 



60 (d) _Replacement_. If the Securityholders Agent shall die, resign,
become disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities
hereunder, the Effective Time Holders shall (by consent of those Persons who
contributed at least fifty percent (50%) of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the
Escrow Fund), within ten (10) days after such death, disability or inability,
appoint a successor to the Securityholders Agent (who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) and promptly thereafter notify Parent of the identity
of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed the Securityholders
Agent as Securityholders Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no
Securityholders Agent at any time, all references herein to the
Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Effective Time
Holders.

(e) _Limitation of Liability_. The Securityholders Agent shall not be liable
to any of the Effective Time Holders for any action taken by the
Securityholders Agent pursuant to this Agreement unless the Securityholders
Agent has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence. The Securityholders
Agent is serving in the capacity as exclusive agent of the Effective Time
Holders hereunder. The Effective Time Holders shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Securityholders Agent to the fullest extent permitted by law
(i) for all costs and expenses of the Securityholders Agent incurs in the
exercise of such Securityholders Agents authority granted under this
Agreement, (ii) if the Securityholders Agent was or is or becomes a party to
or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or
a witness or other participant in, any threatened, pending or completed
proceeding (an " _Agent Claim_ ") by reason of (or arising in part out of) any
event or occurrence related to the fact that the Securityholders Agent is or
was an Effective Time Holders representative, or by reason of any action or
inaction on the part of the Securityholders Agent while serving in such
capacity, against any and all expenses (including attorneys fees and all
other costs, expenses and obligations incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any
proceeding), judgments, fines and penalties of such Agent Claim, and (iii)
against any Taxes imposed on the Securityholders Agent as a result of the
actual or deemed receipt of any payments under this Agreement ((i), (ii)
and (iii), collectively, the " _Agent Expenses_ "), including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of such Agent Expenses. To the extent the Securityholders Agent is owed
any Agent Expenses, Securityholders Agent is authorized to obtain payment of
such Agent Expenses from the Securityholders Agent Fund. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Securityholders Agent be indemnified for
any Agent Expenses that arise out of the Securityholders Agents gross
negligence or actions he takes in bad faith.

(f)  _Decisions Final_. Any decision or action by the Securityholders Agent,
including any agreement between the Securityholders Agent and Parent relating
to the defense, payment or settlement of any claims (including claims
for which the Escrow Fund may be available to indemnify any of the Parent
Indemnitees) under this Agreement, shall constitute a decision or action of
the Effective Time Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each such Effective Time Holder. None of the Effective Time Holders shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

(g)  _Securityholders  Agent Fund_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, there shall be established a fund in the amount
of $3,000,000 (the " _Securityholders  Agent Fund_"), to be deposited
immediately after the Effective Time in a separate account with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The Securityholders Agent Fund may be
used by the Securityholders Agent to (i) make any payment required to be
made by the Securityholders Agent on behalf of the Effective Time Holders
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) pay all costs and expenses incurred by or
on behalf of the Securityholders Agent, in his capacity as such,
including all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any pending or
threatened dispute or claim with respect to this Agreement, any agreement,
document or instrument entered into pursuant to this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



61 (h) _Parent s Reliance_. The Effective Time Holders further authorize,
approve and agree that Parent may rely conclusively, absolutely and
exclusively, without inquiry, upon any communication given or action taken by
the Securityholders Agent as the communication or action of each Effective
Time Holder in communications or actions required or permitted to be given or
taken by the Securityholders Agent hereunder and will not be liable to any
Effective Time Holder or any other Person for any communication given or not
given or action taken or not taken in reliance upon the direction of the
Securityholders Agent. Purchaser will not be obligated to inquire as to the
authority of the Securityholders Agent with respect to the giving of any
communication or the taking of any action that the Securityholders Agent
gives or takes on behalf of any Effective Time Holder.

11.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out
or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud. The Liability of any Person
under _Section 10_ will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other
Liability that such Person may have at law or in equity based on fraud
committed by such Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this Agreement,
including the provisions set forth in _Section 10_, except for _Section
10.3(e)(ii)_, to which this _Section 11.3_ shall be subject, shall be deemed
a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy which such
party may have at law or in equity based on the fraud of any other Person, nor
will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of
recovery sought or awarded in any claim for fraud against such other Person;
(b) the time period during which a claim for fraud may be brought against such
other Person; or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek against such
other Person with respect to a claim for fraud.

11.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to _Sections 1.5_ and _10_ and the Escrow
Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay all fees, costs
and expenses that have been incurred or that are incurred in the future up
until the Effective Time by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the
negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Letter) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required
to be made or given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in
connection with any of such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the
Merger.

 

11.5 Attorneys Fees. If any action, suit or other Legal Proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

shall prepare or cause to be prepared (i) the Surviving Corporations FY 2015
balance sheet and income statement (the " _Earn-Out Financial Statements_ ")
prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Parent Closing Balance Sheet and (ii)
a calculation of 2015 Adjusted EBITDA (as derived from the Earn-Out Financial
Statements and other applicable financial statements of Parent and its
Affiliates) and, based upon such calculation, the Earn-Out Consideration (the
" _Earn-Out Calculation_ " and, collectively with the other items in this
Section 4(i) and 4(ii), the " _Earn-Out Deliveries_ "). Parent shall deliver
the Earn-Out Deliveries to the Securityholders Agent, on behalf of the

provide the Securityholders Agent and his agents and representatives with
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the personnel and the
books and records of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the extent
related to the Securityholders Agents evaluation of the Earn-Out

practicable after the delivery of the Earn-Out Deliveries, an authorized
representative of Parent shall meet in person or by telephone with the
Securityholders Agent and its advisors at a mutually agreed upon time to
review the information set forth in the Earn-Out Deliveries. The

Parent of such disagreement in writing (the " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_ "),
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement,
within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Earn-Out Deliveries (the "

not provide an Earn-Out Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out
Review Period, the Securityholders Agent shall be deemed to have accepted
the Earn-Out Calculation, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event an Earn-Out Dispute Notice is timely
provided, then the Securityholders Agent and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in good

 



E-2  faith to reach agreement on the Earn-Out Calculation within the next thirty
(30) day period following the Earn-Out Review Period. If the Securityholders
Agent and Parent are unable to reach agreement on the Earn-Out Calculation
within thirty (30) days after the end of the Earn-Out Review Period, then
Parent and the Securityholders Agent shall submit the unresolved objections
to the Accounting Firm, and such firm shall be directed by Parent and the
Securityholders Agent to resolve the unresolved objections as promptly as
reasonably practicable. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute
by the Accounting Firm: (i) each of Parent and the Securityholders Agent
shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accounting Firm to
provide their views as to any disputed issues with respect to the Earn-Out
Calculation, (ii) the Accounting Firm shall determine the Earn-
Out Calculation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within sixty
(60) days of its engagement and upon reaching such determination shall deliver
a copy of the Earn-Out Calculation to the Securityholders Agent and Parent,
and (iii) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Earn-Out
Calculation shall be final and binding on Parent, the Securityholders Agent
and the Effective Time Holders for all purposes of this Agreement, absent
manifest error; provided that such determination shall not affect any rights
of the Parties for breaches of this Agreement. In calculating the Earn-Out
Calculation, the Accounting Firm (x) shall be limited to addressing any
particular disputes referred to in the Earn-Out Dispute Notice and (y) such
calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item included in the Earn-Out
Calculation, be no greater than the higher amount calculated by the
Securityholders Agent or Parent, and no less than the lower amount
calculated by the Securityholders Agent or Parent, as the case may be. The
Accounting Firm Earn-Out Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences,
if any, between the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA reflected therein and the
2015 Adjusted EBITDA set forth in the Earn-Out Deliveries. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party whose positions
generally did not substantially prevail in such determination as determined by
the Accounting Firm, or if the Accounting Firm determines that neither party
could be fairly found to be the substantially prevailing party, then such fees
and expenses shall be borne equally by Parent and the Securityholders Agent.

Companies to, without the written consent of the Securityholders Agent:

 

(i) make any changes to the Acquired Companies business model or take any
actions that would materially and adversely affect the ability of the
Effective Time Holders to receive the Earn-Out Consideration;

 



E-3 (ii) fail to maintain the Surviving Corporation (or its successor) as a
separate entity or business unit or fail to maintain separate financial
records for the business conducted by the Surviving Corporation (or its
successor) or such business unit for the purposes of calculating 2015 Adjusted
EBITDA;

 

(iii) relocate Founder or any Designated Shareholder to a location outside
such Designated Shareholders then-current job location, without the consent
of such individual;

(iv) subject to compliance with third party contractual or intellectual
property rights, materially delay the launch of any products or services
developed by the Acquired Companies, in either case, in a manner that would
materially and adversely affect the ability of the Effective Time Holders to
receive the Earn-Out Consideration; or 

(v) assign duties to Founder or any Designated Shareholder that would
materially and adversely affect the ability of the Effective Time Holders to
receive the Earn-Out Consideration.

7\. _Treatment of Earn-Out in the Event of a Fundamental Sale_.

 

(a) In the event of (i) any sale, lease, transfer or other divestiture of all
or a material portion of the assets comprising the "Premium PC," "Free-to-
Play Casual" or "Free-to-Play Casino" businesses of the Acquired Companies (as
reflected in the Budget), (ii) any sale of all or a material portion of the
equity of the Acquired Companies, whether by merger, consolidation, exchange
or sale, or (iii) any transaction or series of transactions which are similar
in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions, in each
case, during the period from the day after the Closing Date through December
31, 2015 (each, a " _Fundamental Sale_ "), then the maximum Earn-Out
Consideration ( _ _i.e.__ , $350,000,000) shall automatically, without any
other action of the parties or any other party, become immediately due and
payable by Parent in accordance with _Sections 1_ through _3_ of this _Exhibit
E_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Fundamental Sale shall not be deemed to
occur in connection with (x) any transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which there is a change in control of Parent or a
sale or other transfer by Parent of all or substantially all of its assets or
(y) any internal reorganization or similar transfer of assets or equity of an
Acquired Company to Parent or one of its Affiliates.

(b) For purposes of the Earn-Out Consideration, the Acquired Companies
acquisition of any business, business unit or division or any material assets
outside the ordinary course of business (whether directly or indirectly, by
merger, consolidation, exchange or sale), during the period from the
Closing Date through December 31, 2015, shall not be within the scope of 2015
Adjusted EBITDA, and appropriate adjustments (e.g., to 2015 Adjusted EBITDA,
including the exclusion of any expenses associated with the acquisition or
operation of such a business, business unit, division or material assets from
the calculation of 2015 Adjusted EBITDA) will be made to give effect to such
acquisition.

 

8\. _Defined Terms_ : For purposes of this _Exhibit E_ :

 

" _2015 Adjusted EBITDA_ " means the sum of (i) the EBITDA of the Acquired
Companies for fiscal year 2015, adjusted for any one-time or extraordinary
items, in each case mutually agreed to by Parent and the Securityholders
Agent, and (ii) 2015 Change in Deferred Profit. For the avoidance of doubt,
the separate books and records of the Acquired Companies maintained pursuant
to Section 6(a)(iii) of this _Exhibit E_ , and any calculation of 2015
Adjusted EBITDA, will exclude the effect of any acquisition-related
adjustments resulting from business combination accounting rules that would
not exist if the acquisition did not take place.

 



E-4 " _2015 Change in Deferred Profit_ " means the product of (a) the
difference between (x) the actual ending balance of the Deferred Revenue of
the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2015 and (y) $91,700,000 _multiplied
by_ (b) the 2015 Deferred Profit Margin.

 

" _2015 Deferred Profit Margin_ " means the quotient of (i) Deferred Profit as
of December 31, 2015, divided by (ii) Deferred Revenue as of December 31,
2015.

" _Deferred Profit_ " means Deferred Revenue _less_ the following associated
pre-Tax costs relating to Deferred Revenue: network/delivery costs, third
party platform fees, developer royalties and any other then applicable costs.

 

" _Deferred Revenue_ " means deferred revenue as calculated on a basis
consistent with GAAP (it being understood that to the extent that GAAP
permits alternate treatments the particular treatment used in the audited
financial statements of Parent shall be used) and on a basis consistent with
the Company Financial Statements.

 

" _Earn-Out Consideration_ " means the product of (a) nine _multiplied by_ (b)
the difference of (i) 2015 Adjusted EBITDA _less_ (ii) $51,200,000;
_provided_ , that the amount of such Earn-Out Consideration shall not exceed
$350,000,000.

 

" _EBITDA_ " means net income, _plus_ interest expense, _plus_ provision of
income tax, _plus_ depreciation and amortization, _plus_ foreign exchange
(gains) or losses, _plus_ any equity-based compensation expense included in
the calculation of net income of the Acquired Companies for fiscal 2015.
