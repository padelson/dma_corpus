</P>
</B><P>2.1  <U>Purchase and Sale of Purchased Assets; Assumed Liabilities</U>.</P>

<P>(a)&#9;On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing referred to below, the Buyer shall purchase from the Seller, and the Seller shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances, to the Buyer, all of the Purchased Assets. At the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller in immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller an amount equal to the 50% of the Non-Loan Purchased Asset Value (the "First Payment").  Simultaneously with Closing, Buyer shall pay the Indebtedness Payoff Amount calculated as of the Closing directly to Irwin Union Bank &amp; Trust Company and other warehouse lenders, as applicable, in the respective amounts necessary to pay the Intercompany Credit Line and each warehouse lending facility of Seller used to fund mortgage loans (in an amount equal to the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Company Mortgage Loans). The Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to 25% of the Non-Loan Purchased Asset Value (the "Second Payment"), on or before the date 45 days after the Closing Date.  The Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to 25% of the Non-Loan Purchased Asset Value (the "Third Payment") on or before the date 75 days after the Closing Date.  The Buyer shall pay to Seller on or before the earlier of 75 days after the Closing Date or three (3) Business Days after the Buyer has effected the sale of all Company Mortgage Loans (the "Deferral Payment Date") either the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts Amount or, in the event that the Final LHFS Other Accounts Amount has been determined pursuant to Section 2.2(a) by the Deferral Payment Date, then the Buyer shall pay the Final LHFS Other Accounts Amount to Seller on the Deferral Payment Date; provided, however, no payment shall be due to Seller on the Deferral Payment Date if the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts, or the Final LHFS Other Accounts, as the case may be, is a negative amount.  In the event that the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts Amount or the Final LHFS Other Accounts, as the case may be, is a negative amount, then Seller shall pay to Buyer on the Deferral Payment Date such negative amount.<BR>
<BR>
(b)&#9;As additional consideration for the Purchased Assets and the agreements and undertakings set forth in this Agreement, at Closing the Buyer will assume and agree to pay, satisfy and discharge, when due, the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall not assume or in any way become liable for any of the Seller's Liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever other than the Assumed Liabilities, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether known or unknown, whether due or to become due, whether related to the Seller's business or the Purchased Assets and whether disclosed on the schedules attached hereto, and regardless of when or by whom asserted.<BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;In the event that the Pre-Closing Account Value exceeds the Final Account Value (as determined pursuant to Section 2.2), Buyer shall pay Seller such excess amount within three (3) Business Days after the Determination Date (provided, however, that if the Second Payment or Third Payment has not yet been made, the Buyer shall pay 25% of such amount on the date of the Second Payment and 25% on the date of the Third Payment, as applicable, and the remainder on the Determination Date). In the event that the Final Account Value exceeds the Pre-Closing Account Value (as determined pursuant to Section 2.2 and subject to any holdback set forth therein), the Seller shall pay such excess amount to Buyer within three Business Days after the Determination Date (provided, however, that if the Second Payment or Third Payment has not yet been made, the Buyer shall deduct such excess amount from such upcoming payment(s) owed to Seller and the remainder of such amount shall be paid by Seller to Buyer within three (3) Business Days after the Determination Date). In the event that the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts, rather than the Final LHFS Other Accounts, is paid on the Deferral Payment Date, (i) to the extent that the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts Amount exceeds the Final LHFS Other Accounts, Seller shall pay Buyer such excess amount within three (3) Business Days after the Determination Date; and (ii) to the extent that the Final LHFS Other Accounts Amount exceeds the Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts, Buyer shall pay Seller such excess amount within three (3) Business Days after the Determination Date. If the Final Net Outstanding Charges Balance (determined pursuant to Section 2.2) is positive, Seller shall pay such amount to Buyer within three (3) Business Days after the Adjustment Date.  If the Final Net Outstanding Charges Balance is negative, Buyer shall pay such amount to Seller within three (3) Business Days after the Adjustment Date. <BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;After the Closing Seller shall collect in due course the gross settlement proceeds to which it is entitled in respect of Unsettled Mortgage Loans (represented by account 14100 on the Reference Balance Sheet under the Excluded Assets column and determined in a manner consistent with Seller's past practice under FAS 140, the "Settlement Proceeds"). Within five (5) Business Days after all Settlement Proceeds have been received, Seller's Chief Financial Officer will (A) calculate, in good faith: (i) the Settlement Proceeds, (ii) the Stated Principal Balance for the Unsettled Mortgage Loans less any points paid by the borrower to Seller in exchange for reduction of interest rate in respect of an Unsettled Mortgage Loan (the "Loan Basis") as of the applicable sale date of each such loan (the "Sale Date"); (iii) the origination costs and fees paid associated with the Unsettled Mortgage Loans as of the Sale Date as reflected by account numbers 14630, 14640, and 15250 on the Reference Balance Sheet under the Excluded Assets column (the "Origination Costs"), each determined in accordance with the procedures and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D, and in a manner consistent with the Reference Balance Sheet, and (B) deliver to Buyer a statement certified by the Seller's Chief Financial Officer (the "Gain Statement") setting forth such foregoing amounts and the amount equal to 50% of the difference of the Settlement Proceeds minus the Loan Basis minus the Origination Costs (the "Eligible Gain") and reasonable supporting documentation for the same. At the time of delivery of the Gain Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Eligible Gain. Buyer shall have ten (10) Business Days to review the Gain Statement, and Seller shall afford Buyer with access to supplemental records and information as Buyer may reasonably request for such purpose.  If Buyer does not object to Seller's calculation of the Eligible Gain by delivering written notice before the end of such period setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed items, the amounts and estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying Buyer's objections, the Eligible Gain reflected on the Gain Statement shall be final and binding.  If Buyer gives timely notice of objection to the calculation of the Eligible Gain (setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed items, the amounts or estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying the Buyer's objections), the Parties will try in good faith to resolve the objections.  Failing such resolution, either Party may refer the disputed matter to the CPA Firm using the procedures prescribed in Section 2.2(a).  The Eligible Gain that becomes final and binding is referred to herein as the "Final Eligible Gain."  The date the Final Eligible Gain is finally determined is the "Eligible Gain Date". In the event that the Eligible Gain set forth in the Gain Statement exceeds the Final Eligible Gain (as determined pursuant to Section 2.2), Seller shall pay Buyer such excess amount within three (3) Business Days after the Eligible Gain Date. For avoidance of doubt, the Eligible Gain shall be determined without regard to any accrued interest, points or fees (other than points paid by the borrower to Seller in exchange for reduction of interest rate) received or to be received by Seller in respect of the Unsettled Mortgage Loans, all of which shall be wholly retained and inure to the credit of Seller.<BR>
<BR>
(e)&#9;As additional purchase price, the Seller shall be eligible to receive Earn-Out Payments from Buyer for each of the first three twelve (12) month-periods following the Closing (each a "Twelve-Month Period") on the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Each "Earn-Out Payment" shall be an amount equal to three (3) basis points (.03) multiplied by the difference of (i) the total principal amount of mortgage loans originated or acquired by Buyer during the applicable Twelve-Month Period through Buyer's branches previously operated by Seller or as a result of loan production activities of Continuing Employees (even if such Continuing Employees are relocated by Buyer) less (ii) $9.5 Billion.  Within thirty (30) days after the end of the applicable Twelve-Month Period, Buyer shall calculate the Earn-Out Payment for such period and deliver to Seller an officer's certificate setting forth the calculation of such Earn-Out Payment and pay to Seller such amount, if any, provided however, that if Buyer does not deliver such notice and pay such amount within the foregoing time period, Seller shall provide written notice to Buyer of same, and Buyer shall be able to cure within (5) days after receipt of such notice. The calculation of the Earn-Out Payment will be final, conclusive and binding on Seller unless within thirty (30) days after receipt from Buyer of the calculation of the Earn-Out Payment for the applicable Twelve-Month Period, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of Seller's objections to Buyer's calculation of the applicable Earn-Out Payment, specifically identifying the disputed items, the amounts or estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying the Seller's objections. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute regarding an Earn-Out Payment within 30 days after Seller's notification of its dispute, either party may elect to utilize the procedure described in Section 2.2 to engage the CPA Firm to determine the resolution of any disputed Earn-Out Payment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation to make Earn-Out Payments in the aggregate in excess of $750,000 or in excess of $250,000 with respect to any Twelve-Month Period.<BR>
<BR>
(f)&#9;The sum of the Non-Loan Purchased Asset Value, Pre-Closing Assumed Payables, Pre-Closing LHFS Other Accounts Amount (or the Final LHFS Other Accounts Amount if such amount is paid on the Deferral Payment Date), the Indebtedness Payoff Amount, the Final Eligible Gain, any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (with any amounts paid to Seller as an addition and any amounts paid by Seller as a subtraction) and any Earn-Out Payments, are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "Purchase Price."<BR>
<BR>
(g)&#9;Attached hereto as Exhibit E is a balance sheet of the Business (the "Reference Balance Sheet") setting forth the parties' good faith estimation of the book value of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as of June 30, 2006, each calculated in accordance with GAAP (including FASB 91) or otherwise in accordance with the procedures and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D. Seller shall cause its Chief Financial Officer to prepare a balance sheet dated within six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing (the "Pre-Closing Balance Sheet") based upon the same methodology on which the Reference Balance Sheet was prepared and pursuant to which there shall be determined the book value of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Date") and such Pre-Closing Balance Sheet shall be delivered to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall cause its Chief Financial Officer to prepare and deliver to Buyer and MDMC on the date which is seven (7) days prior to the Closing updated lists, as of such date, of the Company Mortgage Loans and Pipeline Loans in the same format as Schedule 1.1(b)(i) and Schedule 1.1(b)(ii) hereof and a "tape" of such Company Mortgage Loans.<BR>
<BR>
(h)&#9;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Second Payment, Third Payment, any payments due on the Deferral Payment Date and any adjustments provided for in subsections (c) and (d) above payable by the Buyer to the Seller shall be offset dollar for dollar to the extent of any amount that Seller owes to Buyer pursuant to subsection (c) and (d) above (including amounts subject to bona fide dispute in accordance with the provisions hereof).<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>2.2  <U>Determination of Adjustments; Outstanding Charges.</U>  </P>

<P>(a)&#9;Within 15 days after the Closing, the Seller will prepare and deliver to the Buyer a balance sheet of the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which will be prepared in accordance with GAAP (including FASB 91) or otherwise in accordance with the procedures and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D, and in a manner consistent with the Reference Balance Sheet. The Buyer will provide reasonable support to the Seller and its Representatives to enable them to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet, including providing reasonable access to and the right to copy the books and records of the Business.  Buyer will have the opportunity to review the Closing Balance Sheet for 45 days after the Closing Balance Sheet is delivered by the Seller solely for the purpose of verifying the LHFS Other Accounts, Assumed Payables and Other Assets as set forth therein (the "Review Period").  During the Review Period, the Seller will provide to the Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to information to enable Buyer to review the Closing Balance Sheet.  The Closing Balance Sheet will be final, conclusive and binding on the Buyer unless, during the Review Period, the Buyer notifies the Seller in writing of the Buyer's objections to the Seller's determination of the LHFS Other Accounts, Assumed Payables or Other Assets set forth therein, specifically identifying the disputed items, the amounts or estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying the Buyer's objections.  If the Buyer gives notice of any objection to the LHFS Other Accounts, Assumed Payables or Other Assets set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet, the Parties will try in good faith to resolve the objections within 30 days after the delivery of notice by the Buyer.  If the Parties resolve the objections within that time period, they will promptly record the resolution in a writing signed by each of them, and the resolution will be final, conclusive and binding on each of them.  If the Parties are unable to resolve the objections within that time period, the Parties promptly will refer any disputed matter to the Chicago office of Grant Thornton LLP (the "CPA Firm").  Should such firm be unable or unwilling to serve, the CPA Firm shall be a regionally or nationally recognized certified public accounting firm having no prior relationship with the Parties or their Affiliates mutually selected by the Buyer and the Seller, which will be independent of Buyer, Seller, Shareholder and their respective Affiliates; provided that if the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the substitute CPA Firm within 60 days, the Buyer and the Seller will each designate an accounting firm, and such accounting firms will promptly thereafter jointly select the substitute CPA Firm. Each of the Buyer and Seller will pay one-half of the fees and expenses of such accounting firm.  The CPA Firm will act as a neutral arbitrator, and to the extent GAAP, this Agreement and the procedures and methodologies set forth in Exhibit D leave room for discretion, will exercise that discretion independently, but within the range of differences between the Parties.  The Parties will be afforded an opportunity to present their positions and such materials as the CPA Firm will deem appropriate.  The CPA Firm will be instructed to revise the LHFS Other Accounts, Assumed Payables and/or Other Assets, as applicable, to reflect its resolution of the disputed matters within 90 days following its engagement, which resolution will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.  The LHFS Other Accounts, Assumed Payables and the Other Assets in the form that is final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereunder, is referred to in this Agreement as the "Final LHFS Other Accounts," the "Final Assumed Payables" and the "Final Other Assets," respectively. The date on which any of the foregoing amounts is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.2 is referred to as the "Determination Date" with respect to such amount. The Final Assumed Payables minus the Final Other Assets is referred to herein as the "Final Account Value." If any dispute remains unresolved on the date the Second Payment or Third Payment is due under Section 2.1, Buyer shall timely pay the Second Payment or Third Payment to Seller, as applicable, net of the amount subject to bona fide dispute as evidenced by its notice of objection. <BR>
<BR>
(b)&#9;Within sixty (60) days following Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a reconciliation of the Outstanding Charges on which (i) that portion of each of the Outstanding Charges that relates or is attributable to the period prior to Closing, but had not been paid by Seller is reflected as a positive number (for the account of Seller) and (ii) that portion of each of the Outstanding Charges that relates or is attributable to the period on and subsequent to Closing, but was paid by Seller, is reflected as a negative number (for the account of Buyer).  Such reconciliation shall be certified by the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer and shall be provided in an item by item detail with reasonable supporting documentation.  Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to review the reconciliation of Outstanding Charges, and Buyer shall afford Seller with access to supplemental records and information as Seller may reasonably request for such purpose.  If Seller does not object to Buyer's reconciliation by delivering written notice before the end of such period setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed items, the amounts and estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying Seller's objections, the net Outstanding Charges balance reflected thereon shall be final and binding.  If Seller gives timely notice of objection to the reconciliation (setting forth in reasonable detail the disputed items, the amounts or estimated amounts of the disputed items and the basic facts underlying the Seller's objections), the Parties will try in good faith to resolve the objections.  Failing such resolution, either Party may refer the disputed matter to the CPA Firm using the procedures prescribed in Section 2.2(a).  The net Outstanding Charges balance that becomes final and binding is the "Final Net Outstanding Charges Balance."  The date the Final Net Outstanding Charges Balance is finally determined is the "Adjustment Date". <BR>

Neither the Collateral nor any party to any related security agreement securing a Company Mortgage Loan has been released, with the exception of releases required by divorce decrees, releases required by assumptions, and other releases effected in accordance with Investor requirements. <BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;Except as set forth in Schedule 4.19(c), at the date hereof, the Seller has received no written notice asserting any offset, defense (including the defense of usury), claim (including claims of lender liability), counterclaim, or right to rescission with respect to any Company Mortgage Loan, related Mortgage Note or other related agreements.<BR>

All monies received with respect to each Company Mortgage Loan have been properly accounted for and applied. The Seller has complied with all material contractual obligations which relate to any of the Company Mortgage Loans.</P>
<P><BR>
(e)&#9;The Loan Documents are genuine, legally valid, binding and enforceable (except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally) obligations of the Mortgagors and have been duly executed by or on behalf of a Mortgagor of legal capacity, and all insertions in any such Loan Documents were correct when made.

Neither the FHA, the VA nor any provider of the PMI has issued to the Seller any notice disclaiming liability on the insurance or guaranty of any Company Mortgage Loan purported to be insured by the FHA or the provider of the PMI or guaranteed by the VA and to the Sellers' Knowledge there exist no facts that would provide a basis for rescission of any such insurance or guaranty, or would, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, provide such a basis for rescission.  The Seller has not canceled PMI policies with respect to any of the Company Mortgage Loans that were insured by providers of PMI at or subsequent to the time of the origination of the Company Mortgage Loans without the prior approval of the applicable Agency or Investor, unless such cancellation was permitted or required by applicable Mortgage Loan Regulations.<BR>

(h)&#9;Each Mortgage Note and Mortgage related to a Company Mortgage Loan is covered by a mortgage title insurance policy issued by a title insurer qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where the Collateral is located (and both the policy and the title insurer were acceptable to the applicable Investor at the time of origination), or are covered by an abstract of title and certification of attorney's mortgage lien opinion insuring the first or second priority lien of the Mortgage in the original principal amount of the related Mortgage Note.  If required by the applicable Mortgage Loan Regulations, the appropriate Investor is the insured under such title insurance policy. <BR>
<BR>

There exists no uninsured physical damage to the Collateral from fire, wind, storm, earthquake or any other casualty, circumstance or condition, which physical damage would cause any Company Mortgage Loan to become delinquent or materially and adversely affect the marketability of any Company Mortgage Loan or the Collateral.  <BR>

Accordingly, if any provision of this Section 6.9 shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made and not with respect to any other provision or jurisdiction.<BR>

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</B><P>8.1  <U>Employees</U>.  On and effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer employment to substantially all of the employees of the Business.  Those employees of Seller who are employed by Buyer ("Continuing Employees") shall be engaged by Buyer on substantially economically equivalent terms and conditions, including pay and benefits, as their terms and conditions with the Seller on the Closing Date, as more particularly described on Schedule 8.1.  Employees of Seller who are not offered, or who do not accept, employment with Buyer at Closing are referred to as "Retained Employees".  <BR>
<BR>
8.2  <U>Benefit Plans</U>.  To comply with Section 8.1 Buyer shall make available to Continuing Employees either Transferred Benefit Plans or, with respect to benefits arrangements that have been available under the Seller Employee Plans that are not to be transferred to Buyer, benefits under the benefit plans sponsored by Buyer ("Replacement Plans"), as set forth on Schedule 8.1.  <BR>
<BR>
8.3  <U>Buyer's Post-Closing Benefit Obligations</U>.  The Buyer agrees that for a period ending no earlier than December 31, 2007, (or, with respect to a particular benefit plan or arrangement, such longer period as may be reflected in Schedule 8.1) and subject to such additional terms and conditions as may be set forth in Schedule 8.1, it will (i) maintain in full force and effect and unimpaired for the benefit of the Continuing Employees either (A) the Transferred Benefit Plans and the Buyer's Replacement Plans or (B) with respect to any Transferred Benefit Plan or the Buyer's Replacement Plans, a replacement plan that provides substantially similar benefits and (ii) maintain the salary and bonus compensation arrangements of Continuing Employees who are retained in their positions at a level that is substantially equivalent or greater in aggregate to that in effect on the Closing Date.  For avoidance of doubt, the Continuing Employees are at-will employees and may be terminated by the Buyer for any reason or no reason, and, in such event, shall be entitled to only such benefits as are normally provided by Buyer to terminated employees (subject to any written employment agreement between Buyer and such Continuing Employee).  For purposes of determining the eligibility, vesting, participation and seniority of Continuing Employees under a Transferred Benefit Plan, a Buyer's Replacement Plan or other benefit program, plan or arrangement maintained by the Buyer after the Closing for which a Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible, each Continuing Employee shall be given full credit under such employee benefit program, plan or arrangement for such Continuing Employee's period of service with the Seller and its predecessors prior to the Closing to the same extent such service was credited under a Seller Employee Plan.  In addition, a Continuing Employee who meets the eligibility requirements under the Retirement Plan immediately prior to Closing shall be eligible to participate in the Freedom Retirement Plan as of the Closing without regard to any age, service or other eligibility requirements of the Freedom Retirement Plan.  Continuing Employees shall be given full credit for deductibles, co-payment or out-of-pocket limits satisfied under Seller Employee Plans toward any deductibles, co-payment or out-of-pocket limits for the same period following the Closing under analogous Buyer benefit plans to the extent any such plan allows for credit without an increase in incremental cost to the Buyer other than a nominal administrative fee. The Buyer shall cause to be waived any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements or pre-existing condition limitations for any Continuing Employee covered under a Seller Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing.  The Buyer shall honor all vacation pay, sick leave and other paid time off accrued by any Continuing Employee to the extent reflected as a Final Assumed Payable.</P>
<P>8.4  <U>Allocation of Benefit Obligations</U>.  The Seller shall pay or shall cause the applicable Seller Employee Plan to pay any benefits or expenses covered by the group medical and dental plans included within the Seller Employee Plans (other than the Transferred Benefit Plans) which in the case of any such medical or dental plans, are incurred by Continuing Employees or their dependents prior to the Closing Date.  The Buyer shall pay or cause the applicable Transferred Benefit Plan or Buyer's Replacement Plan (or any replacement plan) to pay any such benefits or expenses which in the case of any such medical or dental plans, are incurred by the Continuing Employees or their dependents on or after the Closing Date.  A medical or dental expense is "incurred" for purposes of this Section 8.4 as of the date when the services that give rise to the expense are rendered, and not when the expense is billed.<BR>
<BR>
8.5  <U>COBRA Coverage</U>.  The Seller or the Seller Employee Plans shall be solely responsible for claims relating to coverage under COBRA attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any Continuing Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur before the Closing Date.  The Buyer, a Transferred Benefit Plan or a Buyer's Replacement Plan shall be solely responsible for claims relating to coverage under COBRA attributable to "qualifying events" occurring on or after the Closing Date with respect to Continuing Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents.  "COBRA" means Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code and any similar applicable state Laws.  <BR>
<BR>
8.6  <U>WARN Act</U>.</P>

<P>(a)&#9;The Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Loss arising under the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act, as amended  ("WARN Act"), or any equivalent state or local statute or ordinance, in each case requiring the provision of notices to Continuing Employees affected by a plant closing, mass layoff, or the like, relating to or arising from the failure to retain in employment, or the termination or layoff of any Continuing Employees or any other employment decision made by the Buyer on or after the Closing Date.  The Buyer shall also take all other steps necessary to eliminate any obligation of the Seller or any of its Affiliates under the WARN Act and any similar Law to give notice of transfer of any operations or the loss of employment or loss of pay or benefits or to pay any amounts in lieu of such notice with respect to Continuing Employees.<BR>
<BR>
The Seller shall be solely responsible for any Loss arising under the WARN Act, or any equivalent state or local statute or ordinance, in each case requiring the provision of notices to Retained Employees affected by a plant closing, mass layoff, or the like, relating to or arising from the failure to retain in employment, or the termination or layoff of any Retained Employees or any other employment decision made by the Seller on or after the Closing Date.  The Seller shall also take all other steps necessary to eliminate any obligation of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates under the WARN Act and any similar Law to give notice of transfer of any operations or the loss of employment or loss of pay or benefits or to pay any amounts in lieu of such notice with respect to Retained Employees.<BR>
<BR>
8.7  <U>Retirement Plan</U>.  Seller shall terminate the Retirement Plan as of the Plan Termination Date and as soon as practicable thereafter shall file "IRS Form 5310 - Application for Determination for Terminating Plan" seeking a determination that the Retirement Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.  The Freedom Retirement Plan will accept rollover contributions from the Retirement Plan on behalf of Continuing Employees as soon as administratively practicable after Closing ("Rollover Contributions"). Immediately prior to the initial Rollover Contribution, the plan administrator of the Retirement Plan (the "RP Administrator") shall provide to the plan administrator of the Freedom Retirement Plan (the "FR Administrator") a letter representing that (i) the Retirement Plan has satisfied or intends to satisfy all requirements under Section 401(a) of the Code and (ii) that the Retirement Plan has been operated in accordance with Section 401(a) of the Code.  Upon receipt by the Retirement Plan of either (i) a favorable determination letter that the Retirement Plan was a qualified plan through the date of its termination or (ii) a communication from the IRS that the Retirement Plan was not a qualified plan as of the date of its termination, the Seller hereby agrees to cause the RP Administrator to immediately provide a copy of such determination letter or such other communication to the FR Administrator.  In the event that the IRS should indicate that it cannot issue a favorable determination letter to the Retirement Plan or issues a ruling that the Retirement Plan was not a qualified plan, Seller hereby covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer, the Freedom Retirement Plan, its plan participants and fiduciaries, and the FR Administrator (the "FR Indemnitees"), harmless from and against all loss, cost or expenses of any nature whatsoever (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) incurred reasonably and in good faith by the FR Indemnitees in connection with (i) the acceptance of any Rollover Contribution and (ii) the distribution of all Rollover  Contributions to the Continuing Employees who had made such Rollover Contributions. <BR>
<BR>
8.8  <U>Immigration Matters</U>.   At Closing Buyer shall assume sponsorship of all visas or lawful permanent residence applications for, and employment-related immigration obligations with respect to, employees of the Business as set forth on Schedule 4.17(a)(ii) hereof.  If Buyer shall be required to pay any deportation or related costs in connection with the termination of employment within six months of the Closing Date of the individuals listed on Schedule 4.17(a)(ii), Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any such costs.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
(b)&#9;[Intentionally Omitted].  <BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;Schedule 9.1(c) contains a list of agreements (i) to which the Shareholder or an Affiliate is party or under which it derives benefits along with the Seller but which primarily benefits the Business, or (ii) that pertain to both Purchased Assets and Excluded Assets (the "Shared Contracts").  The Seller and Shareholder will use commercially reasonable efforts to separate the Shared Contracts as appropriate prior to the Closing (such separated Contracts relating to the Business shall be referred to as the "Shared Assigned Contracts").  <BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;Schedule 9.1(d) contains a list of agreements of the Seller or an Affiliate that will be subject to the Transition Services Agreement.  <BR>
<BR>
(e)&#9;The Seller, Shareholder and their Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the transfer, amendment or replacement, at the Seller's option, for the benefit of Buyer after the Closing of such portion of each Shared Contract that relates to the Business.  Upon any transfer of such a Contract or portion thereof, as the case may be to the Buyer, the Buyer shall assume all liabilities and obligations of the Seller, the Shareholder or their Affiliates, as applicable, related to the transferred portion of such Contract, except to the extent such liabilities and obligations (A) would have been paid, performed or otherwise discharged on or prior to transfer date but for a breach or default by the Seller, the Shareholder or their Affiliates, or (B) arise out of any breach or default by any such party.<BR>
<BR>
(f)&#9;The Seller, Shareholder and their Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as possible such third party consents as are required hereunder with respect to the transfer of the Assigned Contracts and Shareholder Assigned Contracts.  Upon any transfer of such a Contract to the Buyer, the Buyer shall assume all liabilities and obligations of the Seller, the Shareholder or their Affiliates, as applicable, related to such Contract, except to the extent such liabilities and obligations (A) would have been paid, performed or otherwise discharged on or prior to transfer date but for a breach or default by the Seller, the Shareholder or their Affiliates, or (B) arise out of any breach or default by any such party.<BR>
<BR>
(g)&#9;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the transfer, assignment, amendment, modification or replacement of any Assigned Contract, Shareholder Assigned Contract or Shared Contract (or Shared Assigned Contract, as the case may be) would require any approval, consent or waiver by another Person, and such approval, consent or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article III) proceed without the transfer, assignment, amendment, modification or replacement of any such Contract (or portion thereof, as the case may be), and this Agreement shall not constitute an unauthorized transfer, assignment or amendment of any such Contract or any portion thereof or an attempt thereof, provided that in the event that the Closing so proceeds without the transfer, assignment, amendment, modification or replacement of any such Contract or portion of any such Contract, then following the Closing, the Seller and Shareholder shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts, to assist Buyer at no cost to Buyer, to obtain promptly any such approval, consent or waiver and shall commencing on the Closing and prior to obtaining any such approval, consent or waiver, provide Buyer, at no cost to Buyer, with all of the rights and benefits (subject to all of the obligations) under any such Contract, through the term of such Contract including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and all rights of the Seller, Shareholder or its Affiliates against any other party arising out of any breach or cancellation of any such Contract by such other party and, if requested by Buyer, acting as an agent on behalf of Buyer or as Buyer shall otherwise reasonably require. Buyer acknowledges that where the Seller Assigned Contracts, Shareholder Assigned Contracts or the Shared Contracts contain pricing or other terms based on the volume of goods, services or activity of the Seller, Shareholder, its Affiliates or their employees related to the activities under such Contract or a related Contract, the counterparties to such Contracts may charge higher prices or impose less favorable terms upon Buyer as assignee or under a replacement Contract than those that have been available to Seller because Buyer will not be able to support  such higher volume, usage or activity; and with respect to such Seller Assigned Contracts, Shareholder Assigned Contracts or Shared Contracts Seller shall not be responsible to bear any portion of any such incremental cost incurred by Buyer as assignee or under such a replacement Contract hereunder.<BR>
<BR>
(h)&#9;Schedule 9.1(h) contains a true and complete list of all obligations of the Business that are secured by a guarantee by the Seller, the Shareholder or any of its Affiliates (the "Seller Guarantees").

<P>10.1  <U>Survival</U>.  The representations and warranties set forth in Article IV and Article V shall generally survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties of the Parties contained in Sections 4.1 (Organization, Authority), 4.7 (Taxes), 4.8(a) (Title to Purchased Assets), and 4.21 (Servicing) shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for a period beginning on the applicable Closing Date and ending sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and they shall thereafter be of no further force or effect.  All covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the applicable Closing and will remain in full force and effect thereafter until (i) in the case of all covenants and agreements that have specified terms or periods, until the expiration of the terms or periods specified therein; and (ii) in the case of all other covenants and agreements that do not have specified terms or periods, until the fulfillment thereof. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of any Party with respect to its representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any other Party hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the period of time that a provision survives the Closing and remains in full force and effect pursuant to this Section 10.1 (the "Survival Period") shall automatically be extended to include any time period necessary to resolve a specific claim for indemnification which was timely and properly made before expiration of the Survival Period but not resolved prior to its expiration; provided, however, that any such extension shall apply only as to claims asserted and not so resolved within the original Survival Period.  <BR>
<BR>
10.2  <U>Indemnification by the Seller.<BR>
<BR>
</U>(a)&#9;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 10.2(b)), each of the Seller and Shareholder shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, advisors, agents, employees, successors and assigns (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all costs, losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, lawsuits, deficiencies, claims, demands, and expenses (whether or not arising out of third-party claims), including interest, penalties, fines, costs of mitigation, costs of investigation, court costs, and reasonable attorneys', accountants', consultants' or experts' fees and disbursements but excluding incidental or consequential damages or diminution in value (each a "Loss" and, collectively the "Losses") directly or indirectly based upon, arising out of, resulting from or relating to:<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<P>&#9;(i)&#9;any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties given or made by Seller or Shareholder in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any certificate, instrument or document required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that if any such representation or warranty in Article IV (other than those in Section 4.4 (Financial Statements; Section 4.6 (Undisclosed Liabilities); the last sentence of 4.8(a) and 4.8(c) (Properties); Section 4.9 (Intellectual Property); Section 4.15 (Licenses and Permits), other than the second sentence thereof; the first sentence of Section 4.16 (Environmental Matters); Section 4.20 (Pipeline Loans) or Section 4.26 (Representations Complete)) is qualified in any respect by materiality or by reference to a Seller Material Adverse Effect, for purposes of this provision such materiality or Seller Material Adverse Effect qualification will in all respects be ignored;</P>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements given or made by Seller or Shareholder in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any certificate, instrument or document required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that if any such covenant or agreement is qualified in any respect by materiality, for purposes of this provision such materiality qualification will in all respects be ignored;  </P>

<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;any Excluded Liability; </P>

<P>&#9;(iv)&#9;the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets or the operation of the Seller's business on or before the Closing Date; </P>

<P>&#9;(v)&#9;any failure of Seller to Service mortgage loans in accordance with the provisions of the Transition Services Agreement (disregarding any limitation of warranty or liability provisions contained therein); and </P>

<P>&#9;(vi)&#9;the failure of Seller to comply (if required to comply) with any applicable bulk sales law. </P>

<P>(b)&#9;Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller's and Shareholder's obligation to indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless shall be limited as follows:<BR>
</P>
<P>(i)&#9;No claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against the Seller or Shareholder pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the Seller describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as provided herein, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date.</P>

<P>(ii)&#9;For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the Seller and Shareholder, the amount of each claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Seller or Shareholder pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall be limited to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment paid by any third party with respect thereto.</P>

<P>(iii)&#9;No indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) in respect of Losses arising from any particular claim or matter, unless and until all Losses arising from such particular matter exceed $1,500 (but in the event such related Losses exceed $1,500 then all such Losses shall be subject to indemnity pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)); provided, that multiple Losses of the same nature arising from a substantially identical cause, defect, error or a systemic problem, shall be aggregated and treated as one particular claim or matter.  In addition, no indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)  unless and until the aggregate of all Losses (other than those excluded from indemnity by the foregoing sentence) suffered by Buyer Indemnified Parties shall exceed $300,000 in the aggregate (the "Indemnity Threshold"), and then only to the extent of Losses in excess of such amount.  (For example, and for avoidance of doubt, a claim for $1,000 under Section 10.2(a)(i) would not be subject to indemnity and would not count toward the Indemnity Threshold, but a claim for $2,000 under such section would count toward the Indemnity Threshold.)  The Indemnity Threshold set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to Losses resulting from fraud or intentional misconduct by the Seller or its Affiliates, which shall be recoverable without respect to such threshold.  </P>

<P>(iv)&#9;Other than with respect to the (A) Seller's indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1 (Organization, Authority), 4.2 (No Conflict) 4.7 (Taxes), 4.8(a) (Title to Purchased Assets), and 4.16 (Environmental Matters) and (B) Seller's repurchase obligations under Section 10.2(c) and (d), (C) Seller's indemnification obligations pursuant Section 10.2(a)(iii)-(vi), and (D) Seller's Liabilities under any of the Ancillary Agreements, the aggregate liability of the Seller and Shareholder for Losses or otherwise with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby is, and shall be, limited to an aggregate amount equal to $3,000,000 (the "Seller's Liability Amount"), except in the event of fraud or intentional misconduct by the Seller or its Affiliates, and the Buyer, on behalf of itself and all Buyer Indemnified Parties, agrees not to seek recovery or indemnity for any such Losses in excess of the Seller's Liability Amount that may be sustained or incurred by any and all Buyer Indemnified Parties. <BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;Notwithstanding any provision in Section 10.2(a) or (b) and 10.4 to the contrary, with respect to any Company Mortgage Loan purchased by Buyer from Seller at the Closing that is resold by the Buyer to a third party Investor in the ordinary course of business either pursuant to a Seller Investor Commitment or Forward Delivery Contract or a secondary market residential mortgage loan sale agreement (a "Covered Company Loan"), if an Approved Investor requests the repurchase of a Covered Company Loan based on an asserted breach of a representation or warranty, or if any other Investor requests the repurchase of a Covered Company Loan based on an asserted breach of a commercially reasonable and customary representation or warranty in its residential mortgage loan sale agreement with the Buyer, at the option of Buyer, Seller or Shareholder shall repurchase such Covered Company Loan from the Buyer or the applicable Investor, provided that written demand for the repurchase is received by Seller from the Buyer within six (6) years after the Closing of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.  The price for such repurchase shall be the Repurchase Price, which shall be divided between the Buyer and Investor appropriately with the balance of the Repurchase Price in excess of the amount demanded by the Investor being paid to the Buyer.  Prior to Buyer causing the Seller or the Shareholder to repurchase any Covered Company Loan under this Section 10.2(c), Buyer shall (i) promptly notify Seller of the assertion by a third party of a repurchase obligation, and (ii) either (A) give the Seller or the Shareholder the opportunity to cure, remedy or mitigate the Event, fact, claims, breach or other condition, as applicable, resulting in the repurchase obligation, and to assert defenses against such repurchase demand directly against the Investor making such repurchase demand, or (B) at the Seller or the Shareholder's request use reasonable efforts, in cooperation with and at the reasonable direction of Seller or the Shareholder, and at their cost and expense, to cure, remedy or mitigate the Event, fact, claim, breach or other condition resulting in the repurchase obligation, including using reasonable efforts to assert defenses or achieve a mutually agreeable settlement with a party entitled to require repurchase from Buyer.  <BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;In the event that, for the first due date for a Company Mortgage Loan on or subsequent to the Closing Date, the initial monthly payment is not made within thirty (30) days of such due date, or for the second or third due dates following the Closing Date, the related monthly payment is not made within thirty (30) days of such due date, then the Seller or the Shareholder shall repurchase such Company Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price upon demand of the Buyer.  Prior to Buyer causing the Seller or the Shareholder to repurchase any Company Mortgage Loan under this Section 10.2(d), the Buyer shall (i) give the Seller or the Shareholder the opportunity to collect the amounts due under such Company Mortgage Loan, or (ii) at the Seller or the Shareholder's request, and at their cost and expense, use reasonable efforts, in cooperation with and at the reasonable direction of Seller or the Shareholder, to collect the amounts due under such Company Mortgage Loan. <BR>
<BR>
For purposes of this section, (i) "Repurchase Price" means, with respect to any Company Mortgage Loan, a price equal to (A) the Stated Principal Balance of such mortgage loan, plus (B) interest on such Stated Principal Balance at the Mortgage Note interest rate from and including the last due date through which interest has been paid by or on behalf of the Mortgagor to either: (I) in the case where the Investor purchasing such mortgage loan was required in connection with such purchase to advance a full month's interest, the first day of the month following the date of repurchase, or (II) in all other cases, the date of repurchase of such mortgage loan, less, in each case, amounts received in respect of such repurchased mortgage loan which are being held for distribution in connection with such mortgage loan, plus (C) any unreimbursed servicing advances and any unpaid servicing fees allocable to such mortgage loan paid by any party other than the Seller, plus (D) any Losses incurred by the Buyer or the servicer in respect of the breach or defect giving rise to the repurchase obligation including any Losses incurred by any such party in connection with any violation by any such mortgage loan of any predatory or abusive lending Law, plus (E) any Final LHFS Other Accounts Amount related to such loan, as equitably allocated, (ii) "Stated Principal Balance" means, as to each Company Mortgage Loan as of any date of determination, (A) the principal balance of such Mortgage Loan as of the Closing Date, minus (B) all amounts previously distributed to the Buyer or its transferee with respect to the such mortgage loan representing payments or recoveries of principal; and (iii) "Approved Investor" means Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or GNMA or any of the following companies or their Affiliates: Bear Sterns/EMC; Chase; Citimortgage/Citibank; Countrywide; CSFB; Deutsche Bank; GMAC; Goldman Sachs; Greenpoint; Impac; IndyMac; Lehman/Aurora; Morgan Stanley; National City; RFC; Washington Mutual; or Wells Fargo.  <BR>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or agreements given or made by Buyer in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any certificate, instrument or document delivered to Seller pursuant to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; provided, however, that if any such covenant or agreement is qualified in any respect by materiality, for purposes of this provision such materiality qualification will in all respects be ignored;</P>

<P>&#9;(i)&#9;No claim may be asserted nor may any action be commenced against the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.3(a)(i) unless written notice of such claim or action is received by the Buyer describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 10.1, unless otherwise provided herein, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date.</P>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against the Buyer, the amount of each claim by a Seller Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments by the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.3(a) shall be limited to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contributions or other similar payment paid by any third party with respect thereto.</P>

<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;No indemnity shall be payable pursuant to Section 10.3(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate of all Losses suffered by Seller Indemnified Parties shall exceed the Indemnity Threshold in the aggregate, and then only to the extent of Losses in excess of such amount.  The dollar threshold set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to Losses resulting from fraud or intentional misconduct by the Buyer or its Affiliates, which shall be recoverable without respect to such threshold.<BR>
<BR>
10.4  <U>Indemnification Procedures.<BR>
<BR>
</U>(a)&#9;Any Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party (each, an "Indemnified Party") seeking indemnification hereunder shall give to the Party obligated to provide indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitor") written notice of any claim or matter that gives rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder (a "Claim Notice"), promptly upon becoming aware of a fact, condition or event for which indemnification is provided under this Article X but in any event within thirty (30) days after such Person has actual knowledge of the facts constituting the basis for indemnification; provided, however, that the failure of an Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnitor of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the rights of any such Indemnitor.  The Claim Notice shall set forth Indemnified Party's good faith reasonable estimate of all Losses incurred or expected to be incurred pursuant to the claim.<BR>
<BR>
(b)&#9;The Indemnitor shall have the right to control and direct, through counsel of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, the defense or settlement of any proceeding brought by a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party (a "Third Party Claim"), so long as (i) the Indemnitor is not otherwise a party to the proceeding or the Indemnified Party has otherwise determined in good faith that there would be no conflict of interest, (ii) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iii) the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently and (iv) the Indemnitor keeps the Indemnified Party apprised of all developments, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third Party Claim and permits the Indemnified Party to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim.  With respect to any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be liable for any settlement of such action effected pursuant to and in accordance with this section and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal).<BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 10.4(b); (i) the Indemnitor will not be responsible for any attorneys' fees incurred by the Indemnified Party regarding the Third Party Claim (other than reasonable attorneys' fees incurred prior to the Indemnitor's assumption of the defense pursuant to Section 10.4(b)) and (ii) neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnitor will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action, and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to effect a settlement over the objection of the Indemnitor; provided, however, that if (i) the Indemnitor is contesting the claim in good faith or (ii) the Indemnitor has assumed the defense from the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party must waive any right to indemnity therefor from Indemnitor. In no event shall the refusal of a Party to enter into or consent to a settlement that requires such Party to admit liability be considered unreasonable.<BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;If any condition in Section 10.4(b) is or becomes unsatisfied, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim with the consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (ii) the Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically (but no less often than monthly) for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and (iii) the Indemnitor will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may incur relating to or arising out of the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article X.  <BR>
<BR>
10.5  <U>Limitations.<BR>
<BR>
</U>(a)&#9;To the extent that any Event, fact, claim, breach or other condition giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement against the Seller is capable of cure, remedy or mitigation, the Buyer must, as a condition precedent to asserting a claim for indemnification with respect thereto, afford the Seller a reasonable opportunity to cure, remedy or mitigate the Event, fact, claim, breach or other condition.  The Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts and/or assist the Seller, to cure, remedy or mitigate the Event, fact, claim, breach or other condition at the Seller's sole cost and expense. <BR>
<BR>
(b)&#9;To the extent the Seller or Shareholder indemnifies the Buyer with respect to any claim under this Agreement, the Buyer will assign to the Seller, to the fullest extent allowable, its rights and causes of action with respect to such claim against other Persons, or in the event assignment is not permissible, the Seller will be allowed to pursue, at the Seller's expense, such claim in the name of the Buyer.  If there are recoveries with respect to such a claim, the Seller will be entitled to retain all such recoveries.  The Buyer will provide the Seller and the Shareholder reasonable assistance in pursuing any such claim, including making its books and records relating to such claim available to the Seller, its Affiliates and Representatives, and making its employees available for interviews, testimony and similar assistance.  If the Buyer or any of its Affiliates recovers from a third party any part of a claim that has previously been paid by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer will promptly remit to the Seller the amount paid by the Seller as indemnification with respect to such claim.  <BR>
<BR>
(c)&#9;"Losses" shall not include any losses, liabilities, damages, remediation costs, fines, penalties, demands, claims, actions, judgments, causes of action, costs and expenses (a) relating to the passing of, or any change in, any Law after the date of this Agreement even if the change has retroactive effect or (b) resulting from the Buyer's failure to comply with any Laws after the Closing Date.  "Losses" shall be calculated net of Tax benefits actually realized and, as provided in Sections 10.2(b)(ii) and 10.3(b)(ii), any indemnity, contributions or other payments paid by any third party with respect thereto.  "Losses" do not include incidental or consequential damages or diminution in value.  No "multiple of earnings" or other similar Loss calculation methodology will be applied in calculating any Loss that may be claimed hereunder.<BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;After the Closing, except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law, the enforcement of the indemnification provisions of Article X shall be the exclusive remedy, other than in the case of fraud of the Parties, for any breach of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that such exclusivity shall not limit or restrict a Party's ability to obtain specific performance or injunctive relief.<BR>

<BR>
(a)&#9;This Agreement may be terminated by written notice (given by the Buyer to the Seller or by the Seller to the Buyer, as the case may be):<BR>
</P>
<P>&#9;(i)&#9;by either the Seller or the Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2006 (the "Termination Date") (unless the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is attributable to a failure on the part of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any material obligation required to be performed by such Party at or prior to the Closing);</P>

<P>&#9;(ii)&#9;by either the Seller or the Buyer, if (A) the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets contemplated hereby violates any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction or (B) there exists a Law which makes the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited;</P>

<P>&#9;(iii)&#9;by the Buyer, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and if (A) at any time that any of the representations and warranties of the Seller herein become untrue or inaccurate such that Section 3.2(a) would not be satisfied or (B) there has been a breach on the part of the Seller of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that Section 3.2(b) would not be satisfied, and, in both case (A) and case (B), such breach (if curable) has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the Buyer has provided written notice of such breach to the Seller; or</P>

<P>&#9;(iv)&#9;by the Seller, if the Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, and if (A) at any time that any of the representations and warranties of the Buyer herein become untrue or inaccurate such that Section 3.3(a) would not be satisfied or (B) there has been a breach on the part of the Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that Section 3.3(b) would not be satisfied, and, in both case (A) and case (B), such breach (if curable) has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the Seller has provided written notice of such breach to the Buyer.<BR>

<BR>
(c)&#9;In no event shall any termination of this Agreement limit or restrict the rights and remedies of a Party hereto against the other Party which has willfully breached any of the agreements or other provisions of this Agreement prior to termination hereof.<BR>
<BR>
(d)&#9;In the event that (A)(i) all of the Seller's and the Shareholder's closing conditions set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 have been met, (ii) the Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with Section 11.3, and (iii) the Buyer agrees to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement but the Seller refuses to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 11.3(a)(i) and the condition set forth in Section 3.2(h) (No Seller Material Adverse Effect) is not satisfied at such time (other than as a result of the departure of any Seller employee or employees or the unwillingness of any Seller employee or employees to accept employment with Buyer), then the Seller or the Shareholder shall reimburse the Buyer for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred by the Buyer and its Affiliates on or prior to date of such refusal to close or termination and incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to (but not to exceed) the amount of $1,300,000.

Any such expenses due hereunder shall be paid within three (3) Business Days after the Party to be reimbursed has submitted to the other Party reasonable documentation evidencing the amount of such expenses and fees.
